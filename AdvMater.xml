         <title>Exceptional Thermal Conductivity in Printed Dielectrics through Compositional and Microstructural Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;generational compositional design creates a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promotes templated crystallization in a polymer matrix from surface&#8208;modified particles, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network.&#8221; The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals.








Abstract
As electronic devices become simultaneously more powerful and compact, thermal management is increasingly critical. Optimizing components like heatsinks is increasingly required, which has recently leveraged additive manufacturing. There is growing demand to move away from incumbent metallic materials for dielectric materials that are electrically insulative and &#160;transparent to radio frequency signals. Thermally conductive polymer composites containing phonon&#8208;conducting ceramics offer a low&#8208;density dielectric solution compatible with fused filament fabrication. However, these materials have struggled to exceed thermal conductivities of 4&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 due to challenging rheological flow effects at high filler volume fractions that prevent stable material extrusion. In this work, multi&#8208;generational compositional design is conducted to develop a printable low&#8208;loss dielectric composite that achieves over 16&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, comparable to stainless steel. This breakthrough is enabled by thermal post&#8208;processing, which promote templated crystallization in a poly&#8208;lactic acid &#160;matrix from surface&#8208;modified boron nitride platelets, creating a &#8220;hetero&#8208;percolated network&#8221;. The resulting material is three dimensionally printed into heatsinks that perform as effectively as metallic heatsinks while being electrically insulative and RF transparent.

         <title>Discovering Stable Amorphous Ceramics: From Computational Prediction to Thin&#8208;Film Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a computationally guided approach to discovering stable amorphous ceramics, using yttrium tungsten nitride (Y&#8208;W&#8208;N) as a prototype. By combining first&#8208;principles random structure sampling with thin&#8208;film synthesis, the authors identify and experimentally realize previously unreported amorphous nitrides, demonstrating their exceptional thermal stability, tunable properties, and superior diffusion barrier performance.








Abstract
Amorphous materials offer unique functional characteristics, which are not observed in their crystalline counterparts making them invaluable for many applications in science and technology, such as electronic and optical devices, solid&#8208;state batteries, and protective coatings. However, finding compositions that are stable against crystallization and/or phase separation, and at the same time offer the needed functionality in the amorphous phase is still largely done by serendipity or trial&#8208;and&#8208;error. In this work, using yttrium tungsten nitride as a prototype, it is shown how computational random structure sampling provides a robust method to identify compositions that exhibit a highly corrugated potential energy surface with many narrow local minima, which are consequently hard to crystallize and remain stable in the amorphous phase. Synthesis experiments prove that the predicted nitride is readily synthesized in an amorphous phase with no detectable precipitates. High&#8208;throughput and conventional characterization of structural, physical, and functional properties of the discovered amorphous nitride compound reveal its attractive properties and possible application potential. The proposed workflow combining theory and experiment is broadly applicable to the discovery of a wide range of amorphous ceramic materials, paving the way for advanced amorphous materials for diverse emerging technologies.

         <title>Protein&#8208;Nonfouling and Cell&#8208;Binding Polysulfobetaine Inducing Fast Transcytosis for Tumor&#8208;Active Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modulation of the N&#8208;alkyl chain length in polysulfobetaine&#8208;based zwitterionic micelles enables precise tuning of nanocarrier interactions with proteins and cell membranes. The optimized micelles comprising&#160;poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone) with N&#8208;butyl substituent (PSB4&#8208;PCL), which are protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;philic, achieve a unique balance between prolonged circulation and efficient tumor transcytosis, leading to enhanced intratumoral accumulation, deep penetration, and potent antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake are essential yet paradoxical requirements for efficient tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery carriers. For instance, polyzwitterions, generally nonfouling to proteins and cells, have been extensively explored as long&#8208;circulating drug delivery carriers but suffer ultraslow cell internalization, making them inefficient in delivering drugs to cells. Protein&#8208;resistant yet cell membrane&#8208;binding polymers will simultaneously achieve long blood circulation and fast cellular internalization, but their designs are generally complicated, such as introducing cell&#8208;membrane binding groups. Here, it is shown that the N&#8208;alkyl chain length of zwitterionic poly(sulfobetaine) can be used to tune its affinity toward proteins and cell membranes. A poly(sulfobetaine) with a moderately long N&#8208;alkyl chain became cell membrane&#8208;philic while retaining protein resistance, leading to long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake, which further triggered efficient tumor cell transcytosis and intratumor penetration. Thus, its paclitaxel (PTX)&#8208;loaded micelles demonstrated potent antitumor efficacy in triple&#8208;negative breast cancer models. This study showcases a paradigm of designing polyzwitterions harmonizing long blood circulation and fast cellular uptake properties as tumor&#8208;active drug delivery carriers.

         <title>Interface Field&#8208;Effect Passivation Enabled by Selectively Extruded Cations for Printable Mesoscopic Perovskite Solar Cells with Improved Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Field&#8208;effect passivation is achieved by selectively extruded tetraphenylphosphonium cations for suppressing the interfacial non&#8208;radiative recombination, yielding an improved power conversion efficiency of 21.0% for hole transport layer&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Mesoporous electron transport layer (ETL) in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) enables rapid and selective extraction of photogenerated electrons and facilitates device fabrication without a hole transport layer (HTL). However, the inherent mesoporous architecture introduces abundant interfacial defects that promote undesired non&#8208;radiative recombination, limiting the power conversion efficiency (PCE). To address this challenge, an interface field&#8208;effect passivation strategy is implemented, leveraging spatially selective cation extrusion. By incorporating tetraphenylphosphonium cations, sterically bulky organic ions that migrate to the perovskite/ETL interface during crystallization, a robust interfacial electrostatic field is introduced. This field simultaneously suppresses the non&#8208;radiative recombination by inducing field&#8208;effect passivation and enhances the charge extraction through optimizing energy alignment. The synergistic effects yield a PCE enhancement from 19.4% to 21.0%. This work underscores the potential of cation&#8208;engineered interfacial fields to improve the performance of HTL&#8208;free carbon&#8208;electrode perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Microneedle&#8208;Integrated FePc&#8211;MOF&#8211;MXene Nanozyme Patch for In Vivo L&#8208;Cysteine Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of a low energy synthesized FePc&#8211;MOF&#8211;MXene nanozyme&#8208;based microneedle patch coupled with an iontophoretic sampling interface for real&#8208;time in vivo L&#8208;Cysteine detection. The nanozyme enhances electron transfer and catalytic efficiency, while the microneedles and iontophoretic patch enable minimally invasive access to interstitial fluid. The platform demonstrates continuous, on&#8208;body monitoring performance in a live murine model.








Abstract
Advancing clinical diagnostics requires platforms that combine catalytic efficiency, biocompatibility, and real&#8208;time, in vivo accessibility. Herein, this study reports a structurally integrated FePc&#8211;ZIF&#8208;8&#8211;MX nanozyme that combines the redox activity of FePc, the porous confinement of ZIF&#8208;8, and the electrical conductivity of MX. Synthesized via a low&#8208;energy, ambient&#8208;condition process, this hybrid enables efficient electron transfer, enhanced analyte enrichment, and sustained catalytic activity in physiological environments. To translate this functionality into a wearable diagnostic format, the hybrid is seamlessly incorporated into a microneedle array, offering minimally invasive access to interstitial fluid for continuous L&#8208;cysteine (L&#8208;Cys) monitoring.

         <title>Efficient Red Perovskite LEDs with Iodine Management via Volatile Additive I2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental iodine (I2) is used to create an iodine&#8208;rich environment for inhibiting the formation of iodine vacancy defects. This strategy also modifies the perovskite's surface energy, regulating its crystallization kinetics and resulting in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with a preferred (001)&#8208;orientation. Consequently, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and 29.5% for pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) face a tough challenge that halogen vacancy defects limit device performance, while the introduction of additional agents to passivate defects may potentially compromise the stability of the structure and increase the complexity of the system. Here, elemental iodine (I2) is employed as an additive, utilizing its ability to create an iodine&#8208;rich condition and to transform into I&#8722; ions for passivating iodine vacancy defects, while its volatile nature ensures no residue and avoids the introduction of extraneous elements. This approach also alters the perovskite's surface energy and subsequently regulates its crystallization kinetics, which results in a more well&#8208;crystallized perovskite with vertically&#8208;aligned organic spacer layers, in turn promoting the transport of charge carriers. On the basis of this strategy, PeLEDs with efficiencies of 32.5% and 29.5% for deep&#8208;red (678 nm) and pure&#8208;red (649 nm) have been achieved, respectively.

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Free Dual&#8208;Anion Regulation for High&#8208;Efficient Sn&#8208;Pb and All&#8208;perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic strategy that combines acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) from formamidinium acetate and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8208;) from guanidinium thiocyanate to produce high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite films via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Ac&#8722; anions retard crystallization and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation through the formation of intermediate phases and anion exchange process, while SCN&#8208; anions further promote crystal growth and stabilize Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions, improving energy level alignment and grain boundary management.








Abstract
Mixed tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskites are integral to all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs), offering significant potential to surpass the theoretical efficiency limits of single&#8208;junction solar cells. However, the rapid crystallization of Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite thin films and the propensity of Sn2+ to oxidize into Sn4+ remain critical challenges, hindering device performance and stability. Herein, it is demonstrated that a multifunctional dual&#8208;anion synergistic regulation strategy to fabricate high&#8208;quality MA&#8208;free Cs0.1FA0.9Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite thin films with superior morphology and crystallinity via a simplified antisolvent&#8208;free spin&#8208;coating process. Acetate anions (Ac&#8722;) derived from formamidinium acetate (FAAc) effectively regulate crystallization kinetics and mitigate Sn2+ oxidation via intermediate phase formation and anion exchange process. Simultaneously, the combination of Ac&#8722; and thiocyanate anions (SCN&#8722;) from guanidinium thiocyanate (GuaSCN) promotes larger crystal grain growth and stabilizes Sn2+ via strong coordination interactions. The dual&#8208;anion strategy effectively minimizes grain boundaries, suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination, and optimizes the energy level alignment at interfaces. As a result, the champion single&#8208;junction Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite solar cell (PSC) achieves an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.26%, setting a new benchmark for Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs fabricated without antisolvent. While all&#8208;perovskite TSCs reach 28.07% efficiency with remarkable operational stability, retaining 81% of initial performance after 600 h under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Enhancing Thermal Tolerance for Bright and Stable Near&#8208;Infrared Perovskite LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers developed ultra&#8208;stable near&#8208;infrared perovskite LEDs with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% from 70 to 1200 mA cm&#8722;2, resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. Furthermore, these PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability at high current densities. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation display technologies, owing to their high efficiency and color purity. However, the operational instability of PeLEDs at high current densities (&gt;100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Here, near&#8208;infrared (&#8776;797&#160;nm) PeLEDs are reported with peak external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of &#8776;24.7% and EQEs of &gt;20% across a wide range of current densities (70&#8211;1200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), resulting in an ultra&#8208;high peak radiance of 2270&#8201;W&#8201;sr&#8722;1&#8201;m&#8722;2. These PeLEDs exhibit outstanding operational stability with operational lifetimes (T50) of 6.6, 12.7, 19.2, 49.5, 238.6, and 350&#160;h at current densities of 500, 400, 300, 200, 100, and 50&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2, respectively. The high stability is enabled by a multifunctional stabilizer containing formamidine groups, which prevent phase transition and decomposition of the &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite under elevated temperatures. This work demonstrates the feasibility of achieving efficient and stable PeLEDs at high current densities, providing strategies for the development of high&#8208;power optoelectronic devices based on halide perovskites.

         <title>Highly Repeatable and Cyclically Stable Mechanoluminescence of the Flexible Composite Elastomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a solid&#8208;solution strategy to modulate the mechanoluminescence of the composite elastomer with the physical principles proposed. With no need for power supply and circuit design, the developed CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer yields bright and repeatable light for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions, significantly breaking the performance limitations of the existing materials.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) elastomer shows tremendous potential for the next generation of flexible displaying, imaging, and sensing devices. However, inadequate repeatability and cyclic stability are the current bottlenecks. In this work, a solid&#8208;solution strategy is reported to regulate the interfacial interactions of ML elastomer, in which the (Ca,Ba)5(PO4)3Cl:Eu solid solutions and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are employed, respectively. The results suggest that the solid&#8208;solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa4(PO4)3Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions. This work not only provides a highly repeatable and cyclically stable ML elastomer but also clarifies the intrinsic physical principles, showing high guiding significance for future ML design and applications.

&lt;p&gt;This work presents a solid-solution strategy to modulate the mechanoluminescence of the composite elastomer with the physical principles proposed. With no need for power supply and circuit design, the developed CaBa&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer yields bright and repeatable light for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions, significantly breaking the performance limitations of the existing materials.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanoluminescence (ML) elastomer shows tremendous potential for the next generation of flexible displaying, imaging, and sensing devices. However, inadequate repeatability and cyclic stability are the current bottlenecks. In this work, a solid-solution strategy is reported to regulate the interfacial interactions of ML elastomer, in which the (Ca,Ba)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl:Eu solid solutions and polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) are employed, respectively. The results suggest that the solid-solution strategy can effectively modulate the energy position of the valence band and the charge density distributions of the lowest unoccupied band, as well as the interfacial triboelectrification. Consequently, the ML performance of the composite elastomer in terms of intensity, spectral characteristic, and repeatability has been significantly improved. Particularly, the optimum CaBa&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Cl:Eu/PDMS elastomer exhibits stable and repeatable ML for over 20&#160;000 cycles under various rapid and continuous stretching conditions.

         <title>Highly Specific Cytokine Receptor&#8208;Targeting Chimeras for Targeted Membrane Protein Degradation and Sensitization of Osimertinib in EGFR&#8208;Mutated Non&#8208;Small&#8208;Cell Lung Cancer</title>

CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimeras (AP&#8208;CRTACs), which are constructed by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide, can specifically harness the scavenge receptor CXCR7 to direct membrane proteins of interest (POIs) to the lysosome for degradation, while eliminating the effects of CXCL12 on its another receptor CXCR4 activation and tumor cell viability.








Abstract
The ability of cytokine receptors to mediate the internalization of targets in lysosomes positions them as specific and effective effectors for protein degradation strategies. However, challenges remain, including the potential unintended activation of cell&#8208;proliferation&#8208;related cytokine receptors, as well as limitations in programmability and structural flexibility of protein degradators. In this work, a CXCR7&#8208;targeting chimera (AP&#8208;CRTAC) that functions as a CXCR7 inducer by covalently linking a membrane protein&#8208;targeting aptamer with a mutant&#8208;CXCL12 mimic peptide is developed. This peptide selectively binds to CXCR7 without activating CXCR4. The AP&#8208;CRTAC, which incorporates various aptamer forms from DNA, RNA, or even bispecific aptamers, has shown significant efficacy in degrading one or more proteins or protein mutants on the cell surface. Moreover, the AP&#8208;CRTAC constructed with a 2&#8242; F&#8208;pyrimidine&#8208;modified RNA aptamer targeting EGFR effectively degrades various EGFR activating mutations. Notably, AP&#8208;CRTAC enhances the sensitivity of the L858R/T790M/C797S triple mutant lung cancer cells, which are resistant to current EGFR&#8208;targeted therapies, to the third&#8208;generation EGFR inhibitor osimertinib in both in vitro and in vivo settings. This research introduces an engineered CXCR7 inducer with high specificity and programmability for the targeted degradation of cell surface proteins, while minimizing unwanted side effects.

         <title>Interface Design of Solid&#8211;Liquid Hybrid Electrodes for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Flexible Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

This work proposes a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The electrode structure includes: an upper liquid metal phase containing silicon microparticles, which can connect fractured silicon and form a stable interface during cycling processes; and a lower solid&#8208;phase copper&#8208;gallium alloy, which ensures the robust adhesion of the electrode to the current collector during flexing processes.








Abstract
The silicon microparticles (SiMPs) offer a promising solution for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion battery systems. However, the inevitable volume expansion (&gt;300%) of SiMPs during alloying often leads to particle breakage, interface rupture, and electrode separation, resulting in rapid capacity decay. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed for designing a novel solid&#8211;liquid hybrid electrode (Si@EGaSn) for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The Si@EGaSn electrode has a liquid&#8208;phase top layer containing SiMPs and a solid&#8208;phase copper gallium alloy bottom layer. The top layer can not only electrically connect the fractured SiMPs, but also form a stable solid electrolyte interface during alloying processes. The bottom layer can firmly adhere the electrodes to the current collector. Consequently, the optimal Si@EGaSn electrode delivers a highly reversible capacity of 767.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 and a high capacity retention of &gt;99% during 200 cycles. After loading the electrode into metallic textiles, the assembled high&#8208;voltage pouch cell of NCM811//Si@EGaSn shows a high areal capacity of 3.2 mAh cm&#8722;2, high volumetric energy density of 500&#160;Wh L&#8722;1 and negligible capacity decay during 3000 flexing cycles at a small bending radius of 4.0&#160;mm. This work provides a new electrode design approach to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Programmable Bacterial Architects Crafting Sonosensitizers for Tumor&#8208;Specific Sonodynamic Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered bacterium SPEC5, designed via genetic circuit optimization and tumor cell membrane camouflage, functions as a live drug for efficient and precise tumor&#8208;selective sonosensitizer supply. SPEC5 colonizes tumor tissues, ensuring sustained 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) delivery into tumor cells, triggers in situ protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) biosynthesis, and enables effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach for precise SDT using living engineered bacterial therapeutics.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is a non&#8208;invasive cancer treatment that uses ultrasound to activate sonosensitizers for selective tumor ablation. With its superior tissue penetration compared to photodynamic therapy, SDT demonstrates the potential to stimulate antitumor immune responses by modulating the tumor microenvironment. However, its clinical application remains limited by poor tumor specificity and suboptimal sonosensitizer accumulation, which reduces efficacy and causes off&#8208;target effects. To address these challenges, an Engineered Probiotic&#8208;based Calibrated 5&#8208;ALA Supply system (SPEC5) is developed to confer tumor selectivity for SDT. Engineered non&#8208;pathogenic E. coli with recombinant plasmids enables efficient 5&#8208;ALA biosynthesis through kinetic remodeling. Homologous tumor cell membrane cloaking further enhances tumor targeting and immune evasion. Upon intravenous injection, SPEC5 selectively colonizes in the tumor, supporting the sonosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX) in situ biosynthesis via 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (5&#8208;ALA) continuous supply. A hypoxia&#8208;inducible promoter regulating O&#8208;acetylserine sulfhydrylase ensures the tumor specificity of PpIX production. This system achieves robust sensitizer accumulation in tumors, enhancing SDT efficacy and inducing potent antitumor immune activation with minimal systemic toxicity. Post&#8208;treatment, the bacteria are rapidly cleared to ensure safety. This study presents a novel strategy for tumor&#8208;specific sonosensitizer supply, revolutionizing 5&#8208;ALA&#8208;based SDT and paving the way for advanced tumor&#8208;targeted therapies with enhanced immunotherapeutic outcomes.

         <title>Aqueous Colloidal Perovskite Quantum Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile structural transformation&#8208;induced in situ core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly for constructing mono&#8208;dispersed aqueous colloidal perovskite nanocrystals, exhibiting unprecedented aqueous solution single photon emission.








Abstract
Aqueous solutions of nanoparticles are the cornerstones for applications in diagnostics, catalysis and more, where control over the nanoparticle's dispersion is pivotal to tailoring the final product properties. Of late, halide perovskite nanocrystals (HPNCs) with outstanding optoelectronic properties emerge as a class of semiconductor nanocrystals distinct from the incumbents. However, HPNCs are particularly susceptible to moisture induced degradation, limiting their utility and regulation in aqueous environments. Here, this hurdle is overcome to realize stable, mono&#8208;disperse, highly emissive HPNCs in aqueous environments even under ultra&#8208;dilute conditions. These colloidal HPNCs are synthesized via a facile room&#8208;temperature structural transformation&#8208;induced&#160;in situ&#160;core&#8208;shell self&#8208;assembly mechanism in contrast to the widely used pre&#8208;core&#8208;shell approach. The green HPNCs exhibit &gt;80% photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) with excellent water dispersion stability (i.e., zeta potential &gt;80 mV) even after &gt;10,000 h in water. Unprecedented aqueous solution phase single&#8208;photon emission with&#160;g(2)(0) &lt;0.2 at concentrations as low as &#8776;0.1 nM is measured. These aqueous HPNCs offer full color tunability&#160;that covers the entire Rec. 2020 standard. These findings will lay the foundation for innovative applications of HPNCs in aqueous environments, unlocking new opportunities for nanoscale sensing and optofluidics in photonics, environmental science, and materials engineering.

         <title>Cyanobenzene&#8208;Modified Quinoxaline&#8208;Based Acceptors with Optimal Excitonic Behavior Enable Efficient Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four novel small molecule acceptors (SMAs) are synthesized by regulating central&#8208;core cyanobenzene substitution for the first time. The asymmetric substitution increases the power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells to 20.16%. The corresponding device exhibits higher thermal stability and better excitonic behavior, providing important insights for the design of SMAs.








Abstract
Cyanogroup (&#8208;CN) is a strongly electron&#8208;withdrawing and highly polar functional group; therefore, cyanation has been extensively utilized to optimize the terminal groups of high&#8208;performance small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) in organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, by regulating the cyanobenzene substitution in the central core for the first time, four novel SMAs are synthesized, named phCN&#8208;F, phCN&#8208;Cl, 2phCN&#8208;F, and 2phCN&#8208;Cl. Theoretical and experimental analyses have shown that asymmetric and symmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, coupled with selective terminal groups, can significantly affect the intrinsic excitonic properties of the molecule. Blends based on asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution molecules possess tighter molecular packing and more suitable phase separation to facilitate exciton dissociation, charge transport, and charge extraction. The optimal device performance of the phCN&#8208;F&#8208;based OSC reaches 20.16%, which is significantly higher than that of symmetrically substituted OSCs. Furthermore, devices prepared based on phCN&#8208;F maintain over 90% of their initial efficiency after being heated at 85&#176;C for 3000 h, demonstrating excellent thermal stability. This study elucidates the potential mechanisms for optimizing device performance through asymmetric cyanobenzene&#8208;substitution of the central core, providing valuable insights for the further design of record&#8208;breaking SMAs.

         <title>&#960;&#8208;Conjugated Microporous Hydrocarbon Electrodes for High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Voltage Lithium&#8208;Ion Capacitors</title>

High&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage &#960;&#8208;conjugated microporous hydrocarbon electrodes are designed and prepared for lithium&#8208;ion capacitors, featuring a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar structure with sp2&#8208;hybridized carbon atoms to facilitate rapid electron migration; abundant oxygen&#8208;free edge C(sp2)&#8211;H sites for efficient ion storage within nanopores; and a well&#8208;developed internal nanopore structure to enhance ion diffusion. Accordingly, the symmetric capacitor achieved unprecedented energy density and power density.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based cathodes are widely utilized in lithium&#8208;ion capacitors due to their superior cycle stability, safety, and tolerance to overcharging compared to oxide&#8208;based cathodes. However, the limited capacity of carbon cathodes, primarily governed by the electric double&#8208;layer capacitance mechanism, constrains their energy storage potential. Conventional strategies like increasing surface area and pore volume have provided marginal improvements, while heteroatom doping has been restricted by low working voltage and compromised conductivity. To overcome these limitations, a novel class of &#960;&#8208;conjugated microporous hydrocarbons (CMHs) is developed using sub&#8208;graphitic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) as building blocks. These materials PPe, PPy, and PAn feature carbon&#8208;like large &#960;&#8208;conjugated surfaces, abundant oxygen&#8208;free edge C(sp2)&#8211;H sites, and well&#8208;defined microporous structures, facilitating anion adsorption and ion transport. Among them, PPe demonstrates exceptional performance with a high voltage of 3.13 V vs Li+/Li, a remarkable capacity of 241 mAh g&#8722;1 2.5 times of commercial activated carbon (YP50), and exceptional rate performance (up to 50 A g&#8722;1), far surpassing all other reported LIC cathode materials. These findings provide a fundamental design strategy for carbon&#8208;based cathodes in LICs that highlighting the role of &#960;&#8208;conjugation and edge chemistry in electrochemical performance, paving the way for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;voltage energy storage devices.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art Structural Regulation Methods and Quantum Chemistry for Carbon&#8208;Based Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts in Advanced Oxidation Process: Critical Perspectives into Molecular Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review aims to provide comprehensive molecular&#8208;level insights regarding catalytic oxidation mechanisms by carbon&#8208;based SACs, especially the coupling of the &#8220;oxidants&#8208;catalysts&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal molecular&#8208;level relationships. It is worth clarifying that all the molecular&#8208;level insights eventually are served for the development of scale&#8208;up engineering, which will satisfy the demand for actual wastewater.








Abstract
Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) by carbon&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are recognized as an attractive scientific frontier for water treatment, with the outstanding benefits of ultra&#8208;effective and anti&#8208;interference capability. However, most of the research has paid more attention to the performance of SACs, while the in&#8208;depth understanding of catalytic regulation by molecular interaction is relatively deficient. This critical review delves into deciphering the catalytic mechanism through a micro&#8208;level, which makes it more convenient to interpret apparent catalytic phenomena. It first summarizes basic theories of quantum chemistry, which provide mechanism interpretation and prediction for molecular&#8208;oxidation systems. Additionally, corresponding oxidation pathways of common oxidants are underscored. Following the oxidants, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art regulation methods are discussed with special attention to involved molecular interactions and pollutants. Particularly, the preliminary insights into the &#8220;oxidant&#8208;catalyst&#8208;pollutants&#8221; internal relationships are provided to help construct the SAC&#8208;AOP system from a molecular standpoint. Meanwhile, some cutting&#8208;edge laboratory devices and pilot&#8208;scale engineering are presented to illustrate the ultimate purpose of scientific molecular exploration. Eventually, relative challenges of SACs&#8208;AOPs upon the design of catalytic systems and investigation methods are provided. This review aims to promote the large&#8208;scale potential of SACs&#8208;based AOPs in practical water treatment by emphasizing the pivotal role of micro&#8208;insights.

An LLM&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network screens academic literature to propose multiple environmentally friendly aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Experiments identify an optimal composition of Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O and ethylene carbonate, which shows high conductivity and cycling stability. Spectroscopy and simulations confirm corrosion suppression and stable solid electrolyte interphases, establishing an AI&#8208;driven paradigm for electrolyte discovery.








Abstract
Aqueous deep eutectic electrolytes (DEEs) offer great potential for low&#8208;cost zinc&#8208;ion batteries but often have limited performance. Discovering new electrolytes is therefore crucial, yet time&#8208;consuming and resource&#8208;intensive. In response, this work presents a Large Language Model (LLM)&#8208;based multi&#8208;agent network that proposes DEE compositions for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By analyzing academic papers from the DEE field, the network identifies innovative, inexpensive, and sustainable Lewis bases to pair with Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O. A Zn(BF4)2&#183;xH2O&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC) system demonstrates high conductivity (10.6 mS cm&#8722;1) and a wide electrochemical stability window (2.37&#160;V). The optimized electrolyte enables stable zinc stripping/plating, achieves outstanding rate performance (81 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and supports 4000 cycles in Zn||polyaniline cells at 3 A g&#8722;1. Spectroscopic analyses and simulations reveal that EC coordinates to Zn2+, mitigating water&#8208;induced corrosion, while a fluorine&#8208;rich hybrid organic/inorganic solid electrolyte interphase enhances stability. This work showcases a pioneering LLM&#8208;driven approach to electrolyte development, establishing a new paradigm in materials research.

         <title>Photosensitive Biomimetic Nanomedicine&#8208;Mediated Recombination of Adipose Microenvironments for Antiobesity Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel dual&#8208;targeted photosensitive biomimetic nanodelivery system is developed to accurately deliver astaxanthin and rosiglitazone to inflamed regions of the WAT, where it can correct lipid metabolism disorders while facilitating the reprogramming of M1&#8208;like macrophages for dual regulatory functions.








Abstract
Obesity&#8208;induced insulin resistance is a hallmark of metabolic syndrome, and chronic low&#8208;grade inflammation links obesity to insulin resistance through the activation of tissue&#8208;infiltrating immune cells. Current treatments are lacking in efficacy and immunosuppression. Therefore, novel therapies are needed to prevent chronic inflammation and alleviate obesity&#8208;related insulin resistance. In this work, novel red light&#8208;responsive biomimetic nanoparticles (RSCP NPs) are reported to perform targeted delivery of multiple drugs and effectively reduce nonspecific enrichment. These results showed that the dual&#8208;targeting and multiple&#8208;signaling response (red light signaling and different pH microenvironments) of the RSCP NPs enabled the precise delivery of astaxanthin (Asta) and rosiglitazone (Rosi) to M1&#8208;like macrophages and white adipocytes, respectively, to alleviate the low&#8208;grade inflammation of white adipose tissue (WAT) and promote white adipocyte browning. Moreover, RSCP NPs&#8208;mediated Asta and Rosi treatment robustly alleviated insulin resistance and other metabolic disorders in the obese animal models (high&#8208;fat diet (HFD)&#8208;induced or genetically obese mice). Overall, this study provides a theoretical and practical basis for the development and application of novel drug delivery systems for metabolic diseases by elucidating the synergistic long&#8208;term targeting mechanism and target molecule stability of red light&#8208;sensitive bionic nanodrug delivery systems.

         <title>Atomic Scale Engineering of Multivalence&#8208;State Palladium Photocatalyst for Transfer Hydrogenation with Water as a Proton Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation is achieved over a multivalence&#8208;state palladium photocatalyst, in which protons generated from photocatalytic water splitting are added to unsaturated double bonds. The operando light&#8208;induced Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) spectroscopy confirms the synergistic action between Pd single atoms and nanoparticles, in which the H&#8208; produced by palladium nanoparticles migrate to single atoms where the substrate is located, resulting in hydrogenation reaction.









Abstract
Hydrogenation reactions are fundamental in the fine chemical, pharmaceutical, and petrochemical industries, however heavily relying on H2 gas at high temperatures and pressures, incurring large energy and carbon costs. Photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation, using water as a proton source, offers a greener alternative, but&#160;existing photocatalysts often suffer from&#160;modest yields, limited selectivity, and narrow substrate scope. Additionally, they often require co&#8208;activation, such as Mg&#8208;activated water or non&#8208;sustainable hydrogen feeds. Here, a photocatalyst is introduced that offers high yields and selectivities across a broad spectrum of organic compounds. The developed photocatalyst is a multivalence palladium superstructure with&#160;ultrasmall Pd0 nanoparticles enveloped by isolated Pd2+/Pd4+ atoms within a carbon&#8208;nitride matrix. Mechanistic studies reveal that the redox&#8208;flexible Pd single atoms, with triethylamine as an electronic modulator, attract photogenerated holes for water oxidation, while Pd0 nanoparticles facilitate hydrogen transfer to the unsaturated bonds of the organic molecules. The cooperative and dynamic behavior of Pd centers during catalysis, involving transitions among Pd+2, Pd+3, and Pd+4 states, is validated using operando electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. This multivalent palladium catalyst represents a conceptual advance in photocatalytic transfer hydrogenation with water as a hydrogen source, holding promise for sustainable hydrogenation processes in the chemical industry.

         <title>Inorganic Hydrogels can be Flexible and Highly Extensible</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional inorganic hydrogels are usually rigid or fragile, which limits their applications. By crosslinking long&#8208;chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ni2+, etc.), flexible and extensible inorganic polymer hydrogels can be obtained. It is found that the Ni&#8208;LPP hydrogel is highly extensible, conductive, self&#8208;healing, and arbitrarily shapeable. The Ni2+&#8208;phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor.









Abstract
Inorganic hydrogels have great potential in many applications as sustainable materials, but lack flexibility due to rigid network structures. Here, a novel strategy is proposed&#8212;an inorganic polymer hydrogel, prepared by crosslinking long&#8208;chain polyphosphate (LPP) with M2+ ions (Ca2+, Mn2+, Mg2+, Ni2+), which effectively address the rigidity and fragility issues commonly associated with traditional inorganic gels. With the most stable hydration shell among those ions, Ni2+ tends to interact indirectly with LPP through hydrogen bonds rather than coordination bonds. The unique Ni2+&#8208;phosphate interaction endows the Ni&#8208;LPP hydrogels with ultrahigh elongation at break (&#8776;15&#8201;000&#215;). Further experiments reveal that the Ni2+&#8208;phosphate motif can be applied to other hydrogels as an extension enhancement factor. The highly extensible, good conductive (1.06 &#177; 0.08 S m&#8722;1), self&#8208;healing (within 30 s and without stimulation), arbitrarily shapeable, and nonflammable Ni&#8208;LPP inorganic hydrogel indicates a bright future in flexible electronics, environmental remediation, and beyond.

         <title>A Kagome Metallic Composite Realizes Mechanically Axial Zero Thermal Expansion up to 800 K</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kagome metallic composite is used to prepare high&#8208;strength two&#8208;phase zero thermal expansion alloys. By in situ precipitation of the plastic &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase yields zero thermal expansion alloys with ultra&#8208;wide temperature windows and excellent compressive strength. This method can be extended to other Fe&#8208;based negative thermal expansion systems for high performance in the future.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal structure and microstructure is fundamentally paramount for designing advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. Kagome&#8208;lattice metals attracted considerable attention due to desirable electronic and magnetic properties but are rarely considered for application as structural materials. In this study, a concept of kagome composite is proposed to realize mechanically zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy over a wide temperature window, exemplified by the Lu&#8208;Fe&#8208;Co ternary alloys prepared by two&#8208;step synthesis. Using magnetic Co doping, the kagome lattice magnetic order is stabilized in the parent hexagonal Lu2Fe17 structure, and its thermal expansion regulated simultaneously. By in situ precipitation of the &#945;&#8208;(Fe/Co) phase in the matrix, a soft/hard heterogeneous structure emerges and an ultra&#8208;wide temperature window axial ZTE composite (&#945;l = +0.98 &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1, 110&#8211;800 K) with good compressive strength (1.11&#160;GPa) is achieved. This work opens up the prospect of kagome intermetallic composite in the integration of structure and function.

Oxygen&#8208;vacancy lithium zirconate (O&#8208;LZO) reduces the bonding between lithium ion (Li+) and anions in lithium salts, promoting dissociation and increasing the concentration of free Li+. Kinetic simulations confirm the excellent intrinsic Li+ diffusion capability of O&#8208;LZO. As an active filler, O&#8208;LZO broadens Li+ transport pathways and enhances the dissociation and distribution of lithium salts, improving overall electrolyte performance.








Abstract
The low concentration and inhomogenous distribution of free lithium ion (Li+) in composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs) greatly restrict the Li+ transport, cycle stability and rate performance of all solid&#8208;state batteries. In this work, lithium zirconate with superficial oxygen (O)&#8208;vacancies (O&#8208;LZO) is reported as a new Li+ conductors for polyethylene oxide (PEO)&#8208;based CPEs (PEO@O&#8208;LZO). The O&#8208;LZO demonstrates exceptional Li+ transport capability, and its superficial O&#8208;vacancies efficiently adsorb anions to facilitate the dissociation of lithium salts, leading a high concentration of free Li+ in CPEs. Furthermore, the electropositive equilibrium charge layer of O&#8208;vacancies avoids the aggregation of Li+ near the filler and achieves a stable interface to promote the efficient and continuous Li+ transport. These effects contribute to a high Li+ conductivity of 1.63 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 and a Li+ migration number of 0.35 for PEO@O&#8208;LZO at 40&#160;&#176;C. The assembled battery (LiFePO4/PEO@O&#8208;LZO/Li) exhibits a capacity of 120 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 C and stable cycling performance with an 80.5% capacity retention after 800 cycles at 1 C and 40&#160;&#176;C, maintaining excellent coulombic efficiency. This work provides a design principle of fillers to regulate Li+ concentration and distribution in CPEs for efficient solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Dynamic Switching Spin State of Fe Single Atoms for Piezoelectric&#8208;Mediated Overall Nitrogen Fixation Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an alternating piezoelectric field is introduced into Fe SAs anchored defective&#8208;BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), and dynamic and bidirectional switching of spin&#8208;states can be realized to simultaneously facilitate ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis for achieving record ONF activity and energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven one&#8208;step disproportionation overall nitrogen fixation (ONF) for synchronously synthesizing ammonia and nitrate presents a promising alternative to conventional Haber&#8208;Bosch and Ostwald processes, but suffers from ultra&#8208;low efficiency. Single atoms (SAs) featured by maximized atomic utilization exhibit superb catalytic activity, while the definite electronic configurations confine SAs to function solely as reduction or oxidation sites, limiting the possibility for both reduction and oxidation reactions. Herein, an efficient approach is presented for ammonia and nitrate co&#8208;synthesis by introducing Fe SAs and alternating piezoelectric field into a defective piezoelectric BaTiO3 (OvBTO&#8208;Fe), enabling the formation spatially&#8208;separated redox regions and dynamic bidirectional switching of Fe spin states. At positive and negative polarization ends, Fe spin state transitions to high and low spin states through d&#8208;electrons relocation, respectively, thermodynamically and kinetically facilitate nitrogen reduction and oxidation reactions. Thus, OvBTO&#8208;Fe exhibits unprecedented piezo&#8208;photocatalytic ONF activity, achieving a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 0.82% and total energy&#8208;to&#8208;chemical&#160;conversion efficiency of 0.53%. This work proposes a methodology for dynamic multi&#8208;directional manipulation of spin states and overall catalytic synthesis reaction.

         <title>Electrochemical Hydrogen Production Coupling with the Upgrading of Organic and Inorganic Chemicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the coupling of electrocatalytic H&#8322; production with the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals. The optimization synthesis strategy, catalytic activity, and structure&#8211;performance relationships of various electrocatalysts are summarized, and relevant catalytic reaction mechanisms and electrolytic cell configuration in practical application scenarios are discussed. Finally, the remaining challenges and prospects are further proposed.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic water splitting powered by renewable energy is a green and sustainable method for producing high&#8208;purity H2. However, in conventional water electrolysis, the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) involves a four&#8208;electron transfer process with inherently sluggish kinetics, which severely limits the overall efficiency of water splitting. Recently, replacing OER with thermodynamically favorable oxidation reactions, coupled with the hydrogen evolution reaction, has garnered significant attention and achieved remarkable progress. This strategy not only offers a promising route for energy&#8208;saving H&#8322; production but also enables the simultaneous synthesis of high&#8208;value&#8208;added products or the removal of pollutants at the anode. Researchers successfully demonstrate the upgrading of numerous organic and inorganic alternatives through this approach. In this review, the latest advances in the coupling of electrocatalytic H2 production and the upgrading of organic and inorganic alternative chemicals are summarized. What's more, the optimization strategy of catalysts, structure&#8211;performance relationship, and catalytic mechanism of various reactions are well discussed in each part. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are outlined, aiming to inspire further innovative breakthroughs in this exciting area of research.

         <dc:description>
Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Moreover, intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling.








Abstract
Wearable epidermic electronics assembled by conductive hydrogels exhibit great application potential for their seamless integration with the human body for human&#8208;machine interactions (HMI). However, most multifunctional hydrogel sensors are prone to water loss and become useless e&#8208;waste, resulting in a growing threat to the global environment and human health. Inspired by the resurrection plants, this paper introduces the reversible intermolecular forces and physical crosslinking method into the hydrogel system to obtain a fully recyclable multifunctional smart hydrogel sensor (RMSHS), which can be completely recycled in a simple step. Meanwhile, RMSHS possesses admirable biocompatibility, excellent antibacterial ability (S. aureus and E. coli bacterial inhibition rate of 99.8%), rapid self&#8208;healing ability, and outstanding sensing performances such as low detection limit, fast response/recovery time (160/200&#160;ms). Intelligent medical rehabilitation and smart HMI systems are developed for medical diagnostics and real&#8208;time remote controlling. Moreover, the recyclable triboelectric nanogenerator (R&#8208;TENG) intelligent array, designed based on RMSHS, replaces the electrode consumables in traditional TENGs, realizing the generation of green energy and 100% recyclability of electrode materials. RMSHS can be generalized and applied to other remote&#8208;controlling platforms, paving the way for large&#8208;scale, multi&#8208;scenario applications.

         <title>Minimizing Inter&#8208;Lattice Strain to Stabilize Li&#8208;Rich Cathode by Order&#8211;Disorder Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An order&#8211;disorder coherent design in Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered cathode enables homogeneous structural evolution during charge&#8211;discharge, minimizing lattice strain and suppressing structural degradation, leading to enhanced cycling stability with negligible voltage decay.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered (LMR) cathodes with anionic redox chemistry show great potential for next&#8208;generation sustainable Li&#8208;ion battery (LIB) applications due to the low cost and high energy density. However, the asynchronous structural evolutions with cycling in the heterogeneous composite structure of LMR lead to serious lattice strain and thus fast electrochemical decay, which hinders the commercialization of LMR cathodes. Here, an order&#8211;disorder coherent LMR cathode is demonstrated that exhibits a higher average voltage (by 0.25&#160;V), negligible voltage decay (97.6% voltage retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1), and enhanced cycling stability (98% capacity retention after 200 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) compared to its layered oxide counterparts. It is proposed that this order&#8211;disorder coherent structure design can promote a more synchronous and homogeneous structure evolution during charge and discharge, thus minimizing lattice strain, which significantly prevents layer collapse and collective degradation at high voltage, improving the electrochemical stability. The study displays the feasibility of optimizing the performance of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials through a dedicated order&#8211;disorder structure control for sustainable energy storage.

         <title>Sonicated Carbon Nanotube Catalysts for Efficient Point&#8208;of&#8208;use Water Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growing demand for freshwater and rising contamination of water sources require innovative treatment technologies. Sonicated carbon nanotubes can activate persulfate for selective contaminant degradation via nonradical pathways. This scalable approach enables rapid pollutant removal, offering a sustainable solution for decentralized freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The rising demand for freshwater and increasing contamination of distributed water sources, such as stormwater and surface water, necessitate innovative point&#8208;of&#8208;use treatment technologies. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) using solid oxidants offer a promising approach for decentralized freshwater production but are often limited by nonselective radical reactions that degrade both pollutants and background water constituents. Here, sonicated carbon nanotubes (CNTs) that efficiently activate peroxymonosulfate are demonstrated, enabling selective contaminant degradation via dual nonradical pathways&#8212;singlet oxygen oxidation and direct electron transfer. Optimized sonication introduces catalytically active carbonyl (C&#9552;O) groups on CNT surfaces while preserving their graphitic structure, ensuring rapid electron transfer. This approach achieves 2,4&#8208;dichlorophenol removal, a common industrial and municipal pollutant, within 5&#160;min at a record removal rate of 4.80&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Furthermore, scalable CNT catalyst synthesis and integration into flat membrane and hollow fiber filtration devices, ensuring long&#8208;term stability and efficient pollutant removal in natural river water, are demonstrated. By advancing selective CNT catalysts for AOPs, this work offers a scalable, sustainable solution for point&#8208;of&#8208;use freshwater production in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Cell Atlas&#8208;Inspired Hitchhiking Therapeutic Strategy for Acute Pancreatitis by Restricting ROS in Neutrophils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study discloses the first comprehensive single&#8208;cell differentiation atlas of neutrophils during acute pancreatitis. A neutrophil&#8208;targeted nanoreactor is developed to regulate neutrophil polarization by restricting intracellular reactive oxygen species levels. This strategy effectively alleviates inflammation, offering new mechanistic insights and potential therapeutic avenues for the treatment of acute pancreatitis.








Abstract
Neutrophils can undergo transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming in disease, thus causing inflammation or modulating tissue repair and fibrosis. A thorough understanding of the neutrophil subpopulation composition and their polarization processes in acute pancreatitis (AP) is essential to open up design of treatments tailored to individual patients. Herein, this study distinct subgroups and two differentiation pathways associated with N1 and N2 polarization during AP by single&#8208;cell sequencing. Inspired by this, a hollow manganese dioxide (HMnO2)&#8208;based nanoreactor (Pyp@APHM) conjugated with neutrophil&#8208;binding Ly&#8208;6G antibody and loaded with porphyrin is developed for targeted and in situ modulation of neutrophil polarization. Pyp@APHM can enrich the AP site by hitchhiking on neutrophils and then degrade in response to a weakly acidic environment to simultaneously release manganese ions and porphyrin ligands, enabling in situ synthesis of manganese porphyrin antioxidants. Leveraging this strategy, Pyp@APHM can effectively eliminate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and broadly inhibit both N1 and N2 polarization, as well as enhance tissue oxygenation by generating O2, thereby further mitigating pancreatic inflammation. This study provides a comprehensive single&#8208;cell atlas of neutrophils in AP and proposes an innovative hitchhiking therapeutic strategy for AP by restricting ROS in neutrophils.

         <title>Engineering Bacterial Secretion Systems for Enhanced Tumor Imaging and Surgical Guidance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel contrast agent platform, Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS), for fluorescence image guided surgery. SAS selectively colonizes tumors and secretes streptavidin, enabling precise delineation of invasive tumor margins with prolonged signal retention. The platform demonstrates robust&#160;imaging performance across various tumor types, offering strong potential for clinical translation.








Abstract
Current imaging techniques suffer from a lack of specificity and resolution, leading to inaccurate tumor imaging and limited applicability of targeted contrast agents, as they require cancer&#8208;specific development. The need for enhanced contrast through improved tumor&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (TBR) and the toxicity from repeated injections due to fading fluorescent signals further complicate the issue. Additionally, challenges in visualizing the entire 3D tumor with surface&#8208;stained contrast agents highlight the demand for advanced imaging solutions for more precise surgical guidance. A novel approach is proposed utilizing Streptavidin Associated Salmonella (SAS) as a contrast agent for image&#8208;guided surgeries. SAS selectively proliferates in cancerous tissues and secretes streptavidin upon induction, enabling the binding of subsequently injected biotin&#8208;conjugated fluorescent dyes. This approach enhances tumor visualization with a TBR of up to 15.3, far surpassing conventional agents (TBR &#8764; 2), while enabling prolonged 3&#8208;day imaging, deep tumor penetration, and precise invasive margin delineation with a single contrast agent injection. Furthermore, biosafety evaluations confirmed efficient bacterial clearance, absence of systemic toxicity, and stable physiological responses, supporting its potential for safe clinical translation. This innovative method offers substantial improvements over existing fluorescent contrast agents and holds promise for both diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer&#160;surgery.

         <title>Flexible Selenium Nanowires with Tuneable Electronic Bandgaps</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotubes serve as effective test tubes for selenium nanowires, as their diameter precisely controls the width of the nanowires and the Se&#9472;Se bonding, resulting in a variety of different structures. An electron beam can be used to modify the nanotubes, allowing real&#8208;time observation of the nanowire extrusion process. Additionally, optically transparent boron nitride nanotubes enable direct bandgap measurements for individual nanowires, revealing the interplay between various phenomena occurring at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Manipulating semiconductor properties without altering their chemical composition holds promise for electronic and optical materials. However, linking atomic positions in nanomaterials to their functional properties is challenging due to their polydispersity. This study utilizes nano test tubes to uncover distinct phases of selenium, an elemental semiconductor, demonstrating a remarkable structural plasticity between 0.4 and 3.0 nm. These structures are correlated with their electronic bandgaps, ranging from 2.2 to 2.5 eV, using ultra&#8208;low&#8208;loss electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy for individual nanowires in boron nitride nanotubes (BNNT). Notably, the variation in bandgaps diverges from that of bulk selenium and is non&#8208;monotonic on the host&#8208;nanotube diameter, indicating that conformational distortions in selenium chains begin counteracting quantum confinement effects at sub&#8208;nm scales. A 1D phase diagram predicting selenium's atomic structure based on nanotube diameter, regardless of the chemistry of the host nanotube is developed, which can be BNNT or carbon nanotubes. Phase changes in selenium nanowires are imaged in real&#8208;time by transmission electron microscopy using BNNT as a test tube with an adjustable diameter. These nanoscale findings pave the way for the development of advanced miniature tuneable and flexible electronic components, including transistors, optical sensors, and photovoltaics.

         <title>Hybridizing Electrode Interface Structures in Protonic Ceramic Cells for Durable, Reversible Hydrogen and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid oxygen electrode combining PrOx nanoparticles with a PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone significantly boosts PCEC performance, achieving a current density of 2.25&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;2 at 1.30&#160;V in electrolysis mode and a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. This approach enhances catalytic activity and stability, advancing scalable solutions for clean energy conversion.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton&#8208;conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi0.7Co0.3O3&#8211;&#948; (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich praseodymium oxide (PrOx) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrOx introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the d&#8208;band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm&#8722;2 at 600 &#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 &#937; cm2). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.

&lt;/i&gt; nanoparticles with a PrNi&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (PNC) backbone significantly boosts PCEC performance, achieving a current density of 2.25&#160;A&#160;cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.30&#160;V in electrolysis mode and a Faradaic efficiency of 96.8%. This approach enhances catalytic activity and stability, advancing scalable solutions for clean energy conversion.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) represent a transformative technology for sustainable hydrogen production and power generation by converting energy between chemical and electrical forms. Operating at intermediate temperatures, PCECs utilize proton-conducting electrolytes, achieving high efficiency and reduced degradation. However, a major bottleneck lies at the oxygen electrode due to sluggish kinetics and limited active sites. To address this, we present a hybrid oxygen electrode featuring PrNi&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&#8211;&#948;&lt;/sub&gt; (PNC) backbone infused with oxygen vacancy-rich praseodymium oxide (PrO&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;) nanoparticles. This design leverages the interplay between surface and bulk properties to enhance oxygen adsorption, diffusion, and catalytic kinetics. The PrO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;
      &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
   &lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; introduces abundant oxygen vacancies and modulates the &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center for optimal adsorption energy, while the PNC backbone provides robust proton conduction and stabilizes reaction intermediates. Cells incorporating this hybrid electrode demonstrate a peak power density of 1.56 W cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 600 &#176;C in fuel cell mode and a current density of 2.25 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.30 V in electrolysis mode. Faradaic and energy efficiency reach 96.8% and 89.9%, respectively, with exceptional thermal cycling stability and reduced polarization resistance (0.079 &#937; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This study underscores the potential of advanced electrode architectures to enhance the efficiency, durability, and applicability of PCECs in renewable energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Selective Electrosynthesis of Methanol from CO2 Over Cu/Cu2P2O7 Via the Formate Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalyst delivers over 50% Faradaic efficiency and &gt;100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for methanol electrosynthesis from CO2. The synergy between Cu (111) facets and Cu2P2O7 promotes HCOOH&#8208;mediated pathways, offering a scalable route for sustainable liquid fuel production.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) to methanol offers an eco&#8208;friendly approach to reducing carbon emissions while producing versatile liquid fuels and feedstocks. However, achieving high selectivity for methanol, especially at high current densities, remains challenging due to competing reactions that favor methane and hydrogen formation. Here, the tailored synthesis of Cu/Cu2P2O7&#8208;based hybrid catalysts is reported for efficient and selective methanol production through the discharge of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The catalyst exhibits a Faradaic efficiency exceeding 50% in both H&#8208;cells and gas&#8208;diffusion electrode cells, achieving one of the highest reported methanol partial current densities of over 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Experimental and computational analyses reveal a synergistic effect between Cu nanoparticles with a predominant (111) surface and Cu2P2O7 nanoparticles, which enhances selective methanol production via the HCOOH intermediate pathway. These findings provide insights into designing cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts for selective methanol production.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Photoactive Ferroelectric Semiconductor Incorporating Aromatic Dynamic Spacer Enables Optoelectronic Synaptic Plasticity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#8220;pendulum&#8208;like&#8221; motions of aromatic cations are customized in the 2D constrained environments to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics with unique photo&#8208;ferroelectric coupling effects, which enables the construction of heterojunction phototransistors with superior optoelectronic synaptic plasticity.








Abstract
Photoferroelectrics are capturing the growing interest for their unique light&#8208;polarization coupling and optoelectronic applicability. However, the formidable challenge persists in coupling electric order and strong photoactivity through precise molecular design, hindering their further application in the field of optoelectronic memory. Herein, the molecular dynamics of aromatic cations in the 2D constrained environments are customized to construct perovskite photoferroelectrics, (4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylbenzylammonium)2(ethylammonium)2Pb3I10, showing a narrow bandgap (&#8776;1.96&#160;eV) and strong visible&#8208;photosensitivity. Notably, multi&#8208;level dynamic states of aromatic cations provide the impetus for inducing ferroelectric order and photo&#8208;ferroelectric effects. Such captivating characteristics can achieve light&#8208;induced multiple polarization, dielectric, and conductivity states. Accordingly, photoferroelectrics are integrated into heterojunction phototransistors that display robust electrical and optical modulation, including diversified synaptic plasticity with low optical program power (&#8776;20 pJ) for each training process. As a noteworthy advancement in the photoferroelectric field, this work will enrich the understanding of the structure&#8208;property relationship and shed light on further exploration toward neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Bionic Triboelectric Nanogenerator Activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; Cascade Effect In Situ to Accelerate Critical&#8208;Sized Bone Defect Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bionic PPCs&#8208;TENG accelerates CSBD repair through the activation of a &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect. It generates bio&#8208;ES that dynamically responds to the host's mechanical state, exhibiting a resting membrane potential during static conditions and generating action potentials upon mechanical deformation. This bio&#8208;ES activates both extracellular and intracellular biochemical factors, leading to enhanced osteogenic differentiation and angiogenic processes in CSBDs.








Abstract
The loss of the intrinsic &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in critical&#8208;sized bone defects (CSBDs) impedes the bone self&#8208;healing process. Traditional strategies cannot provide bionic electrical output, thereby failing to sufficiently activate the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect in situ and limiting the repair efficiency of CSBDs. Here, a bionic, self&#8208;adhesive, and biodegradable triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) called PPCs&#8208;TENG using silk&#8208;fibroin&#8208;derived peptide (Cs)&#8208;grafted polydopamine&#8211;polyacrylamide (PPCs) as the electrode layer is fabricated. It provides bionic electrical stimulation (bio&#8208;ES) in response to the host's motion status. It reestablishes the resting potential during host rest and generates real&#8208;time biofeedback action potential during host movement. Further, it activates the &#8220;mechano&#8208;electro&#8208;biochemical&#8221; cascade effect for accelerating the repair of CSBDs. The bio&#8208;ES generated from PPCs&#8208;TENG enriches extracellular osteogenesis&#8208;related biochemical factors at the CSBD site. It also activates the intracellular mechanosensitive protein Piezo1, thereby promoting calcium signaling and intracellular mechano&#8208;transduction pathways. This activation enhances the proliferation and migration of bone marrow stem cells (BMSCs) and human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), and promotes osteogenic differentiation in BMSCs and angiogenesis in HUVECs. In vivo tests demonstrate that PPCs&#8208;TENG significantly accelerates the repair of CSBDs in situ.

         <title>Semipermeable Membrane&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Bonding Interface for Fabricating High&#8208;Performance Pure PEDOT:PSS Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly conductive flexible pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogel is developed inspired by the control of hierarchical phase separation, which is driven by the formation of dialysis&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interaction interface. The obtained hydrogel enables multi&#8208;scenario bioelectronic applications, including neural signals monitoring/stimulation within epileptic rats, human&#8208;machine interactions, and multimodal signal decoupling.








Abstract
Conductive poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrene sulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) hydrogels are potential bioelectronic interface materials because of their favorable mechanical properties and tunable electrochemical performances. Owing to intrinsic core&#8208;shell colloidal microstructure composed of insulative phase and conductive phase, inducing phase separation via diverse methods are proposed to improve their performances. However, fabrication of high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via a simple, mild strategy remains challenges. Here, we report a straightforward strategy to yield high&#8208;performance pure PEDOT:PSS hydrogels via the formation of semipermeable membrane&#8208;mediated hydrogen bonding interface. In this method, ethanol&#8208;attracted PSS is free to accumulate at the man&#8208;made interface provided by the semipermeable membrane, to realize controllable hierarchical PEDOT and PSS two&#8208;phase distribution. The separated PEDOT aggregates via &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugation, followed by the removal of rearranged insulative PSS phase easily, to form PEDOT:PSS hydrogels with satisfactory mechanical and electrochemical performances. This work presents a universal, effective, and controlled strategy to design conductive hydrogels for bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Targeted Delivery of Biomimetic Bacterial Outer Membrane Nanoparticles for Enhanced Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
BM&#8208;NPs provide a dynamic and spatiotemporally targeted solution for post&#8208;spinal cord injury challenges. By mitigating foam cell formation, regulating inflammation, enhancing autophagy, and promoting cholesterol efflux, BM&#8208;NPs effectively preserve myelin integrity, reshape the inflammatory microenvironment, and facilitate neural function recovery. This versatile platform offers innovative potential for addressing the complexities of spinal cord injury treatment.








Abstract
Spinal cord injury (SCI) is a complex and dynamic pathological condition characterized by disrupted lipid metabolism and neuroinflammatory responses, posing significant therapeutic challenges. To address these, biomimetic bacterial outer membrane nanoparticles (BM&#8208;NPs) are designed by integrating the precise targeting capability of detoxified outer membrane vesicles (dOMVs) with the efficient drug&#8208;loading properties of liposomes. BM&#8208;NPs exhibit superior targeting efficiency toward peripheral neutrophils and macrophages, enabling spatiotemporal drug delivery via immune cells. An innovative &#8220;Tortoise and Hare&#8221; dynamic adaptive delivery strategy is introduced, where neutrophils facilitate rapid drug transport during the acute phase of SCI, while macrophages ensure sustained delivery during the subacute phase. This strategy aligns with the dynamic pathological progression of SCI, offering precision targeting tailored to different stages of injury. BM&#8208;NPs demonstrate multifaceted therapeutic effects, including the suppression of foam cell formation through coordinated enhancement of lipid droplet autophagy and cholesterol efflux. Furthermore, they modulate the inflammatory microenvironment, preserve myelin integrity, and significantly promote neural functional recovery post&#8208;SCI. By overcoming the limitations of conventional delivery systems in targeting and timeliness, BM&#8208;NPs offer an innovative, highly efficient, and clinically translatable platform for SCI treatment and other acute inflammatory disorders of the central nervous system.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Mediated Preservation of Live Tumor Explants for Drug Development in Peritoneal Metastases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a hyaluronan&#8208;based hydrogel&#160;platform preserving the native tumor microenvironment (morphology, tissue composition, histology) of patient&#8208;derived explants from peritoneal metastases, enabling clinically relevant drug screening. Hydrogel properties such as stiffness and degradation are crucial for longer&#8208;term histoculture. This study also reveals for the first time, a universal finding that hydrogels perturb myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction in embedded tissues, thereby enhancing explant preservation.








Abstract
Clinically effective treatments for peritoneal metastases (PM) remain a significant unmet need. To expedite drug development in PM, hyaluronan (HA) hydrogel&#8208;supported PM patient&#8208;derived tumor explants (PDTE) that better preserve histological features, composition, and biological pathways of the original tumor, as compared to conventional PDTE culture methods are developed. Hydrogel modulation shows that stiffness, degradation, three&#8208;dimensional embedding, and HA itself are key parameters that enhance PDTE maintenance ex vivo. Further, HA hydrogels effectively preserve PDTE viability by disrupting myosin II&#8208;mediated tissue contraction, a phenomenon that occurs in the absence of hydrogel embedding. Lastly, the addition of ascites into PM PDTE not only recapitulates changes to the tumor microenvironment as observed in patients but also ascites&#8208;dependent drug efficacy, highlighting the importance of incorporating ascites into ex vivo PM models for accurate therapeutic evaluation. The bioengineered PM PDTE models in this study serve as a valuable platform for drug development and treatment personalization.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Controlled Solution Flow via Patterned Meniscus Assist for Elongated Exciton Diffusion Length to Approaching 20% Efficiency in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Patterned meniscus assisted sequential blade&#8208;coated strategy is applied in fabricating pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic solar cells, which can stretch polymer chains and facilitate donor/acceptor inter&#8208;penetration to extend exciton diffusion length (from &#8776;45 to &#8776;56 nm) and mitigate Marangoni flow to promote film uniformity by improving solution flow, thus achieving champion efficiency of 19.91% (certified as 19.63%) with one of the minimum efficiency losses during area expansion.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the ideal vertical phase morphology of blade&#8208;coated pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) organic photovoltaics presents a key challenge due to Marangoni flow and coffee&#8208;ring effect, which further limits large&#8208;area film uniformity and shortens exciton diffusion length. Here, the patterned meniscus assist (PMA) strategy is used to stretch polymer chains and construct regular micropatterns to facilitate donor/acceptor inter&#8208;penetration, resulting in a high&#8208;performance printable PPHJ device with extended exciton diffusion length (from &#8776;45 to &#8776;56&#160;nm). More importantly, micropatterns can mitigate Marangoni flow and promote film uniformity by enhancing solution flow. Consequently, the PPHJ device via PMA strategy exhibits one of the highest power conversion efficiencies (PCE) of 19.91% (certified as 19.63%) for the D18/BO&#8208;4Cl:L8&#8208;BO ternary system. Furthermore, the enlarged&#8208;area (1 and 16.94 cm2) devices show competitive PCEs of 18.90%/17.05% with one of the minimum PCE losses (5.07%/14.36%) during area expansion. This PMA strategy provides a feasible guiding avenue for realizing ideal active layer morphology to obtain large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;efficiency PPHJ devices.

         <title>Synthesis of Ultrathin Mesoporous CuxRu Nanomeshes for Efficient Kilowatt&#8208;Level Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the guidance of theoretical calculations, a mesoporous CuxRu nanomesh structure is synthesized, with a thickness of 2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution ranging from 2 to 10&#160;nm. An anion exchange membrane electrolyzer assembled with this catalyst demonstrates kilowatt&#8208;level nitrate reduction performance.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of abundant nitrate ions from industrial wastewater and polluted groundwater into value&#8208;added ammonia represents an important route for the sustainable development of human society. However, developing efficient and stable catalysts remains a huge challenge. Herein, the synthesis of ultrathin mesoporous CuxRu nanomeshes is reported via a theory&#8208;guided ion exchange method for efficient nitrate reduction to ammonia. The prepared CuxRu nanomeshes are composed of Cu atoms anchored ultrathin mesoporous Ru nanomeshes, with a thickness of &#8776;2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution between 2 and 10&#160;nm. It offers a high nitrate reduction performance, including a positive onset potential (0.41&#160;V), a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (94.5%) and a highest ammonia mass activity (0.7 A mg&#8722;1) at 0&#160;V up to date. Moreover, a kilowatt&#8208;level nitrate reduction is first verified in a flow electrolyzer, with the fastest reported NO3&#8722; removal velocity of 12.4&#160;mmol min&#8722;1. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that Cu atoms can balance the energy barriers in nitrate reduction and competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance.

The prepared Cu&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;Ru nanomeshes are composed of Cu atoms anchored ultrathin mesoporous Ru nanomeshes, with a thickness of &#8776;2&#8211;3&#160;nm and a pore distribution between 2 and 10&#160;nm. It offers a high nitrate reduction performance, including a positive onset potential (0.41&#160;V), a high ammonia Faradaic efficiency (94.5%) and a highest ammonia mass activity (0.7 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at 0&#160;V up to date. Moreover, a kilowatt-level nitrate reduction is first verified in a flow electrolyzer, with the fastest reported NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; removal velocity of 12.4&#160;mmol min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations clearly reveal that Cu atoms can balance the energy barriers in nitrate reduction and competitive hydrogen evolution reactions, leading to improved catalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>P&#8208;Band Center Engineering of Sulfur to Weaken Fe&#9472;S Bond Toward Superior Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique v&#8208;FeS2@C composite is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits record&#8208;breaking rate capability and long&#8208;life cycle performance. The sodium&#8208;ion full cell delivers the best specific capacity and long cyclic stability, much more superior to that of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based sulfides are appealing anodes of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to the high theoretical capacity, low&#8208;cost, and excellent mechanical/thermal stability. However, achieving high electrochemical performances in such anodes is hindered by the strong Fe&#9472;S bonds and sluggish kinetics. Here, a unique carbon&#8208;coated iron sulfide composite with abundant S vacancies (v&#8208;FeS2@C) is designed, the spin polarization and S vacancy lift the p&#8208;band center (&#603;
p) of S and then decouple it from the d&#8208;band center (&#603;d) of Fe, which weakens Fe&#9472;S bond and strengthens Na&#9472;S interaction. The obtained v&#8208;FeS2@C anode exhibits ultrahigh rate capability of 438.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 70 A g&#8722;1 and remarkable long&#8208;life cycle performance (512.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 8000 cycles at 40 A g&#8722;1). Particularly, the sodium&#8208;ion full cell composed of v&#8208;FeS2@C anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode delivers the best specific capacity (211.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 40 A g&#8722;1) and long cyclic stability (459.5 mAh g&#8722;1 after 2000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1). Such performances are much more superior to those of the other iron&#8208;based sulfides. This work provides a new paradigm for boosting SIBs' performances of iron&#8208;based sulfides by regulating p&#8208;band center (&#603;p) of S and weakening Fe&#9472;S bonds.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering of Amphiphilic Peptides Nanofibrous Crosslinkers toward Mechanically Robust, Functionally Customable, and Sustainable Supramolecular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported for constructing mechanically robust yet structurally dynamic hydrogels through the integration of amphiphilic peptide nanofibers as multifunctional supramolecular crosslinkers. The synergistic combination of molecular amphiphilicity and sequence&#8208;programmable design enables precise customization of hydrogel functionality, while the fully dynamic supramolecular network facilitates efficient material recycling and reprocessing for sustainable environmental practices.








Abstract
Hierarchical architectures spanning multiple length scales are ubiquitous in biological tissues, conferring them with both mechanical robustness and dynamic functionalities via structural reorganization under loads. The design of hierarchical architectures within synthetic hydrogels to concurrently achieve mechanical reinforcement and functional integration remains challenging. Here, a biomimetic hierarchical engineering approach is reported to develop mechanically robust and function&#8208;customizable supramolecular hydrogels by utilizing strong yet dynamic fibrous nanoarchitectures of amphiphilic peptides as crosslinkers. This design, on one hand, resolves the strength&#8208;toughness trade&#8208;off in hydrogel design through energy&#8208;dissipative mechanisms involving dynamic detachment and reinsertion of peptides within their assembled nanostructures upon loading. On the other hand, the amphiphilicity and sequence programmability of peptides allow spatially orthogonal integration of multiple dynamic functionalities across distinct structural domains, including lipophilic fluorophore encapsulation, photopatterning capability, and anisotropic contraction. Capitalizing on its ultralow hysteresis and rapid recovery properties, the hydrogel's effectiveness is demonstrated as high&#8208;sensitivity strain sensors. Moreover, the fully noncovalent crosslinking strategy permits closed&#8208;loop recycling and reprocessing via reversible crosslinker disassembly&#8208;reassembly processes. Through systematic extension of this principle across diverse peptide systems, a generalized platform is demonstrated for creating advanced soft materials that synergistically integrate traditionally incompatible attributes of mechanical robustness, customable dynamic functionality, and environmental sustainability.

         <title>Programmable Wire Metamaterials for Visible and Self&#8208;Adaptive Infrared Camouflage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable metamaterial&#8208;based camouflage system is developed to seamlessly blend objects into their surroundings, not only hiding them from the human eye but also automatically adapting to thermal environments without human intervention. It provides effective concealment throughout day and night cycles, across diverse terrains like deserts, forests, and roads. This innovative approach advances diverse self&#8208;adaptive materials design.








Abstract
Adaptive infrared (IR) radiation management that can autonomously adjust IR radiation on demand while maintaining independent visible compatibility has been long pursued for practical applications, such as camouflage. Here, an integrated programmable wire metamaterial is developed that enables programmable autonomy and dual&#8208;band compatibility for non&#8208;interference visible and self&#8208;adaptive IR camouflage. This system allows automatic and intelligent concealment of targets in complex and dynamic thermal environments without human intervention. The self&#8208;adaptive IR camouflage is facilitated by the manipulation of the metamaterial's tilt angle for continuous tunability of emissivity, which is attributed to the tilt angle&#8208;dependent broadband impedance matching mechanisms. Equipped with programmable feedback algorithm commands, the integrated system dynamically adapts to varying thermal backgrounds, achieving apparent temperature modulation of up to 27&#160;&#176;C (ranging from 14 to 41&#160;&#176;C) while minimizing thermal imaging contrast to within 1&#160;&#176;C. These capabilities ensure that the target remains undetected by both visible and thermal detectors throughout the day. This work opens up new opportunities for the next&#8208;generation multispectral camouflage technologies and advances in spatiotemporal and programmable self&#8208;adaptive systems.

         <title>A Bionic Textile Sensory System for Humanoid Robots Capable of Intelligent Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bionic pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is designed and fabricated by mimicking slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors. The PT sensor realizes the function of both SA and FA receptors based on a piezoresistive principle in a single sensor, and an artificial sensory system is constructed for real&#8208;time high&#8208;accuracy surface texture recognition.








Abstract
Artificial tactile perception systems that emulate the functions of slow adaptive (SA) and fast adaptive (FA) cutaneous mechanoreceptors are essential for developing advanced prosthetics and humanoid robots. However, constructing a high&#8208;performance sensory system within a single device capable of simultaneously perceiving both static and dynamic forces for surface&#8208;texture recognition remains a critical challenge; this contrasts with common strategies integrating individual SA&#8208; and FA&#8208;mimicking sensors in multi&#8208;layered, multi&#8208;circuit configurations. Herein, a textile pressure/tactile (PT) sensor is reported based solely on piezoresistive principle alongside high sensitivity and rapid response to both high&#8208;frequency vibrations and static forces. These characteristics are attributed to the sensor's 3D multiscale architecture and the corresponding hierarchical structural deformation of its honeycomb&#8208;like sensing fabric. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application relevant to humanoid robotics and prosthetics, an automated surface&#8208;texture&#8208;recognition system is constructed by integrating the PT sensor with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a prosthetic device, an industrial robot arm, and a graphical user interface. This artificial sensory system demonstrates the ability to learn distinct object features, differentiate fine surface textures, and subsequently classify unknown textiles with high recognition accuracy (&gt;98.9%) across a wide range of scanning speeds (50&#8211;300&#160;mm s&#8722;1). These results show promise for the future development of interactive artificial intelligence.

         <title>Ligand Field&#8208;Induced Dual Active Sites Enhance Redox Potential of Nickel Hexacyanoferrate for Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work aims to explore the electrochemical performance and energy storage mechanism of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF) in ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). The effect of ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites has been revealed for the first time. Ni atoms of NiHCF display electrochemical activity in AIBs. Additionally, Ni can balance the charge distribution and further enhance the redox potential.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox potential of cathode materials is vital for increasing the energy density of aqueous ammonium ion batteries (AIBs). Prussian blue analogues (PBAs), with their inherently high redox potentials and open frameworks, are promising candidates. However, further boosting their redox potential and understanding their NH4+ ion storage mechanisms remain critical challenges. In this work, a novel ligand field&#8208;induced dual active sites mechanism is introduced by incorporating Ni into the PBA framework, activating Ni as an additional redox center for NH4+ ion storage. The electron transfer from Ni to Fe within the Ni&#9472;N&#8801;C&#9472;Fe chain enhances the redox potential and electrochemical performance of nickel hexacyanoferrate (NiHCF). For the first time, the electrochemical activity of Ni is demonstrated in NiHCF during NH4+ ions intercalation and de&#8208;intercalation. NiHCF exhibits elevated redox potentials, superior rate performance, and robust cycling stability compared to iron hexacyanoferrate (FeHCF). Advanced characterization techniques and density functional theory calculations confirm the activation of Ni and the enhanced interaction between NH4+ ions and the framework. These findings provide new insights into the NH4+ ion storage mechanism of PBAs and offer a promising strategy for designing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathode materials for AIBs.

         <title>Bismuthene Under Cover: Graphene Intercalation of a Large Gap Quantum Spin Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuthene, a quantum spin Hall insulator with a massive 800 meV topological gap, holds great potential for room&#8208;temperature devices but rapidly degrades in air. This study demonstrates that intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a graphene sheet preserves its structure and topology while preventing oxidation, enabling ex&#8208;situ experiments and advancing the fabrication of bismuthene&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
The quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene, a two&#8208;third monolayer of bismuth on SiC(0001), is distinguished by helical metallic edge states that are protected by a groundbreaking 800 meV topological gap, making it ideal for room temperature applications. This massive gap inversion arises from a unique synergy between flat honeycomb structure, strong spin orbit coupling, and an orbital filtering effect that is mediated by the substrate. However, the rapid oxidation of bismuthene in air has severely hindered the development of applications, so far confining experiments to ultra&#8208;high vacuum conditions. Intercalating bismuthene between SiC and a protective sheet of graphene, this barrier is successfully overcome. As demonstrated by scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy, graphene intercalation preserves the structural and topological integrity of bismuthene, while effectively shielding it from oxidation in air. Hereby, hydrogen is identified as the critical process gas that was&#160;missing in previous bismuth intercalation attempts. These findings facilitate ex&#8208;situ experiments and pave the way for the development of bismuthene based devices, signaling a significant step forward in the development of next&#8208;generation&#160;technologies.

         <title>A Relay&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Macrocyclic Host&#8211;Guest System for Selective Isomer Adsorption, Controlled Release, and Turn&#8208;On Colorimetric Sensing of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;Bromoalkanes</title>

         <dc:description>
A macrocycle&#8208;based multifunctional solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest system is constructed for selective adsorption and separation of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;bromoalkane isomers, controlled release at room temperature, and colorimetric sensing. Utilizing a competitive binding strategy, the system enables dynamic guest exchange and donor&#8211;acceptor assembly, offering new insights into stimuli&#8208;responsive supramolecular crystalline materials and advanced molecular separation technologies.








Abstract
Macrocycle&#8208;based adaptive crystals have gained significant attention for their precise adsorption and separation capabilities. However, achieving controlled analyte release under nonthermal stimuli remains a major challenge. Here, a relay&#8208;type solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest system based on a fluorinated pillararene derivative, EtFLP6, is presented, which enables selective adsorption of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;bromoalkane isomers, room&#8208;temperature&#8208;controlled desorption, and turn&#8208;on colorimetric sensing. Activated EtFLP6 crystals selectively adsorb 1&#8208;bromoalkanes from mixtures of 1&#8208;/2&#8208;positional isomers and release them at room temperature upon introduction of electron&#8208;deficient aromatic acceptors (4&#8208;nitrobenzonitrile and 1,5&#8208;difluoro&#8208;2,4&#8208;dinitrobenzene), triggering a distinct color change from colorless to orange. Single&#8208;crystal structures incorporating X&#8208;ray powder diffraction and spectral analyses reveal that the desorption and color change result from the disassembly of solid&#8208;state host&#8211;guest complexes, driven by competitive binding with acceptors. This process is governed by the dynamic intermolecular interactions and selective molecular recognition of EtFLP6 in the solid state. This work bridges traditional macrocyclic adsorbents with functional organic cocrystals, offering a novel strategy for designing intelligent supramolecular materials.

         <title>Guideline of Dynamic Tunnel Structural Evolution for Durable Sodium&#8208;Ion Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunnel&#8208;type Na0.44MnO2 cathode dynamically evolves into different crystal structures upon Mn substitution by other elements, a process that can be rationally regulated to achieve both high capacity and high stability. This study addresses a critical challenge in the development of sodium&#8208;ion oxide cathodes by elucidating the design principles governing their dynamic tunnel structural evolution.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes hold great promise for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their cost&#8208;effectiveness and environmental compatibility. In this study, using tunnel&#8208;type Na0.44MnO2 as a prototype, a systematic investigation is conducted to examine how different element substitutions affect structural evolution and found that these element substitutions alter the total energy of the pristine system, driving the structure to evolve gradually from a tunnel to a different crystal configuration. Notably, using advanced scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the transition zone is captured from tunnel to layered structure for the first time, providing direct evidence of phase evolution. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Mg substitution uniquely facilitates the formation of layered/spinel heterostructures, enabling intimate interfacial integration that reduces Na&#8314; transport barriers and enhances structural integrity. COMSOL simulations further demonstrate that the layered/spinel configuration effectively mitigates stress accumulation, achieving high rate and long cycle performance. These findings provide comprehensive design principles of dynamic tunnel structural evolution of Mn&#8208;based oxide cathodes, thereby advancing the design of high&#8208;performance SIBs.

         <title>Co&#8208;Implementing Optimized Volmer and Heyrovsky Reactions in Hydrogen Production via Composite Active Sites on Electron&#8208;Withdrawing Carriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comprehensive optimization of both Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction has been achieved by the synergistic catalysis of composite active sites combined Pt single&#8208;atoms with Pt nanoclusters on an electron&#8208;withdrawing defective boron nitride carrier, which results in superior intrinsic activity with an impressive turnover frequency and a remarkable long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
The trade&#8208;off of the Volmer reaction for *H formation and the Heyrovsky/Tafel Reaction for *H desorption is a crucial challenge in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, aside from the conventional construction of bifunctional active sites to accelerate the water dissociation step, the electronic retrimming of each metal site is also non&#8208;negligible. Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst combining Pt single&#8208;atoms and Pt nanoparticles on the etched boron nitride (eBN) coated carbon nanotube (Pt&#8208;eBN@CNT) is synthesized, where both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps are promoted by the synergistic adsorption of the composite active sites and the electron&#8208;withdrawing effect of eBN carrier, respectively. The proposed catalyst shows impressive performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 25.1&#160;&#177; 1.7 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a TOF of 17.1 &#177; 1.3 s&#8722;1 at 0.15 V vs RHE under extremely low metal loading of 6 &#181;gPt&#160;cm&#8722;2 (catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly better than those for the commercial benchmark Pt/C (44.2 &#177; 4.1 mV, 0.9 &#177; 0.1 s&#8722;1 at catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&#8722;2; 156.1 &#177; 0.6 mV, 1.6 &#177; 0.1 s&#8722;1 at metal loading of 6 &#181;gPt&#160;cm&#8722;2) under the same conditions. Moreover, a membrane&#8208;electrode&#8208;assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with Pt&#8208;eBN@CNT as the cathodic catalyst exhibits a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) of 2.0 &#215; 106 C&#183;cm&#8722;2 within high&#8208;temperature electrocatalysis at 1.0 A&#183;cm&#8722;2, significantly higher than those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates the important role of active&#8208;site combination coupled with carrier effect in optimizing the kinetics of multi&#8208;step electrocatalytic reaction.

     alt="Co-Implementing Optimized Volmer and Heyrovsky Reactions in Hydrogen Production via Composite Active Sites on Electron-Withdrawing Carriers"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comprehensive optimization of both Volmer and Heyrovsky steps in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction has been achieved by the synergistic catalysis of composite active sites combined Pt single-atoms with Pt nanoclusters on an electron-withdrawing defective boron nitride carrier, which results in superior intrinsic activity with an impressive turnover frequency and a remarkable long-term durability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The trade-off of the Volmer reaction for *H formation and the Heyrovsky/Tafel Reaction for *H desorption is a crucial challenge in alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Thus, aside from the conventional construction of bifunctional active sites to accelerate the water dissociation step, the electronic retrimming of each metal site is also non-negligible. Herein, an efficient HER electrocatalyst combining Pt single-atoms and Pt nanoparticles on the etched boron nitride (eBN) coated carbon nanotube (Pt-eBN@CNT) is synthesized, where both the Volmer and Heyrovsky steps are promoted by the synergistic adsorption of the composite active sites and the electron-withdrawing effect of eBN carrier, respectively. The proposed catalyst shows impressive performance in alkaline media with an overpotential of 25.1&#160;&#177; 1.7 mV at 10 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a TOF of 17.1 &#177; 1.3 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.15 V vs RHE under extremely low metal loading of 6 &#181;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), significantly better than those for the commercial benchmark Pt/C (44.2 &#177; 4.1 mV, 0.9 &#177; 0.1 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at catalyst loading of 0.77 mg&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 156.1 &#177; 0.6 mV, 1.6 &#177; 0.1 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at metal loading of 6 &#181;g&lt;sub&gt;Pt&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under the same conditions. Moreover, a membrane-electrode-assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with Pt-eBN@CNT as the cathodic catalyst exhibits a notable charge transfer amount (stands for a long service life) of 2.0 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; C&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; within high-temperature electrocatalysis at 1.0 A&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, significantly higher than those of state-of-the-art Pt-based electrocatalysts. This work demonstrates the important role of active-site combination coupled with carrier effect in optimizing the kinetics of multi-step electrocatalytic reaction.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reinforced Perovskite&#8208;Substrate Interfaces via Multi&#8208;Sited and Dual&#8208;Sided Anchoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The perovskite&#8208;substrate interfaces are reinforced by using a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole transporter, which enables significantly enhanced interfacial adhesion and defect passivation. The resulting inverted structured perovskite solar cells achieve 26.8% efficiency with excellent operational stability at 85&#160;&#176;C. This work demonstrates the critical role of interfacial stabilization for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Interfacial reliability is critical for the long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface represents the most vulnerable part in high&#8208;efficiency devices. Here, this interface, by incorporating a dual&#8208;sided anchoring polymeric hole&#8208;transporting interlayer is reinforced with abundant coordinating pyridyl units as side chains, which induces strong adhesion between the perovskite and substrate by forming multidimensional interactions with adjacent layers. This simultaneously enhances the mechanical strength through effective distribution and dissipation of mechanical stress and the electronic quality of the perovskite&#8208;substrate interface through defect passivation. The resulting PSCs exhibit a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.8% (certified at 26.6%). With a more robust perovskite composition, devices maintain 98% of their initial PCE of &#8776;26% after maximum&#8208;power&#8208;point tracking at 85&#160;&#176;C for 1500&#160;h. These devices exhibit excellent fatigue resistance under thermal cycling (&#8208;40 to 85&#160;&#176;C), retaining 93% efficiency after undergoing 900 cycles.

Abstract
Despite its high theoretical capacity and the lowest electrode potential, the lithium metal (Li&#176;) anode possesses significant volume changes and narrow external pressure tolerance upon cycling, hindering its commercial applications in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs). Herein, the concept of topology fortified anode (TFA) materials is introduced, featuring a 3D lithiophilic Li5B4 skeleton combined with an ingeniously optimized fraction of electroactive lithium phase, along with broadened external pressure tolerance to synergistically enhance the electrochemical performance of ASSLBs. The unique topological design of the TFA materials empowers them with robust mechanical stability and fast lithium diffusivity, achieving near&#8208;zero volume changes along with a fivefold improvement in external pressure tolerance compared to Li&#176;. An archetypal TFA&#8208;based symmetric cell demonstrates 3.6&#8208;fold higher critical current density than its Li&#176;&#8208;based counterpart, sustaining stable cycling for &gt;6,000&#160;h at 2 mAh cm&#8722;2. When paired with a high&#8208;capacity of FeS2 cathode, the archetypal TFA&#8208;based full cells achieve 62% active lithium utilization (9.5 mAh cm&#8722;2), and &#8776;70% capacity retention after 800 cycles at a high current density of 3.07 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The findings provide a revolutionary design approach for high&#8208;energy anodes in ASSLBs, advancing not only their development but also battery technologies beyond lithium chemistry.

Abstract
Solid&#8208;state Na batteries (SSNBs) are among the most promising next&#8208;generation energy storage devices due to their high energy density, enhanced safety, and cost&#8208;efficiency. Achieving high&#8208;performance SSNBs depends on the development of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) with excellent ionic conductivity, wide electrochemical windows, and robust mechanical properties. Sulfide and halide&#8208;based Na SSEs have been widely studied in recent years with their respective strengths and limitations. Herein for the first time, a new family of Na&#8208;Zr&#8208;S&#8208;Cl sulfide&#8208;chloride Na SSEs with tailored anion compositions is explored. A high ionic conductivity of 4.89 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 is realized with a Cl&#8208;rich structure, attributed to the unique chloride bridging structure and low Na&#8208;ion migration barrier. Furthermore, by tuning the ratio between sulfur and chloride anions, two different unique structures are obtained with different surface morphology, thermal stability, mechanical properties, and electrochemical stability. The Cl&#8208;deficient structure of Na2S&#8208;1.3ZrCl4 SSEs demonstrates excellent stability for solid&#8208;state Na&#8208;ion batteries, maintaining a high reversible capacity of over 90 mAh g&#8722;1 after 600 cycles at 0.1 C. This study offers insights into the design of new Na SSEs, advancing the development of safer and high&#8208;performance SSNBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Spin Cobalt Enables Strong Metal&#8208;Sulfur Orbital Hybridization for Accelerated Polysulfide Conversion in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) for Li&#8208;S batteries is reported, featuring undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets anchoring high&#8208;spin Co atoms. The unpaired 3d electrons of Co promote orbital hybridization with polysulfides, enhancing conversion kinetics, suppressing shuttle effects, and improving cycling stability under practical conditions.








Abstract
The development of electrocatalysts to mitigate polysulfide shuttling and enhance the kinetics of sulfur species conversion is pivotal for the advancement of lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries. In this study, the fabrication of porous, undercoordinated titanium dioxide nanosheets adorned with high&#8208;spin state cobalt atoms (HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x) as efficient electrocatalysts is presented. The undercoordinated TiO2&#8208;x nanosheets provide a profusion of edge active sites conducive to Co atom attachment, firmly embedded within the lattice structure, thereby ensuring heightened structural stability throughout repetitive cycling processes. Furthermore, the high&#8208;spin state Co atoms contribute abundant unpaired electrons, occupying distinct 3d orbitals. This configuration facilitates electron transfer and orbital hybridization upon interaction with polysulfides, leading to suppressed shutting effect and enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics. Consequently, the Li&#8208;S cell equipped with an HSCo/TiO2&#8208;x modified separator exhibits an impressive capacity of 8.05 mAh cm&#8722;2 under elevated sulfur loading of 10.9 mg cm&#8722;2. Additionally, the fabricated Li&#8208;S pouch cell delivers a substantial initial discharge capacity of 0.47 Ah with a high energy density of 379.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. This study serves as a valuable reference for exploring the intricate relationship between spin state regulation and electrochemical performance, and holds great promise for the design of highly efficient future electrocatalysts.

&lt;p&gt;The development of electrocatalysts to mitigate polysulfide shuttling and enhance the kinetics of sulfur species conversion is pivotal for the advancement of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. In this study, the fabrication of porous, undercoordinated titanium dioxide nanosheets adorned with high-spin state cobalt atoms (HSCo/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt;) as efficient electrocatalysts is presented. The undercoordinated TiO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets provide a profusion of edge active sites conducive to Co atom attachment, firmly embedded within the lattice structure, thereby ensuring heightened structural stability throughout repetitive cycling processes. Furthermore, the high-spin state Co atoms contribute abundant unpaired electrons, occupying distinct 3d orbitals. This configuration facilitates electron transfer and orbital hybridization upon interaction with polysulfides, leading to suppressed shutting effect and enhanced polysulfide conversion kinetics. Consequently, the Li-S cell equipped with an HSCo/TiO&lt;sub&gt;2-x&lt;/sub&gt; modified separator exhibits an impressive capacity of 8.05 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; under elevated sulfur loading of 10.9 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Additionally, the fabricated Li-S pouch cell delivers a substantial initial discharge capacity of 0.47 Ah with a high energy density of 379.3 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study serves as a valuable reference for exploring the intricate relationship between spin state regulation and electrochemical performance, and holds great promise for the design of highly efficient future electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Narrowband OLEDs Achieve External Quantum Efficiency Over 40% and Blue Index of 422 by Synergistic &#960;&#8208;Extension and Heavy&#8208;Atom Effect</title>

         <dc:description>
A &#960;&#8208;extended, heavy&#8208;atom design enables multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitters with an ultrafast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 3.0 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 while preserving narrowband emission in the deep&#8208;blue region. The best&#8208;performing device achieves an emission maximum at 456 nm, a full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 18 nm, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 40.5%, and a Blue Index of 422, charting a promising route toward next&#8208;generation deep&#8208;blue display technologies.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters hold great promise for high&#8208;resolution OLEDs, yet achieving both ultranarrow emission and efficient triplet utilization in the deep&#8208;blue region remains challenging. Here, a synergistic molecular design is reported that combines &#960;&#8208;extension and heavy&#8208;atom incorporation to effectively reconcile the trade&#8208;off between color purity and fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC). In this approach, &#960;&#8208;extension narrows the emission bandwidth and reduces the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap, while the strategic introduction of chalcogen atoms selectively enhances spin&#8211;orbit coupling with minimal impact on the emission spectrum. As a result, the new emitter exhibits a peak emission at 453&#160;nm with an exceptionally narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 17&#160;nm and a high RISC rate constant of 3.0 &#215; 106&#8201;s&#8722;1. When incorporated into a non&#8208;sensitized OLED, the emitter meets the European Broadcast Union (EBU) deep&#8208;blue standard with CIE coordinates as low as (0.140,&#8201;0.059), and sustains a brightness exceeding 30,000&#8201;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2. Notably, the device achieves a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 40.5% with minimal roll&#8208;off&#8212;retaining 38.4% and 28.2% at 100 and 1,000&#160;cd&#8201;m&#8722;2, respectively&#8212;and attains a Blue Index (BI) of 422&#160;cd&#8201;A&#8722;1&#8201;CIEy&#8722;1. These findings highlight the effectiveness of our tactic in overcoming prior limitations where heavy&#8208;atom doping often compromises color purity, paving the way for next&#8208;generation emitters in advanced display and lighting applications.

         <title>Observation of Nonlinear Topological Corner States Originating from Different Spectral Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of higher&#8208;order topological insulator with hybrid edges supporting zero&#8208;dimensional corner states originating from different spectral charges is reported. Different spectral charges are manifested in different internal structure and localization properties of topological states, as we demonstrate experimentally in fs&#8208;laser written waveguide arrays. Such topological states give rise to rich families of topological corner solitons at high powers.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators (HOTIs) are unique topological materials supporting edge states with the dimensionality at least by two lower than the dimensionality of the underlying structure. HOTIs are observed on lattices with different symmetries, but only in geometries, where truncation of HOTI produces a finite structure with the same order of discrete rotational symmetry as that of the unit cell, thereby setting the geometry of insulator edge. Here, a new type of 2D HOTI based on the Kekul&#233;&#8208;patterned lattice is experimentally demonstrated, whose order of discrete rotational symmetry differs from that of the unit cells of the constituent honeycomb lattice, with hybrid boundaries that help to produce all three possible corners that support effectively 0D corner states of topological origin, especially the one associated with spectral charge 5/6. It is also shown that linear corner states give rise to rich families of stable hybrid nonlinear corner states bifurcating from them in the presence of focusing nonlinearity of the material. Such new types of nonlinear corner states are observed in hybrid HOTI inscribed in transparent nonlinear dielectric using fs&#8208;laser writing technique. The results complete the class of HOTIs and open the way to observation of topological states with new internal structure and&#160;symmetry.

         <title>Site Specific In3&#8314;&#8208;Alloying Unlocks Intense Photoluminescence and High Stability in Antimony Halide Hybrids for WLED and Anticounterfeiting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an In3+ alloyed antimony halide hybrid (C4H12N2)5[(SbCl5)2(InCl6)Cl4] exhibiting high stability, large stokes shift, and near unity photoluminescence quantum yield is successfully prepared, which is an excellent yellow phosphor for applications such as WLED lighting and anti&#8208;counterfeiting.








Abstract
While metal doping strategies have proven effective in regulating the bandgap and enhancing the photophysical properties of hybrid metal halides, site&#8208;specific atom alloying by mixing metals of different elements offers a new route for material modification. Here an antimony halide hybrid material with the formula of (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(SbCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbCl) is shown with crystallographically independent alternating square pyramidal [SbCl&#8325;] and octahedral [SbCl&#8326;] sites sandwiched by organic layers. Interestingly, the octahedral site of the [SbCl&#8326;] can be fully replaced by the In3+ ions, forming the alloyed compound (C&#8324;H&#8321;&#8322;N&#8322;)&#8325;[(SbCl&#8325;)&#8322;(InCl&#8326;)Cl&#8324;] (Py&#8208;SbInCl). More importantly, the latter shows a near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield of 97%, which is &#8776;7 times of enhancement compared to the pristine Py&#8208;SbCl compound. This is mainly due to the much&#8208;enhanced Young's modulus, higher radiative decay rates and longer electron transient rates, presumably stemming from shorter In&#9472;Cl bond distances and higher dipole moments, as revealed by a cocktail study of X&#8208;ray single&#8208;crystal crystallography, density functional theory, femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy and so on. In addition, it is shown that Py&#8208;SbInCl is an excellent yellow phosphor that can be used for white light&#8208;emitting diodes and other applications such as counterfeiting. Therefore, making site&#8208;specific alloying compounds may open a new design approach for functional bimetallic hybrid materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Bioproduction of Extracellular Vesicles from Stem Cell Spheroids via Millifluidic Vortex Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stem cell spheroids, produced via a high&#8208;throughput microfabrication technique, are transported within a vortex generated at the outlet channels of a cross&#8208;slot millifluidic chip. For Reynolds number exceeding 170&#8211;200, intermittent high shear stresses applied to each spheroid within the vortex trigger a massive release of biologically active extracellular vesicles.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as novel therapeutics, particularly in cancer and degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, from both market and clinical viewpoints, high&#8208;yield production methods using minimal cell materials are still needed. Herein, a millifluidic cross&#8208;slot chip is proposed to induce high&#8208;yield release of biologically active EVs from less than three million cells. Depending on the flow rate, a single vortex forms in the outlet channels, exposing transported cellular material to high viscous stresses. Importantly, the chip accommodates producer cells within their physiological environment, such as human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) spheroids, while facilitating their visualization and individual tracking within the vortex. This precise control of viscous stresses at the spheroid level allows for the release of up to 30000 EVs per cell at a Reynolds number of &#8776;400, without compromising cellular integrity. Additionally, it reveals a threshold initiating EV production, providing evidence for a stress&#8208;dependent mechanism governing vesicle secretion. EVs mass&#8208;produced at high Reynolds displayed pro&#8208;angiogenic and wound healing capabilities, as confirmed by proteomic and cytometric analysis of their cargo. These distinct molecular signatures of these EVs, compared to those derived from monolayers, underscore the critical roles of the production method and the 3D cellular environment in EV generation.

&lt;p&gt;Stem cell spheroids, produced via a high-throughput microfabrication technique, are transported within a vortex generated at the outlet channels of a cross-slot millifluidic chip. For Reynolds number exceeding 170&#8211;200, intermittent high shear stresses applied to each spheroid within the vortex trigger a massive release of biologically active extracellular vesicles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are emerging as novel therapeutics, particularly in cancer and degenerative diseases. Nevertheless, from both market and clinical viewpoints, high-yield production methods using minimal cell materials are still needed. Herein, a millifluidic cross-slot chip is proposed to induce high-yield release of biologically active EVs from less than three million cells. Depending on the flow rate, a single vortex forms in the outlet channels, exposing transported cellular material to high viscous stresses. Importantly, the chip accommodates producer cells within their physiological environment, such as human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) spheroids, while facilitating their visualization and individual tracking within the vortex. This precise control of viscous stresses at the spheroid level allows for the release of up to 30000 EVs per cell at a Reynolds number of &#8776;400, without compromising cellular integrity. Additionally, it reveals a threshold initiating EV production, providing evidence for a stress-dependent mechanism governing vesicle secretion. EVs mass-produced at high Reynolds displayed pro-angiogenic and wound healing capabilities, as confirmed by proteomic and cytometric analysis of their cargo. These distinct molecular signatures of these EVs, compared to those derived from monolayers, underscore the critical roles of the production method and the 3D cellular environment in EV generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Hollow Gyroids with Bicontinuous Mesostructures: A Highly Robust Electrocatalyst Fixation Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hollow gyroid carbon (HGC), synthesized via the self&#8208;assembly of block copolymers and vapor pressure&#8208;induced hollow structuring, provides a robust platform for embedding Pt nanoparticles. The HGC morphology facilitates efficient mass transport while the pyridine N inherent in the block copolymer enhances electrical conductivity and electrochemical durability, leading to outstanding performance in polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The electrochemical degradation of Pt/C in commercial proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) is a major challenge that limits their durability and performance. This degradation mainly arises from carbon corrosion, which facilitates the detachment of electrocatalyst particles that are weakly bound to catalyst supports. Herein, unusually robust hollow gyroid morphologies designed for strong electrocatalyst fixation and extensive surface accessibility during oxygen reduction reactions (ORR) are reported. To obtain self&#8208;assembled gyroid nanostructures using a poly(styrene&#8208;b&#8208;2&#8208;vinylpyridine) (PS&#8208;b&#8208;P2VP) block copolymer, a solvent vapour treatment with dimethylformamide, which is highly selective for the P2VP block, is applied. It is discovered that retaining residual solvent in the gyroid&#8208;forming P2VP microdomain before carbonization is crucial for forming hollow gyroids with embedded electrocatalysts. These hollow gyroid carbon&#8208;Pt (HGC&#8208;Pt) nanostructures exhibit a 3.6&#8208;fold enhancement in electrochemically active surface area compared to solid gyroid carbon (SGC) counterparts. Based on systematic analyses, this exceptional electrochemical stability is attributed to greatly enhanced surface accessibility derived from the hollow geometry, uniform and robust catalyst embedding, and extensive pyridinic nitrogen doping from the P2VP block.

Tracking InOx/m&#8208;ZrO2 Dynamics for Green Methanol
This study combines in situ transmission electron microscopy with automated, machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based difference imaging to classify and rank the dynamic behavior of supported indium oxide species during CO2 hydrogenation to methanol. The results reveal that partially reduced InOx species on monoclinic zirconia undergo a cyclic mechanism involving migration, growth, reversible coalescence, and dispersion, explaining the high stability observed on this support. These insights provide a new perspective on catalyst dynamics, paving the way for more rational, data&#8208;informed catalyst design strategies. More details can be found in article number 2419859 by P&#233;rez&#8208;Ram&#237;rez and co&#8208;workers.

In article number 2420229, Yu&#8208;Gui Peng, Teng Ma, Hai&#8208;Rong Zheng, Xue&#8208;Feng Zhu, and co&#8208;workers present a general approach for designing an ultrathin ultrasonic metasurface with a high pixel array to achieve various high&#8208;resolution manifold holograms underwater in the far field, greatly enhancing the information capacity encoded in a single metasurface. Multifunctional meta&#8208;devices based on binary amplitude modulation, which can project holographic acoustic fields at different positions or frequencies on demand, provide more opportunities for exploring practical applications of ultrasonic metasurfaces in biomedical engineering.

Hydrogel&#8208;Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector
In article number 2414944, Jung&#8208;Hoon Park, Joonseok Lee, and colleagues present a robust esophageal stent migration prevention system called hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC), featuring a jigsaw puzzle&#8208;shaped porous layer synthesized on the stent surface. These structures enhance interfacial adhesion with hydrogel by inducing mechanical interlocking and energy dissipation during peristalsis, thereby improving stent anchorage to esophageal tissues.

Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) overcome lithium's sustainability limitations (2.36% vs 0.0017% crustal abundance). Perovskite/anti&#8208;perovskite solid electrolytes (SEs) with high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and tunable structures are promising, where anti&#8208;perovskites excel in multi&#8208;dimensional ion channels and interfacial stability.

Abstract
Sodium solid&#8208;state batteries (SSSBs) are poised to revolutionize energy storage by capitalizing on sodium's exceptional crustal abundance (2.36% vs 0.0017% for lithium) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, addressing critical sustainability challenges of lithium&#8208;dependent technologies. Solid electrolytes (SEs) with high ionic conductivity and stability have gained significant attention. The compositional and structural flexibility of perovskites and anti&#8208;perovskites make them competitive, and the combination of advanced computer simulations and synthesis techniques can achieve stable synthesis of the materials. Importantly, the high ionic conductivity and high stability of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs at room temperature endow them with enormous potential for the construction of SSSBs. In this review, the research progress of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs is summarized, different optimization strategies for improving the ionic conductivity of SEs are compared, and an in&#8208;depth discussion on the chemical and electrochemical stability of SEs is provided. Specifically, key technical indicators reflecting their structural tolerance and future application potential have been summarized and discussed for the first time. Among these, anti&#8208;perovskites, due to their diversity and the presence of more ion transport channels, have the potential to become commercial SEs. Finally, the future challenges and development directions of perovskite and anti&#8208;perovskite SEs for SSSBs have been prospected.

         <title>Synthesis of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulator MnBi2nTe3n+1 Family by Chemical Vapor Transport Method with Feedback Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A modified chemical vapor transport method incorporating a feedback&#8208;regulated strategy provides closed&#8208;loop control of the growth temperature of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family within &#177; 0.1&#160;&#176;C, which reveals rich magnetic tunability, such as varying antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4 and inducing magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10.








Abstract
MnBi2nTe3n+1 is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high&#8208;quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback&#8208;regulated strategy is developed, which provides the closed&#8208;loop control of growth temperature within &#177;&#160;0.1&#160;&#176;C. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold&#8208;end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state can be easily replicated. These results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

         <title>Morphogenic Growth 3D Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
I additive manufacturing process exploits the spatial propagation of a polymerization reaction front to produce 3D polymer parts 10&#215; faster and 1000&#215; more energy efficient &#160;than the fastest stereolithography. In contrast with existing 3D printing, this morphogenic process is inspired by biological &#8220;growth and form&#8221; due to the self&#8208;directed propagation of the reaction.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's morphogenesis, a new 3D printing process &#8211;growth printing (GP)&#8211; takes advantage of a self&#8208;propagating curing front to produce 3D polymeric parts following a growth&#8208;like development plan. The propagation of the curing front is driven by the exothermic polymerization of dicyclopentadiene (DCPD), which transforms the liquid resin into a stiff polymer as it propagates at 1 mm s&#8722;1. GP is triggered when a heated initiator contacts the uncured liquid resin in an open container. The initiator nucleates the frontal polymerization reaction and the isotropic radial propagation of the growth front. Simultaneously, the initiator is moved up across the free surface of the resin, pulling the cured object out of the uncured resin. The motion trajectory of the initiator with respect to the free resin surface controls the growth morphology of the 3D part. An inverse design algorithm is developed to produce 3D parts by modeling the reaction&#8208;diffusion&#8208;driven solidification process. This process has substantial energy savings and high printing&#160;speeds.

         <title>Harnessing Near&#8208;Infrared Light for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production from Escherichia coli Interfaced with Biocompatible Low&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymer Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets are interfaced with non&#8208;photosynthetic and non&#8208;genetic engineered Escherichia coli for solar hydrogen production using near&#8208;infrared light. The rationally designed polymer nanosheets play a crucial role in harnessing the broad solar spectrum and injecting photo&#8208;generated electrons into bacteria, thereby enhancing hydrogen production.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel presents a promising pathway for sustainable energy production. However, utilizing the full solar spectrum, particularly the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, remains underexplored in photosynthetic biohybrid systems. In this study, biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets (PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB) are developed to integrate with non&#8208;photosynthetic, non&#8208;genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) for enhanced solar&#8208;driven biological hydrogen production. The PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB nanosheets exhibit unique NIR light absorption properties. Integrating these nanosheets with E. coli facilitates efficient electron transfer, resulting in a 1.96&#8208;fold increase in hydrogen production rate under NIR light. Consequently, this photosynthetic biohybrid system achieves a quantum efficiency of 18.36% at 940&#160;nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets as advanced photosensitizers in semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic systems, offering a robust platform for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum.

         <title>Unlocking the Potential of Oxide&#8208;Based Catalysts for CO2 Photo&#8208;Hydrogenation: Oxygen Vacancies Promoted C&#9472;O Bond Cleavage in Key Intermediates</title>

         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;tailored Co3O4 is employed to investigate how oxygen vacancies perform during CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation, revealing that oxygen vacancies boost the C&#9472;O bond scission, facilitating conversion of various oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Notably, the C&#9472;O bond cleavage in key intermediate formate, identified as the rate&#8208;limiting step, is accelerated on oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich M&#8208;Co3O4, leading to a high activity and selectivity in CH4 production.








Abstract
Oxygen vacancies are generally recognized to play significant roles in CO2 adsorption and activation during CO2 hydrogenation. However, by revisiting its structural/electronic affinity for a range of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates in CO2 hydrogenation processes, the additional roles of oxygen vacancies can be long overlooked and underestimated. Herein, using CO2 (photo&#8208;)methanation as a model reaction, Co3O4 with abundant oxygen vacancies is employed to investigate the relationship between oxygen vacancies and the formation/conversion of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates. Combined analyses of in situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy and theoretical calculations reveal that the key intermediate is formate, whose C&#9472;O bond cleavage is inferred to be the rate&#8208;limiting step during CO2 methanation on Co3O4. Remarkably, leveraging the oxygen vacancy&#8208;mediated C&#9472;O bond scission to accelerate the conversion of formate, the CH4 production activity (1108.1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1) and selectivity (93%) are improved significantly. This comprehensive study provides valuable insights into the multifaceted roles of oxygen vacancies in CO2 hydrogenation reactions, establishing a solid foundation toward the design and development of high&#8208;performance oxide&#8208;containing/&#8208;based catalysts for the conversion of CO2 into various valuable chemicals.

         <title>TOP&#8208;Zn Steric Hindrance Effect Enables Ultra&#8208;Uniform CsPbX3 Quantum Dots for Wide&#8208;Color Gamut Displays</title>

Ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is applied to depress spectral broadening. This strategy is confirmed to work in blue/green/red PQDs, achieving record&#8208;breaking narrowed spectral FWHMs (15, 17, and 25 nm respectively). These PQDs realize a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% NTSC and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, pure&#8208;red PeLED exhibits a high EQE of exceeding 20%.








Abstract
Perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are expected to be an ideal candidate for wide&#8208;color gamut displays owing to their high color purity. However, their color purity is challenged by remarkable spectral broadening due to non&#8208;uniform size distribution and crystal defects. Here, a ligand&#8208;ion (TOP&#8208;Zn) complex&#8208;modulating nucleation strategy is proposed to depress spectral broadening. This is achieved by enhancing the steric hindrance effect during lead&#8208;halogen octahedral assembly and reducing the reaction activity/sites of the system. This strategy is universal and has been confirmed to be effective for blue, green, and red PQDs, achieving narrowed spectral full&#8208;width&#8208;at&#8208;half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 15, 17, and 25&#160;nm, respectively. These FWHMs are record&#8208;breaking and contribute to a wide color gamut coverage of &#8776;130% National Television Standards Committee and &#8776;100% Rec. 2020 standard. Meanwhile, these PQD&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) exhibit a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of exceeding 20% at their pure color range. These results provide a feasible path to achieve ultra&#8208;uniform and pure&#8208;color luminescent PQDs for wide&#8208;color gamut displays.

         <title>Molecular Engineering Enables Bright Carbon Dots for Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence Imaging and In Vivo Optogenetics</title>

Intrinsic, deep defective and surface states are proved in CDs. Hydrogen bonding (HB) is found to be detrimental to surface state emission of CDs through non&#8208;radiative decay pathway, while polarization promoted the surface state emission in a single decay pathway. By eliminating HB and promoting polarization&#8208;induced charge transfer, engineered CDs with fluorescence QY up to 98.1% are synthesized and applied for various applications.








Abstract
Improving the fluorescence quantum yield (QY) of carbon dots (CDs) is essential for expanding their applications. Understanding the photoluminescence mechanism of CDs can provide valuable insights for QY improvement. In this study, it is demonstrated that polarization facilitated the surface state emission of CDs through a single decay pathway, while hydrogen bonding (HB) is identified as a factor that hindered the surface state emission of CDs through non&#8208;radiative decay. Following an in&#8208;depth evaluation of these mechanisms, the QY of CDs is markedly enhanced by engineering molecules onto their surfaces. This strategy not only eliminated HB but also promoted polarization&#8208;induced charge transfer. Notably, the QY of the yellow&#8208;emitting CD is elevated to 98.1%. Capitalizing on their long&#8208;term stability, excellent water solubility, two&#8208;photon excitation capacity, and non&#8208;toxicity, the engineered CDs are successfully applied in dual&#8208;color super&#8208;resolution fluorescence imaging in living cells, two&#8208;photon imaging of zebrafish, and optogenetic regulation in the deep brain of freely&#8208;moving animals.

         <title>From Molecule to Aggregate: Designing AIE Nanocrystals for Low&#8208;Power Backward Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation Angiography</title>

An organic BTHG agent called OTBP with prominent crystallinity is developed. The resonant absorption at 433&#160;nm and prominent crystallinity of OTBP enhance its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. Tuning the size of OTBP nanocrystals based on Mie scattering theory successfully enables them to achieve high&#8208;contrast muti&#8208;organ angiography with ultra&#8208;low pulse energy (100 pJ) and thereby negligible photodamage risk.








Abstract
Organic materials featuring third harmonic generation (THG) hold great promise for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging due to their good biocompatibility and second near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, minimizing photodamage from the incident light necessitates significant improvements in the third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility. Herein, an organic luminogen called OTBP is developed as a backward THG (BTHG) contrast agent for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;angiography. OTBP's intense absorption at 433&#160;nm resonantly enhances its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. In the aggregate state, the robust intermolecular interactions among OTBP molecules realize excellent crystallinity and the facile preparation of nanocrystals (NCs) with a high refractive index of 1.78. By leveraging Mie scattering theory, the best size of OTBP NCs for BTHG collection is attained. These integrated properties result in a high BTHG efficiency of OTBP NCs. Encapsulating the NCs with F&#8208;127 enables ultralow&#8208;power but high&#8208;contrast 3D vasculature imaging with negligible photodamage and background interference. Further elevating the laser power to 60&#160;mW enables the visualization of microvessels at 500&#160;&#181;m with a high SNR of 143. This study offers insights into material design strategies toward efficient organic BTHG contrast agents and paves the way for the materials&#8208;oriented non&#8208;linear optics.

Robust 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper lead&#8208;tin perovskites demonstrate exceptional resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate deposition, achieving a high accuracy of 90.1% in MNIST pattern recognition. Additionally, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content&#8208;addressable memory architecture, based on perovskite memristive devices, is proposed for neuromorphic applications, demonstrating ultralow energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit&#8722;1 per cell.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have drawn great attention for neuromorphic electronic devices in recent years, however, the toxicity of lead as well as the variability and energy consumption of operational devices still pose great challenges for further consideration of this material in neuromorphic computing applications. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) metal halides system of formulation BA2Pb0.5Sn0.5I4 (BA = n&#8208;butylammonium) is prepared that exhibits outstanding resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) deposition. In particular, the device exhibits excellent switching characteristics (endurance of 5 &#215; 105 cycles, ON/OFF ratio &#8776;105) and achieves 90.1% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. More importantly, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content addressable memory (CAM) architecture building on perovskite memristive devices for neuromorphic applications, called nCAM, is proposed, which has a minimum energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit/cell. A mechanism involving the manipulation of trapping states through Cs2CO3 deposition is proposed to explain the resistive switching behavior of the memristive device.

         <title>Tailoring Synergistic Ion Environment for Copper Telluride toward High&#8208;Capacity and Ultrastable Acidic Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes are disclosed in acidic multivalent&#8208;ion batteries for the first time to achieve a high capacity of up to 409 mAh g&#8722;1 and a long cycling lifespan of 40&#8201;000 cycles. Composite in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements and spectroscopic analyses show that the synergistic copper&#8208;ion/proton electrolyte environment ensures stable reversible storage of copper&#8208;ions and prevents potential material oxidation.








Abstract
Acidic batteries permit a reliable energy supply at low temperatures with low cost and intrinsic safety, yet the development of stable acid&#8208;resistant electrodes with high capacity and a reliable lifespan is still challenging. Herein, nonstoichiometric copper telluride (Cu2&#8208;xTe) nanosheets are first explored as high&#8208;performance electrodes for acidic batteries to provide a stable capacity release of 409 mAh g&#8722;1 with a record&#8208;breaking lifespan of 40&#160;000 cycles and excellent kinetics, enabling operation at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1. In contrast to the inherent perception of corrosive destruction of electrode materials by strongly acidic environments, the electrolyte environment enriched with copper ions and hydrogen ions synergistically stabilizes the Cu2&#8208;xTe electrode and drives reversible multielectron transfer asymmetric deep conversion, which is confirmed by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, first&#8208;principal calculations, and composite electrochemical characterization. Therefore, Cu2&#8208;xTe provides an impressive accumulation capacity of over 4764 Ah g&#8722;1, exceeding that of most acidic batteries, and works well at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. High&#8208;performance Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes also promote the establishment of Cu2&#8208;xTe//Mn2O3 and Cu2&#8208;xTe//Fe acidic full cells enabling stable operation at room temperature and low temperature, offering promising opportunities for electrode progress in advanced acidic batteries.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Impregnated Robust Interlocking Nano Connector (HiRINC) for Noninvasive Anti&#8208;Migration of Esophageal Stent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) aims to address stent migration by improving tissue adhesion and reducing mechanical mismatch in self&#8208;expandable metallic stents (SEMSs). The network&#8208;like porous layer of HiRINC enhances adhesion and energy dissipation, demonstrates through ex vivo and in vivo tests, effectively preventing migration in esophageal models.








Abstract
Migration of implanted self&#8208;expandable metallic stent (SEMS) in the malignant or benign esophageal stricture is a common complication but not yet resolved. Herein, this research develops a hydrogel&#8208;impregnated robust interlocking nano connector (HiRINC) to ensure adhesion and reduce the mechanical mismatch between SEMSs and esophageal tissues. Featuring a network&#8208;like porous layer, HiRINC significantly enhances adhesion and energy dissipation during esophageal peristalsis by utilizing mechanical interlocking and increasing hydrogen bonding sites, thereby securing SEMS to tissues. The anti&#8208;swelling property of HiRINC prevents excessive hydrogel expansion, avoiding esophageal blockage. Ex vivo and in vivo adhesion tests confirm that the HiRINC outperforms flat surfaces without RINC structures and effectively prevents stent migration. HiRINC&#8208;coated SEMS maintains its position and luminal patency, minimizing stent&#8208;induced tissue hyperplasia and inflammatory responses in rat and porcine esophageal models during the 4&#8208;week follow&#8208;up. This novel HiRINC&#8208;SEMS can ensure anti&#8208;migration and prolonged stent patency in the rat and porcine esophagus and seems to be expanded to other nonvascular luminal organs and various implantable metallic devices.

         <dc:description>
To address off&#8208;target organ enrichment and low endosomal escape during mRNA delivery, the study learns from the technology of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and integrate cholesterol moieties and zwitterionic species into branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (hPAEs) to obtain &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; LNP&#8208;like hPAEs (O&#8208;LhPAEs), which have spleen&#8208;targeted delivery and have potential for the treatment of silicosis by nebulization.








Abstract
mRNA therapeutics hold tremendous promise for disease prevention and treatment. Development of high&#8208;performance mRNA delivery systems with enhanced transfection efficiency and a safety profile will further fulfill their therapeutic potential and expedite their translation. The synthesis of &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; highly branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (O&#8208;LhPAEs) is reported by integrating the essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for spleen&#8208;selective mRNA enrichment and nebulization treatment of silicosis. 60 O&#8208;LhPAEs with distinct branched structure and chemical composition, including tertiary/quaternary amines, cholesterol moieties, zwitterionic species, and hydrophobic alkyl tails, are synthesized using sequential Michael addition, ring&#8208;opening, and nucleophilic substitution reactions. The unique topological structure and chemical composition collectively enhanced O&#8208;LhPAEs/mRNA polyplex serum resistance, cellular uptake, and endosomal escape. The optimal O&#8208;LhPAE, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12, exhibits up to 93.1% mRNA transfection across 11 different cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, stem cells, neurological cells, and astrocytes. Biodistribution study reveals that 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12/mRNA polyplexes are mainly enriched in the spleen following systemic administration. Through nebulization, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12 mediated high Tbx2 mRNA expression in the lungs of silicosis mice, effectively restoring lung functions. This study not only establishes a strategy for development of LNP&#8208;like O&#8208;LhPAEs but also provides promising candidates for highly safe, efficient, and spleen&#8208;selective mRNA delivery and nebulization treatment of silicosis.

         <title>Dielectric&#8208;Tailored Space Charge Layer and Ion Coordination Structure for High&#8208;Voltage Polymer All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel composite solid&#8208;state polymer electrolyte incorporated dielectric BaTiO3 nanofillers (PDB) for advanced high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. The design achieves a tailored coordination structure, diminished space charge layer, improved ion transport, and enhanced oxidative stability, making this approach a promising strategy for practical long&#8208;cycling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
The poor structural stability of polymer electrolytes and sluggish ion transport kinetics of interfaces with cathode limit the fundamental performance improvements of polymer all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries under high voltages. Herein, it is revealed that by introducing dielectric BaTiO3 in an in&#8208;situ polymerized composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte, the generated interaction between the ether group of polymer electrolyte and dielectric material could effectively regulate the lithium&#8208;ion (Li+) coordination structure to achieve an oxidative potential higher than 5.2&#160;V. The dielectric BaTiO3 with spontaneous polarization also weakens the space charge layer effect between the cathode and electrolyte, facilitating fast Li+ transport kinetics across the cathode/electrolyte interfaces. The all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/Li batteries with the dielectric composite solid&#8208;state electrolyte exhibit an ultra&#8208;long cycling life of 1800 and 1300 cycles at room temperature under high cut&#8208;off voltages of 4.6 and 4.7&#160;V, respectively. This work highlights the critical role of dielectric materials in high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolytes and provides a promising strategy to realize high&#8208;voltage long&#8208;life all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Implanted Magnetoelectric Bionic Cartilage Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
VAFe bionic cartilage hydrogel with a double&#8208;network semi&#8208;crosslinked chain entanglement structure and motion&#8208;driven magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation effect shows the high water content, a porous structure, good mechanical properties, and the electromagnetic effect of the bionic cartilage, which provides a functional compensation and a suitable induced environment for the defective cartilage repair.








Abstract
Enhancing defective cartilage repair by creating a bionic cartilage hydrogel supplemented with in situ electromagnetic stimulation, replicating endogenous electromagnetic effects, remains challenging. To achieve this, a unique three&#8208;phase solvent system is designed to prepare a magnetoelectric bionic cartilage hydrogel incorporating piezoelectric poly(3&#8208;hydroxybutyric acid&#8208;3&#8208;hydroxyvaleric acid) (PHBV) and magnetostrictive triiron tetraoxide nanoparticles (Fe3O4 NPs) into sodium alginate (SA) hydrogel to form a dual&#8208;network, semi&#8208;crosslinked chain entanglement structure. The synthesized hydrogel features similar composition, structure, and mechanical properties to natural cartilage. In addition, after the implantation of cartilage, the motion&#8208;driven magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation model is triggered by gentle joint forces, initiating a piezoelectric response that leads to magnetoelectric&#8208;coupled cyclic transformation. The freely excitable and cyclically enhanced electromagnetic stimulation it can provide, by simulating and amplifying endogenous electromagnetic effects, obtains induced defective cartilage repair efficacy superior to piezoelectric or magnetic stimulation alone.

         <title>Mechanical Robust Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Composites with Designable Cryptic Coloration and Electromagnetic Wave&#8208;Transparent Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;mimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer structural material is developed by a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy, achieving high mechanical properties, tunable colors and superior EM wave&#8208;transparent performance. These characteristics make it hold great potential as a protective material for radar and communication equipment.








Abstract
Ceramic materials are widely used in various protective equipment owing to their excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability, while their applications are limited by monotonous color and poor toughness. Inspired by the colorful and tough natural shells, nacre&#8208;mimetic alumina (Al2O3)&#8208;based (NMA) composites are fabricated by proposing a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy inspired by&#160;the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The NMA composites achieve color regulation, providing possibilities for their application in camouflage protective armor. The fracture toughness of the optimal NMA composite is more than three times that of commercial Al2O3 ceramic. Simultaneously, the NMA composites have obvious advantages in terms of impact resistance compared with Al2O3 ceramic and polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the NMA composites provides favorable structural conditions for transmission of electromagnetic (EM) waves at the frequency band of 18&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz. These characteristics make the NMA composites potential protective materials for radar and communication equipment.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sheet Shape Transformation by Internally&#8208;Driven, Oriented Forces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is implemented to embed dermal fibroblasts in collagen&#160;in contact with anisotropic hydrogel fibers. Fibroblasts generate traction forces and remodel the collagen matrix, following the alignment cues of the hydrogel template. The orientational order is transferred to the fibroblasts, inducing collective alignment. Cell alignment generates internally driven, oriented forces that ultimately lead to programmed 2D and 3D shape changes of the cell&#8208;laden collagen matrices, such as&#160;transforming from square to diamond, or from flat to dome. This approach provides insights into the role of topological defects in morphogenesis and advances new techniques for developing shape&#8208;morphing materials with programmable forces.








Abstract
During morphogenesis, cells collectively execute directional forces that drive the programmed folding and growth of the layers, forming tissues and organs. The ability to recapitulate aspects of these processes in&#160; vitro will constitute a significant leap forward in the field of tissue engineering. Free&#8208;standing, self&#8208;organizing, cell&#8208;laden matrices are fabricated using a sequential deposition approach that uses liquid crystal&#8208;templated hydrogel fibers to direct cell arrangements. The orientation of hydrogel fibers is controlled using flow or boundary cues, while their microstructures are controlled by depletion interaction and probed by scattering and microscopy. These fibers effectively direct cells embedded in a collagen matrix, creating multilayer structures through contact guidance and by leveraging steric interactions amongst the cells. In uniformly aligned cell matrices, oriented cells exert traction forces that can induce preferential contraction of the matrix.

     alt="Cell-Sheet Shape Transformation by Internally-Driven, Oriented Forces"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy is implemented to embed dermal fibroblasts in collagen&#160;in contact with anisotropic hydrogel fibers. Fibroblasts generate traction forces and remodel the collagen matrix, following the alignment cues of the hydrogel template. The orientational order is transferred to the fibroblasts, inducing collective alignment. Cell alignment generates internally driven, oriented forces that ultimately lead to programmed 2D and 3D shape changes of the cell-laden collagen matrices, such as&#160;transforming from square to diamond, or from flat to dome. This approach provides insights into the role of topological defects in morphogenesis and advances new techniques for developing shape-morphing materials with programmable forces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During morphogenesis, cells collectively execute directional forces that drive the programmed folding and growth of the layers, forming tissues and organs. The ability to recapitulate aspects of these processes in&#160; vitro will constitute a significant leap forward in the field of tissue engineering. Free-standing, self-organizing, cell-laden matrices are fabricated using a sequential deposition approach that uses liquid crystal-templated hydrogel fibers to direct cell arrangements. The orientation of hydrogel fibers is controlled using flow or boundary cues, while their microstructures are controlled by depletion interaction and probed by scattering and microscopy. These fibers effectively direct cells embedded in a collagen matrix, creating multilayer structures through contact guidance and by leveraging steric interactions amongst the cells. In uniformly aligned cell matrices, oriented cells exert traction forces that can induce preferential contraction of the matrix. Simultaneously, the matrix densifies and develops anisotropy through cell remodeling. Such an approach can be extended to create cell arrangements with arbitrary in-plane patterns, allowing for coordinated cell forces and pre-programmed, macroscopic shape changes. This work reveals a fundamentally new path for controlled force generation, emphasizing the role of a carefully designed initial orientational field for manipulating shape transformations of reconstituted&#160;matrices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Doped P'2 Mn&#8208;Based Layered Oxide with Superior Stability and High Capacity for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>

High&#8208;entropy doped P'2&#8208;Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 layered oxide cathode material associated with P'2&#8208;OP4 bi&#8208;phase transition yields superior cyclability (97.8% over 100 cycles) in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The high&#8208;entropy doping can effectively regulate the energy level splitting of the eg* orbital and crystal fields, thus mitigating the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion while maintaining the TMO6 octahedra anisotropy.








Abstract
P'2&#8208;NaxMnO2 (NMO) features an ultra&#8208;high specific capacity in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which, however, suffers from a fast capacity decay. To improve the stability, a high&#8208;entropy doped P'2&#8208;Na0.59Mn0.90Ti0.02Cu0.02Ni0.02Co0.02Fe0.02O1.95F0.05 (NMHE0.1OF) is developed to lessen the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and address the multiple phase transition issue. Physicochemical characterizations reveal that the NMHE0.1OF yields a lower anisotropy in the Mn&#9472;O bond than does the undoped NMO. Theoretical calculations indicate that the cation doping enhances the coordination ability of oxygen and the F doping breaks the electronic symmetry of Mn. The in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction result reveals that the NMO experiences a more abrupt and irreversible OP4&#8208;P'2&#8208;P&#8243;2 tri&#8208;phase transition; and the NMHE0.1OF features a mild and reversible OP4&#8208;P'2 bi&#8208;phase transition, which originates from the alleviation in the contraction/expansion of the transition metal slabs evidenced by ex situ extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure. The bi&#8208;phase transition favors the compatibility between the NMHE0.1OF and the ether&#8208;based electrolyte at high voltages. As a result, the NMHE0.1OF yields a superior cyclability (97.8% capacity retention after 100 cycles at 100&#160;mA g&#8722;1) with a notable specific capacity of 224 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10&#160;mA g&#8722;1. This work provides an effective strategy for the rational design of cathode materials with high capacity and superior stability.

         <title>Degradable Additive Couple Enable Pure and Stable Alpha&#8208;Phase FAPbI3 for Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradable additive couple is developed to enable pure and preferential&#8208;oriented &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite with a bandgap of 1.489 eV and robustness against light, heat, and moisture over 1000 h, without the additive residue. The resultant perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.20% with a short current density of 26.40 mA cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term operational stability of over 1000 h.








Abstract
Pure black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 has always been pursued because of its ideal bandgap (Eg) and high thermal stability. Here, a pair of sacrificial agents containing diethylamine hydrochloride (DEACl) and formamide (Fo) is reported, which can induce the oriented growth of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 along (111) and will disappear by the aminolysis reaction during perovskite annealing, retaining the Eg of FAPbI3 as 1.49&#160;eV. In addition, the tensile strain of the target FAPbI3 is found to be mitigated with a stabilized black phase due to the tilt of FA+. The devices based on the pure and stable black&#8208;phase (111)&#8208;FAPbI3 achieved a power conversion efficiency of 25.2% and 24.2% (certified 23.51%) with an aperture area of 0.09 and 1.04 cm2, respectively. After 1080 h of operation at the maximum power point under 1&#8208;sun illumination (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2), the devices maintained 91.68 &#177;&#160;0.72% of the initial efficiencies.

         <title>Ultralow Voltage Operation of p&#8208; and n&#8208;FETs Enabled by Self&#8208;Formed Gate Dielectric and Metal Contacts on 2D Tellurium</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te for near&#8208;ideal FETs, featuring low&#8208;resistance NiTex&#8208;Te contacts and ultraclean TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectrics (0.88 nm EOT). A record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 is achieved at 10 K, and 2D Te&#8208;based CMOS inverters operate at 0.08 V, enabling energy&#8208;efficient IC technologies.








Abstract
The ongoing demand for more energy&#8208;efficient, high&#8208;performance electronics is driving the exploration of innovative materials and device architectures, where interfaces play a crucial role due to the continuous downscaling of device dimensions. Tellurium (Te), in its 2D form, offers significant potential due to its high carrier mobility and ambipolar characteristics, with the carrier type easily tunable via surface modulation. In this study, atomically controlled material transformations in 2D Te are leveraged to create intimate junctions, enabling near&#8208;ideal field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) for both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type operation. A NiTex&#8208;Te contact provides highly transparent interfaces, resulting in low contact resistance, while the TiOx&#8208;Te gate dielectric forms an ultraclean interface with a capacitance equivalent to 0.88 nm equivalent oxide thickness (EOT), where the quantum capacitance of Te is observed. Subthreshold slopes (SS) approach the Boltzmann limit, with a record&#8208;low SS of 3.5 mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 achieved at 10 K. Furthermore, 2D Te&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) inverters are demonstrated operating at an ultralow voltage of 0.08&#160;V with a voltage gain of 7.1 V/V. This work presents a promising approach to forming intimate dielectric/semiconductor and metal/semiconductor junctions for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.

         <title>Boosting Leaching of Spent Ternary Cathode via Strong Van Der Waals Force Beyond Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel design strategy is proposed by strengthening the van der Waals forces in the nanostructure of DESs, which significantly enhances the reducibility of DESs components. Benefiting from this, the leaching kinetics of metals is greatly improved, resulting in an excellent leaching performance that far exceeds previous reports.








Abstract
Promoting the green and efficient recycling of critical metals in spent ternary batteries represents a crucial step in driving the reduce of resource dependence in the electric vehicle industry. However, the leaching progress of metals from spent cathodes generally requires high reaction temperatures and large usage of solvents. Herein, a strategy is proposed to strengthen the van der Waals forces between solvent components by constructing affinity interactions between functional groups (e.g., &#8208;OH and &#8208;COOH), which can significantly enhance the leaching kinetics of metals at a high solid&#8208;liquid ratio and low temperature (30&#160;&#176;C). The results demonstrate that the strong van der Waals force between ascorbic acid with &#8208;OH group and betaine ions with &#8208;COOH group can strengthen the nucleophilicity of the carbon atoms and reduce the specific C&#9472;C bond energy, thus enhancing the redox capability of the DESs. Encouragingly, the designed solvent shows an impressive leaching performance at a super high S/L ratio (1: 3) without external heating for the actual black mass under a scaled&#8208;up experiment.

         <title>Modulating the Spatio&#8208;Temporal Sequence of Lithium Plating and Stripping via a 3D Host for Solid State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting 3D host is employed in solid&#8208;state batteries to modulate lithium plating and stripping behaviors, which can occur away from the interface to tackle dendrite and void formation issues. In situ electron microscopies and molecular dynamics simulations reveal the Li transport pathways in carbon&#8208;based Li metal anodes, which enable faster Li diffusion and high stripping capacity.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (SSLMBs) are now under intensive research for their high energy density and excellent safety. However, the Li transport limitation in Li metal anode (LMA) leads to mass/stress accumulation, dendrite initiation and void formation at the interface, which seriously hinders the development of SSLMBs. Herein, it is demonstrated through in situ electron microscopies that a mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (MIEC) 3D host can promote the Li transport in LMA by increasing the diffusion pathways along the carbonaceous framework, carbon/Li interface and Li metal surface, enabling a fast and long&#8208;distance (nearly 100&#160;&#181;m) diffusion of Li atoms in LMA. Consequently, the spatio&#8208;temporal sequence of Li plating/stripping can be fundamentally changed. Specifically, both deposition and dissolution can occur far away from the interface, thereby mitigating the dendrite and void issues. Impressively, the resulting cells with carbonaceous hosts can achieve excellent cyclability and the highest capacity (28.8&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) so far. This work provides valuable insight for understanding Li transport and deposition/dissolution mechanisms in MIEC host&#8208;based LMAs, and a feasible solution for tackling the interface issues without involving stack pressure in SSLMBs.

         <title>Pre&#8208;Established Ion Transport Pathways Through Electrolyte Initiator for High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Interface Enabling Ultra&#8208;Stable Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ multifunctional polymer interface layer with high&#8208;efficiency Zn2+ transport is prepared through the pre&#8208;established ion transport pathways of an innovative electrolyte initiator. This layer promotes rapid Zn2+ desolvation and uniform Zn2+ deposition, effectively suppressing interfacial side reactions and dendrite growths, thereby significantly extending the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries.









Abstract
Achieving stable zinc&#8208;metal anodes is pivotal to realizing high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;metal batteries (AZMBs). The construction of a functional polymer interface layer on the zinc&#8208;metal anode surface is confirmed as an effective strategy for mitigating dendrite growth and side reactions, thereby significantly enhancing the stability of zinc&#8208;metal anode. However, polymers capable of withstanding electrolyte environments over the long term typically suffer from elevated interfacial impedance, which hinders Zn2+ transport. Here, a pioneering zinc&#8208;metal anode enabled by a functional polymer interface layer with high&#8208;efficiency ion transport is introduced. This polymer layer is polymerized in situ on the zinc&#8208;metal anode surface through an innovative redox initiation system, where zinc trifluoromethanesulfonate (Zn(OTf)2) salts function as both reductant and ion transport pre&#8208;pathways, ensuring high&#8208;efficiency ion transport. The resultant interface layer achieves an ideal balance of ionic conductivity, water resistance, adhesion, and mechanical properties, effectively suppressing dendrite growth and side reactions. Symmetric cells assembled with this interface layer deliver an impressive lifespan of 8800 and 1600&#160;h under 1 and 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This interface layer further demonstrates exceptional feasibility and versatility in Zn&#8208;NVO and Zn&#8208;PANI batteries. This work provides groundbreaking insights into the strategic design of high&#8208;performance polymer interface layers for AZMBs.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile strategy is proposed based on host&#8208;guest doping to achieve stimulus&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable, and time&#8208;dependent organic afterglow glasses by dynamic triplet energy transfer processes. Impressively, the phosphorescence resonance energy tranfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer mechanisms are revealed by fs&#8208;TA spectra. The potential applications of these organic glasses in advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting, dynamic data encryption, as well as large&#8208;area and flexible afterglow display are demonstrated.








Abstract
Dynamic organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) glasses with color tunability offer significant potential for practical applications due to their high transparency and excellent machinability. In this study, organic glasses with efficient and dynamic RTP properties are used as triplet donors, combined with commercially available chromophores as singlet/triplet acceptors, to successfully fabricate a series of host&#8208;guest doping glasses with color&#8208;tunable organic afterglow and dynamic responses to external stimuli. The energy transfer mechanisms, including triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet phosphorescence resonance energy transfer and Dexter&#8208;type triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet energy transfer, are confirmed using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art femtosecond time&#8208;resolved transient absorption spectroscopy. These organic glasses demonstrate excellent transparency, good machinability, and dynamic responsiveness to external stimuli. The study highlights their potential applications in large&#8208;area afterglow glass fabrication, dynamic data encryption, and flexible afterglow displays. This work not only provides a simple design principle for developing novel organic glass materials with color tunability and dynamic responses but also promotes the potential applications of organic RTP materials in dynamic information encryption and flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Dual Modification of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Exceptional High Piezo&#8208;Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dual&#8208;modification approach, &#9472;NH&#8322; groups modification and Cu ions coordination, is first imposed on MIL&#8208;125, which greatly improved carrier separation due to the enhanced piezoelectricity of MOFs caused by polarity alteration, leading to exceptional high piezo&#8208;photocatalytic hydrogen production.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) face significant challenges in photocatalysis due to severe carrier recombination. Here, a novel approach is presented that incorporates &#9472;NH2 groups and Cu ions onto MOFs with a MIL&#8208;125 skeleton, forming NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 and Cu&#8208;NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125. This modification effectively enhances the polarity of MOFs, evidenced by significantly increased d33 values (from 1.69 to 26.21 pm/V) and notable higher dipole moments (from 6.60 to 25.99 D). Notably, it's the first demonstration of boosting MOFs piezoelectricity via a dual modulation strategy.

     alt="Dual Modification of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Exceptional High Piezo-Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel dual-modification approach, &#9472;NH&#8322; groups modification and Cu ions coordination, is first imposed on MIL-125, which greatly improved carrier separation due to the enhanced piezoelectricity of MOFs caused by polarity alteration, leading to exceptional high piezo-photocatalytic hydrogen production.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) face significant challenges in photocatalysis due to severe carrier recombination. Here, a novel approach is presented that incorporates &#9472;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; groups and Cu ions onto MOFs with a MIL-125 skeleton, forming NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 and Cu-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125. This modification effectively enhances the polarity of MOFs, evidenced by significantly increased d&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; values (from 1.69 to 26.21 pm/V) and notable higher dipole moments (from 6.60 to 25.99 D). Notably, it's the first demonstration of boosting MOFs piezoelectricity via a dual modulation strategy. Moreover, the polarity can be further amplified by ultrasonic vibration based on the positive piezoelectric effect, which is justified by in situ Raman spectra, COMSOL simulations, and DFT calculations, by taking into account the applied pressure. The positive impact of introduced piezoelectric effect in facilitating charge separation and transfer of Cu-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125, proved by enhanced current response. Consequently, through coupling piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of Cu-NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 can be significantly enhanced to &#8776;2884.2 &#181;mol&#183;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2.76 and 9.92 times higher than that of NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-MIL-125 and MIL-125, respectively, ranking first in all reported MOF-based piezo-photocatalysts. This research demonstrates the prospective opportunity for alleviating the severe carriers recombination problem for MOFs through the implantation of piezoelectric field driving force.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;Tunable and Full&#8208;Color Circularly Polarized Long&#8208;Lived Phosphorescence in Chiral Superstructure Elastomers</title>

         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with robust glum values, full&#8208;color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system.








Abstract
Developing full&#8208;color circularly polarized organic ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (CP&#8208;OURTP) materials with high dissymmetry factor (glum) holds significant promise for diverse optoelectronic applications. Controlling glum values is crucial for enhancing the performance and functionality of these materials, as it directly influences their chiroptical properties and potential utilities in advanced technologies. However, achieving reversible and dynamic manipulation of glum in CP&#8208;OURTP materials remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is presented to fabricate the chiral superstructure elastomers (CSEs) that display selective reflection colors, dynamically tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with robust glum values, full&#8208;color afterglow emissions, and superior processability within a single system. By integrating room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) polymers into the CSEs, CSEs are produced demonstrating tunable CP&#8208;OURTP with glum values switching between 0.8 and 0.15 by mechanical deformation. More importantly, these mechanochromic, programmable, and full&#8208;color CP&#8208;OURTP films enable the development of flexible and dynamic information encryption and decryption. The work provides new insights into the development of novel RTP materials and advances in their potential applications.

         <title>Europium(II) Complex with d&#8208;f Transition: New Emitter for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells with an External Quantum Efficiency of 19.8%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide Eu(II) complex is demonstrated as an emitter in&#160;light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) for the first time. The bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II)&#160;complex based LEC achieved a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18).








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have good prospects in the solid&#8208;state lighting field due to their simple single&#8208;layer structure and low manufacturing cost. However, the lack of high&#8208;efficiency blue LECs limits their development and further application. To solve this problem, many luminescent materials with various mechanisms such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence are studied as emitters in LECs. Besides these materials, herein lanthanide europium(II) (Eu(II)) complex with d&#8208;f transition is demonstrated as a new type of emitter for LECs. In detail, a blue emitting Eu(II) complex bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) is dispersed into 9&#8208;(3&#8208;(triphenylsilyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;3,9&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole host and tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte to make a blend film, which attains a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100%. The LEC using the blend film as an active layer achieves a blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency of &#8776;100%. This work reveals that Eu(II) complex with d&#8208;f transition is a promising emitter toward high&#8208;performance blue LECs, which can inspire further research on Eu(II) complex based LECs.

         <title>Tracking Dynamics of Supported Indium Oxide Catalysts in CO2 Hydrogenation to Methanol by In Situ TEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging with machine learning&#8208;based image analysis, this study directly visualizes and tracks dynamic restructuring in reducible oxide catalysts for green methanol synthesis. The findings reveal how supports modulate dynamic behaviors of reaction&#8208;induced InOx species, underpinning the superior methanol productivity of the In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst.








Abstract
Supported reducible oxides, such as indium oxide on monoclinic zirconia (In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2), are promising catalysts for green methanol synthesis via CO2 hydrogenation. Growing evidence suggests that dynamic restructuring under reaction conditions plays a crucial but poorly understood role in catalytic performance. To address this, the direct visualization of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art In2O3/m&#8208;ZrO2 catalyst under CO2 hydrogenation conditions (T&#160; = &#160;553&#160;K, P&#160; = &#160;1.9&#160;bar, CO2:H2&#160; = &#160;1:4) is pioneered using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), comparing its behavior to In2O3 on supports with similar (tetragonal, t&#8208;ZrO2 or anatase TiO2) or lower (LSm&#8208;ZrO2) surface areas. Complementary in situ infrared spectroscopy and catalytic tests confirm methanol formation under equivalent conditions. A machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based difference imaging approach differentiates and ranks restructuring patterns, revealing that partially reduced InOx species on m&#8208;ZrO2 undergo cyclic aggregation&#8208;redispersion via atomic surface migration, maintaining high active phase dispersion. High&#8208;resolution ex situ STEM analysis further shows the epitaxial formation of In2O3 mono&#8208; and bilayers on (100) m&#8208;ZrO2 facets, highlighting strong oxide&#8208;support interactions. In contrast, sintering prevails on t&#8208;ZrO2, a&#8208;TiO2, and low&#8208;surface m&#8208;ZrO2, correlating with lower methanol productivity. This work underscores the pivotal role of oxide&#8208;support interfacial interactions in the reaction&#8208;induced restructuring of InOx species and establishes a framework for tracking nanoscale catalyst dynamics.

         <title>Carbon Dot&#8208;Linked Hydrogel for TAMs Transform: Spatiotemporal Manipulation to Reshape Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>

The CDs crosslinked egg white hydrogel loaded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CA170 (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C) can realize spatiotemporal tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) transformation from multi&#8208;level dimensions, including spatial recruitment, cell phenotype reprogramming, and immune checkpoint molecule blockade. Finally, at the in vivo level, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C can stimulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling and reduce tumor recurrence with satisfactory biosafety.








Abstract
As one of the most crucial immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulating tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) is vital for enhancing antitumor immunity. Here, an injectable carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;linked egg white hydrogel was developed, termed TAMs Transform Factory (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C), to spatiotemporally manipulate TAMs. The fabricated CDs significantly promoted macrophage migration. Notably, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C achieved macrophage spatial enrichment through CDs&#8208;induced directional recruitment with molecular Ctnnd1 upregulation. Subsequently, the recruited macrophages were locoregionally reprogrammed within TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C, as well as blocking the upregulated PD&#8208;L1. Finally, through multi&#8208;stage regulation at spatial, cellular, and molecular levels, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C released immune&#8208;activated M1 macrophages to the tumor site as it degraded. Moreover, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C promoted dendritic cell (DCs) maturation and further boosted T cell activation, thereby reshaping the tumor&#8208;suppressive TME. Through peritumoral injection, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C enhanced tumor immunotherapy in both subcutaneous and recurrent 4T1 tumor models with satisfactory biosafety. Therefore, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C is proposed to become a safe and powerful platform for various biomedical applications.

         <title>Photochromic Control in Hybrid Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine is applied to halide perovskite materials and the corresponding solar cells, demonstrating photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques. This results in improvements in photovoltaic performances and operational stabilities, highlighting the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in photovoltaics.








Abstract
The application of perovskite photovoltaics is hampered by issues related to the operational stability upon exposure&#160;to external stimuli, such as voltage bias and light. The dynamic control of the properties of perovskite materials in response to light could ensure the durability of perovskite solar cells, which is especially critical at the interface with charge&#8208;extraction layers. We&#160;have applied a functionalized photochromic material based on spiro&#8208;indoline naphthoxazine at the interface with hole&#8208;transport layers in the corresponding perovskite solar cells with the aim of stabilizing them in response to voltage bias and light. We demonstrate photoinduced transformation by a combination of techniques, including transient absorption spectroscopy and Kelvin probe force microscopy. As a result, the application of the photochromic derivative offers improvements in photovoltaic performance and operational stability, highlighting&#160;the potential of dynamic photochromic strategies in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Manifold Acoustic Holography Based on High&#8208;Pixel&#8208;Array Binary Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an approach for the efficient generation of manifold acoustic holograms underwater by using high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurfaces. Beyond generating simple&#8208;pattern holograms, it is shown that increasing the pixel numbers within a single metasurface allows for the creation of 2D/3D complex holographic fields. Moreover, it is demonstrated that holograms at multiple depths or frequencies can be encoded within one metasurface, thereby enhancing its information capacity. This work holds significant potential for applications in fields such as biomedical imaging and non&#8208;contact particle manipulation. 








Abstract
Acoustic holograms using artificial materials have become an area of intense interest in acoustics due to the great potential in various applications such as medical imaging, underwater detection and object manipulation, etc. In this article, a general approach is proposed for designing high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurfaces and then fabricating the intricate ultrathin structures via picosecond laser processing for implementing high&#8208;resolution manifold holograms in far fields. The angular spectrum propagation is utilized in combination with the forward optimization, instead of the Rayleigh&#8208;Sommerfeld integral, to efficiently simulate far&#8208;field holograms at the target plane. To obtain manifold acoustic holograms in the planes at different depths, zero&#8208;padding is utilized to break the tight constraint of sampling theorem. Benefiting from the realizable high&#8208;pixel&#8208;array binary metasurface, e.g., the number of pixels &#8776;90 000 or even more, high&#8208;resolution complicated holograms can be readily achieved. As an example, multi&#8208;depth holography, multi&#8208;frequency holography, and sophisticated holography are generated via binary metasurfaces. The functional meta&#8208;devices based on ultrasound amplitude modulations provide more opportunities for exploring practical applications of acoustic metamaterials.

         <title>Noninvasively Real&#8208;Time Monitoring In&#8208;Vivo Immune Cell and Tumor Cell Interaction by NIR&#8208;II Nanosensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A noninvasive second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength nanosensor (C8R&#8208;DSNP) for real&#8208;time monitoring of immune cell&#8208;tumor interactions in vivo is reported. The sensor detects caspase&#8208;8 activation during natural killer cells&#8208;induced apoptosis in tumor cells, providing dynamic, early&#8208;stage imaging within 4.5 h of treatment. This approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies with rapid, in vivo feedback.








Abstract
Immunocytotherapy holds significant promise as a novel cancer treatment, but its effectiveness is often hindered by delayed responses, requiring evaluations every 2&#8211;3 weeks based on current diagnostic methods. Early assessment of immune cell&#8208;tumor cell interactions could provide more timely insights into therapeutic efficacy, enabling adjustments to treatment plans. In this study, a noninvasive nanosensor (C8R&#8208;DSNP) for real&#8208;time monitoring of in vivo immune cell activities in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L) window (1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm), which offers deep tissue transparency, is reported. The C8R&#8208;DSNP responds rapidly to caspase&#8208;8, a key apoptotic signaling molecule generated during interactions between natural killer (NK&#8208;92) cells and tumor cells. Using ratiometric NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L fluorescence imaging, dynamic in vivo observations of NK&#8208;92 cells' engagement with tumor cells in a mouse model are captured. These results demonstrate tumor cells apoptosis that happens as early as 4.5 h after NK&#8208;92 cells infusion. Additionally, in vitro urine imaging confirmed the initiation of apoptosis via cleaved fluorescent small molecules, while single&#8208;cell tracking within blood vessels and tumors further elucidated immune cell dynamics. This real&#8208;time NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L monitoring approach offers valuable insights for optimizing immunocytotherapy strategies.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Carbon Capture with Fluorine&#8208;Tailored Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance carbon capture using fluorine&#8208;tailored carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes is developed. By incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups into the polymer precursor, the derived CMS membranes achieve exceptional CO&#8322; permeability of 47,190 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3, maintaining 36,204 Barrer permeability and 35.3 selectivity under flue gas conditions.








Abstract
Increasing energy consumption and climate change present an urgent global challenge to achieve carbon neutrality, with CO2 capture as a top priority. Among various carbon capture technologies, CO2 membrane separation stands out for its simplicity and energy efficiency in applications including gas purification and industrial gas recovery.

&lt;p&gt;A high-performance carbon capture using fluorine-tailored carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes is developed. By incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups into the polymer precursor, the derived CMS membranes achieve exceptional CO&#8322; permeability of 47,190 Barrer and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 28.3, maintaining 36,204 Barrer permeability and 35.3 selectivity under flue gas conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasing energy consumption and climate change present an urgent global challenge to achieve carbon neutrality, with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture as a top priority. Among various carbon capture technologies, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; membrane separation stands out for its simplicity and energy efficiency in applications including gas purification and industrial gas recovery. Herein, a series of fluorine-tailored porous carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes derived from precisely designed precursors, achieving a well-balanced high permeability and selectivity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation are developed. Incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups disrupted dense chain packing and promoted pore formation with enhanced permeability and selectivity for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; separation. The &lt;b&gt;TFM-550&lt;/b&gt; membrane, derived from a fluorinated stretched polymer backbone precursor, exhibits exceptional performance with a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 47&#160;190&#160;&#177;&#160;3204 Barrer and a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 28.3&#160;&#177;&#160;5.7, while &lt;b&gt;TFM-800&lt;/b&gt; presented a higher selectivity of 71.8&#160;&#177;&#160;11.5, surpassing the 2019 upper bound. Furthermore, under flue gas conditions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/1/4 in molar ratio), the CMS membrane demonstrate high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 36,204&#160;&#177;&#160;2,235 Barrer and outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 35.3&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8.

         <title>A Colorful Electrochromic Infrared Emissivity Regulator for All&#8208;Season Intelligent Thermal Management in Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spectrally selective colorful electrochromic infrared emissivity regulator (CECIER) is presented for all&#8208;season building thermal management. It enables multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window while reducing parasitic heat through high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window. The regulator achieves &#8776;2&#176;C (night) and 3&#176;C (day) temperature adjustments and 3.46 MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 annual building energy savings.








Abstract
Radiative cooling is a technology that utilizes the high emissivity of materials in the atmospheric window to achieve cooling, showing great application prospects in building energy&#8208;saving. However, traditional static passive radiative cooling materials with broad&#8208;spectrum high emissivity can lead to increased heating energy consumption in winter due to overcooling and a weakened cooling effect in summer due to the urban heat island effect. In this study, a colorful, intelligent infrared emissivity regulator is well designed based on a multi film ultrathin electrochromic device for all&#8208;season thermal management in buildings. The infrared emissivity of the regulator can vary in real time in response to seasonal or temperature variations, allowing for the switching between radiative cooling and insulation. Guided by nano&#8208;photonics theory for multilayer optical films, the regulator achieves multi&#8208;modal dynamic infrared emissivity regulation in the atmospheric window &#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$&#916;&#949;&#175;$\Delta \ \bar{\varepsilon }$, and the high reflectance in the non&#8208;atmospheric window inhibits heat gains from the external environment. The regulator demonstrates excellent environmental adaptivity with an acceptable response time, a long cycle life, and good bending resistance. The regulator can achieve &#8776;2 &#176;C/3 &#176;C (nighttime/daytime) temperature adjustment. The simulation results indicate that the regulator can achieve an annual building energy saving of 3.46&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2.

         <title>Current Control of Spin Helicity and Nonreciprocal Charge Transport in a Multiferroic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting multiferroic state of spin origin with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) can be controlled and detected by electric current in a high&#8208;temperature helimagnet YMn6Sn6. The underlying concept is the coupling of the electric current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$. The controllability of state variables like P and T in conductors enhances the potential of spin&#8208;helicity&#8208;based spintronics.









Abstract
A multiferroic state with both electronic polarity (P) and magnetization (M) shows the inherently strong P&#8208;M coupling when P is induced by cycloidal (N&#233;el&#8208;wall like) spin modulation. The sign of P is determined by the clockwise or counterclockwise rotation of spin, termed the spin helicity. Such a multiferroic state is not limited to magnetic insulators but can be broadly observed in conductors. Here, the current control of the multiferroics is reported in a helimagnetic metal YMn6Sn6 and its detection through nonreciprocal resistivity (NRR). The underlying concept is the coupling of the current with the toroidal moment T&#8764;P&#215;M&#8764;(q&#770;&#215;&#967;v)&#215;M$\bm{T}\sim \bm{P}\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}\sim (\widehat{\bm{q}}\ensuremath{\times{}}{\bm{\chi}}_{v})\ensuremath{\times{}}\bm{M}$ as well as with the magneto&#8208;chirality &#967;v &#183; M, whereq&#770;$\hspace*{0.28em}\widehat{\bm{q}}$ and &#967;v are the unit modulation wave vector and the vector spin chirality, respectively. An enhancement of NRR is furthermore observed by the spin&#8208;cluster scattering via &#967;v and its fluctuation. These findings may pave the way to an exploration of multiferroic conductors and the application of the spin&#8208;helicity degree of freedom as a state variable.

         <title>A Durable Metalgel Maintaining 3&#215;106 S&#8729;M&#8210;1 Conductivity under 1&#160;000&#160;000 Stretching Cycles</title>

This work presents a new metalgel that immobilizes liquid metal continuum within waterborne polyurethane networks through electrostatic interactions. The polymer network, enriched with dynamic reversible structures, provides a durable structure for repeated stretching. Simultaneously, the electrostatic interactions enable synchronous deformations of both polymer networks and liquid metal. Benefiting from this design, this durable metalgel exhibits a high and stable conductivity of 3 &#215; 106 S&#8729;m&#8722;1 even after 1&#160;000&#160;000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting&#8208;edge applications.








Abstract
Conductive elastomers are in high demand for emerging fields such as wearable electronics and soft robotics. However, it remains unavailable to realize the desired metal&#8208;level conductivity after extensive stretching cycles, which is a necessity for the above promising application. Here, a new material is presented that employs an elastic, homogeneous, and dense waterborne polyurethane network to immobilize the liquid metal continuum via electrostatic interactions. This new design enables the liquid metal continuum to deform synchronously and reversibly with the polymer network, preserving its conductive structure and significantly enhancing durability. The resulting durable metalgel exhibits conductivity of 3 &#215; 106 S&#8729;m&#8722;1, which remains stable after 1&#160;000&#160;000 stretching cycles. This work overcomes the performance limitations of current conductive elastomers and unlocks new opportunities for cutting&#8208;edge applications in wearable technology and robotics.

         <title>Creating Sodium Ion Channels via De Novo Encapsulation of Ionophores for Enhanced Water Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a synthetic membrane with sodium ionophores integrated into a covalent organic framework, mimicking the permselectivity and cation discrimination of biological ion channels. The membrane exhibits high Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivities of 3.6 and 103, respectively, and improves power density by a 4.6&#8208;fold in the presence of high&#8208;valent cation salts, enhancing energy conversion efficiency.








Abstract
Biological ion channels achieve remarkable permselectivity and cation discrimination through the synergy of their intricate architectures and specialized ionophores within confined nanospaces, enabling efficient energy conversion. Emulating such selectivity in synthetic nanochannels, however, remains a persistent challenge. To address this, a novel host&#8208;guest assembly membrane is developed by incorporating sodium&#8208;selective ionophores into a &#946;&#8208;ketoenamine&#8208;linked covalent organic framework (COF). This design confers exceptional permselectivity and Na+ selectivity, achieving Na+/K+ and Na+/Li+ selectivity ratios of 3.6 and 103, respectively, along with near&#8208;perfect Na+/Cl&#8722; selectivity under a 0.5&#160;M || 0.01&#160;M salinity gradient. Notably, the membrane dynamically switches its permselectivity to favor anion transport in the presence of high&#8208;valent cations (e.g., Ca2+), overcoming limitations such as uphill cation diffusion and back currents observed in conventional cation&#8208;selective membranes. This adaptive behavior yields a 4.6&#8208;fold increase in output power density in Ca2+&#8208;rich environments. These findings advance the design of biomimetic nanochannels with unparalleled ion selectivity and enhanced energy conversion efficiency.

         <title>Memristive InAs&#8208;Based Semiconductors with Anisotropic Ion Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Memristive semiconductor HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3 exhibits memristive switching and maintains semiconductor properties through ion migration in its vdW gaps. Low ion migration energy enables a low set voltage, while its low&#8208;symmetry structure produces anisotropic ion transport, offering insights into directional dependence. These findings can guide the development of energy&#8208;efficient memtransistors.








Abstract
The use of the van der Waals (vdW) gap as an ion migration path, similar to cathode materials in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, enables improved ion migration. If these materials also possess semiconductor properties, they can simultaneously control electron or hole transport. Such materials can be used in memtransistors, which combine memory and semiconductor characteristics. However, the existing materials rely on defects such as grain boundaries as migration paths, resulting in high ion migration energy barriers and switching voltages. Herein, memtransistors are demonstrated using HxNa2&#8208;xIn2As3, which utilizes the vdW gap for ion migration, resulting in lower ion migration energy barriers. It is confirmed that ion migration occurs more readily in the [010] direction in a low&#8208;symmetry crystal structure owing to a lower migration energy barrier, whereas migration does not occur in the [100] direction, demonstrating directional dependence. This finding provides crucial guidelines for identifying ion migration in semiconductor materials, which can otherwise be overlooked. The use of the vdW gap as the migration path, variation in migration energy barriers with the ion movement direction, and their impact on low power consumption are critical factors that will guide the future development of memtransistor materials.

         <title>Wettability Sequence Optimization and Interface Strain Buffering in Triple Mesoporous Layer&#8208;Based Printable Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is regulated via the flexible molecule of dodecaethylene glycol (DEG) with abundant polar oxygen atoms. The regulation modulated the wetting sequence of the scaffold, promoted perovskite crystallization in the scaffold, and relaxed interface stress. The device with interface regulation successfully achieved an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.27% and demonstrated good stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have achieved remarkable progress in photovoltaic performance, driven by advancements in interface engineering. The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer is particularly critical, as it governs both perovskite crystallization and the formation of residual strain. In this study, the buried interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) based on a triple&#8208;mesoporous scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon is reconstructed by employing dodecaethylene glycol (DEG), a long chain molecule rich in polar oxygen atoms, to enhance device performance. Treating the scaffold with DEG optimizes the wettability sequence across the three layers by improving the TiO2 surface's wettability, facilitating the preferential crystallization of perovskite in the underlying TiO2 layer. Moreover, the DEG layer effectively buffers residual strain and suppresses detrimental defects at the interface. As a result, p&#8208;MPSCs with the optimized interface achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% and retain over 92% of their initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Chiroferromagnetic Quantum Dots for Chiroptical Synapse (ChiropS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiroptical activity is enhanced by up to 0.003 in the g&#8208;factor through the induction of ferromagnetism in quantum dots. A chiroptical neuromorphic synapse, composed of chiroferromagnetic quantum dots, generates different synaptic weights from multiple wavelengths and circularly polarized light. The low&#8208;level preprocessing unit of the multi&#8208;channel neuromorphic device functions as a low&#8208;level optical noise filter, enabling energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices using circularly polarized light (CPL) offer enhanced sensitivity and specificity for efficient data processing. There is a growing demand for CPL sensing mediums with strong optical activity, stability and sensitivity, multiple transition bands, and environmental compatibility. Here, defect&#8208;engineered chiroferromagnetic quantum dots (CFQDs) are used as a new type of CPL sensing material. By inducing amorphization defects through chiral molecules, CFQDs with high unpaired electron density, atomic structural chirality, amplified chiroptical activity, and multiple exciton transition bands are developed. CFQDs enable nonlinear, long&#8208;term plastic behavior with linear optical input, acting as in situ noise filters that reduce noise by over 20%. Additionally, CFQDs provide over nine times higher integration for photon polarization and wavelength distinctions, paving the way for next&#8208;generation processors with improved energy efficiency, integration, and reduced retention time.

         <title>Facet Engineering of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Triboelectric Nanogenerators&#8208;Based Self&#8208;Powered Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent strategy is developed to fabricate dendritic ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D with tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. The reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating capability lead to significantly improved performance in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis, highlighting the multifunctional potential of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D.









Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly versatile materials with tunable chemical and structural properties, making them promising for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis. However, achieving precise control over MOF coordination structures to optimize facet&#8208;dependent properties remains challenging. Here, a facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent synthesis strategy is presented to fabricate dendrite Co&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole MOF (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D), enabling tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D, enriched with (112) facets, features a reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating ability compared to the conventionally (011) facet&#8208;dominated rhombic dodecahedron ZIF&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;R). This facet engineering boosts TENG charge density by 2.4&#8208;fold, OER current density by 9.9&#8208;fold (@1.65&#160;V), and HER current density by 1.9&#8208;fold (@&#8208;0.3&#160;V). The (112)/(011) facet ratio can be also tuned to precisely alter TENG output. Moreover, the optimized ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D shows excellent stability, maintaining electrolyzer performance for 72&#160;h and enabling TENG devices even in high humidity. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D&#8208;based TENG (D&#8208;TENG) devices exhibit robust energy generation and power ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D||ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D electrolyzers for continuous hydrogen (H2) production. These findings introduce a new paradigm for converting mechanical energy into sustainable chemical energy, offering insights into facet engineering for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting systems.

&lt;p&gt;A facile and scalable dual-solvent strategy is developed to fabricate dendritic ZIF-67-D with tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. The reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron-donating capability lead to significantly improved performance in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis, highlighting the multifunctional potential of ZIF-67-D.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly versatile materials with tunable chemical and structural properties, making them promising for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis. However, achieving precise control over MOF coordination structures to optimize facet-dependent properties remains challenging. Here, a facile and scalable dual-solvent synthesis strategy is presented to fabricate dendrite Co-2-methylimidazole MOF (ZIF-67-D), enabling tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that ZIF-67-D, enriched with (112) facets, features a reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron-donating ability compared to the conventionally (011) facet-dominated rhombic dodecahedron ZIF-67 (ZIF-67-R). This facet engineering boosts TENG charge density by 2.4-fold, OER current density by 9.9-fold (@1.65&#160;V), and HER current density by 1.9-fold (@-0.3&#160;V). The (112)/(011) facet ratio can be also tuned to precisely alter TENG output. Moreover, the optimized ZIF-67-D shows excellent stability, maintaining electrolyzer performance for 72&#160;h and enabling TENG devices even in high humidity. Consequently, ZIF-67-D-based TENG (D-TENG) devices exhibit robust energy generation and power ZIF-67-D||ZIF-67-D electrolyzers for continuous hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) production. These findings introduce a new paradigm for converting mechanical energy into sustainable chemical energy, offering insights into facet engineering for high-performance energy harvesting systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient White Electroluminescence from Cu&#8208;based Perovskite Achieved by High Hole Injection Core/Shell Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide lattice connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals by controlling the reactivity of sulfur precursor in the synthesis. The resulting pure white PeLEDs achieved by combining with yellow emission CsCu2I3 exhibit a recorded EQE of 3.45% and a high CRI of 91.








Abstract
The copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) halide perovskite possesses eco&#8208;friendly features, bright self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton (broadband) emission, and a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) for achieving white emission. However, the limited hole injection (HI) of Cu&#8208;based perovskites has been bottle&#8208;necking the efficiency of white electroluminescence and thus their application in white perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (W&#8208;PeLEDs). In this study, we demonstrate a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) lattice&#8208;connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) by controlling the reactivity of sulfur (S) precursor in the synthesis. Interestingly, the resultant Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S NCs significantly enhance the hole mobility compared to Cs3Cu2I5 NCs. Besides, the photoluminescence quantum yield of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs increases from 26.8% to 70.6% after the Cu2S lattice&#8208;connected capping. Consequently, by establishing the structure of CsCu2I3/Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S in W&#8208;PeLEDs, an external quantum efficiency of 3.45% and a CRI of 91 is realized, representing the highest reported electroluminescent performance in lead&#8208;free Cu&#8208;based W&#8208;PeLEDs. These findings contribute to establishing guidelines and effective strategies for designing broadband electroluminescent materials and device structures of PeLEDs.

         <title>Utilizing Electron&#8208;Sink&#8208;Enhanced Nanoshells for Amplified Nanoplasmonic SERS&#8208;Based In Situ Detection of Cancer Cells, Linking Signal Enhancement with Cellular Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for detecting cancer cells and monitoring apoptosis employs electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Gold (Au) shells coated with electroactive liposome membranes amplify the SERS signal through active electron transfer. This technique enables real&#8208;time and highly sensitive detection of cancer cells by measuring apoptosis&#8208;associated electron flow, offering a powerful approach for distinguishing cancerous from normal cells.








Abstract
A novel method is presented for detecting cancer cells and assessing apoptosis using electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) via active electron transfer. By coating gold (Au) shells with electroactive liposome membranes (ELMs) derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, the SERS signal is enhanced through chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement driven by electron transfer. The ELMs first donate electrons to the Au shells, which, upon laser excitation, amplify the local electromagnetic field, resulting in stronger Raman signals from the attached probing molecules. Additionally, the electron flow from cancer cells into the Au shells correlates with apoptosis, producing a strong SERS signal, while normal cells exhibit weaker signals. This method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer cell apoptosis, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells based on the enhanced Raman signal linked to electron flow. This approach marks a breakthrough in CM&#8208;based SERS applications, offering a sensitive method for cancer detection through the measurement of electron flow.

         <title>In Situ Construction of a 3D Superionic Skeleton in Sodium Anode for Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries with a 15&#160;000&#8208;Cycle Lifespan at 3C</title>

         <dc:description>
In this work, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion coefficient of the anode from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Thanks to the ultrafast ion transport and excellent interfacial stability, the solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery can be stably cycled for more than 15&#160;000&#8208;cycle at 3C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSSMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their natural abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high safety. However, the intrinsically low ionic conductivity of sodium anode (SA) and poor wettability to solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) severely hinder the development of SSSMBs. In this study, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode by simply melting inexpensive and low&#8208;density red phosphorus with sodium, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion rate from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Moreover, Na3P in the composite sodium anode (CSA) effectively induces the uniform deposition of Na on the surface of SSE, significantly reducing the interface impedance of symmetric cells from the initial value of 749.15 to 14.97 &#937; cm2. Enabled by the integrated 3D superionic transport skeleton, the symmetric cell achieves exceptional cycle stability of over 7000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and 4000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Furthermore, SSSMBs incorporating CSA demonstrate an ultralong lifespan of over 15&#160;000 cycles at 3C while maintaining a high&#8208;loading operation capability, significantly outperforming previously reported studies. This study highlights the crucial role of cost&#8208;effective CSA design with enhanced ion transport in advancing high&#8208;performance SSSMBs.

         <title>Synchronous Sterilization and Immunoreaction Termination for Corneal Transparency Protection in Treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Induced Bacterial Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;pore MSNs with a high specific surface area serve as a platform for covalent PMB grafting and bactericidal CQD loading. CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits efficient antibacterial activity alongside synchronous endotoxin neutralization. In Gram&#8208;negative bacterial keratitis, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB effectively and comprehensively suppresses the immune&#8208;inflammatory response, preserving corneal integrity and transparency.








Abstract
In the treatment of infectious keratitis, therapeutic strategies often prioritize enhancing bactericidal efficacy. However, endotoxins released from Gram&#8208;negative bacteria cause inflammatory reaction, leading to corneal structural damage and scar formation. Given that polymyxin B (PMB) can bind and neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this study employs large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (lMSNs) grafted with PMB as carriers for cationic antibacterial carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to prepare CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB, which enables synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization. In the acidic infectious microenvironment, the accelerated release of CQDs eliminates 99.88% bacteria within 2&#160;h, effectively substituting immune mediated sterilization. Notably, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits exceptional LPS neutralization performance (2.22&#160;&#181;g LPS/mg CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB) due to its high specific surface area. In an infectious keratitis model, inflammation subsides significantly within the first day of CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB intervention and is completely resolved by day 3. By day 2, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, interleukin&#8208;6 and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; in CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB group decrease by 86.99%, 91.15%, and 77.56%, respectively, compared to the CQDs&#8208;only sterilization group. Ultimately, corneal integrity and transparency are preserved, with suppressed expressions of fibrosis&#8208;related factors including matrix metalloproteinase 9, transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin. Therefore, this synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization strategy outperforms monotherapy strategies focused solely on sterilization or endotoxin neutralization.

         <title>AI&#8208;Guided Design of Antimicrobial Peptide Hydrogels for Precise Treatment of Drug&#8208;resistant Bacterial Infections</title>

An AI&#8208;guided design platform (AMP&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;Designer) is developed to design antibacterial biomaterials by integrating thiol&#8208;modified AMPs, hydrogels, and Cu&#8208;BTO. The AI&#8208;designed hydrogel exhibits potent bactericidal efficacy against MRSA and E. coli, promotes angiogenesis via mechano&#8208;electrical signals, and accelerates healing in infected wounds.








Abstract
Traditional biomaterial development lacks systematicity and predictability, posing significant challenges in addressing the intricate engineering issues related to infections with drug&#8208;resistant bacteria. The unprecedented ability of artificial intelligence (AI) to manage complex systems offers a novel paradigm for materials development. However, no AI model currently guides the development of antibacterial biomaterials based on an in&#8208;depth understanding of the interplay between biomaterials and bacteria. In this study, an AI&#8208;guided design platform (AMP&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;Designer) is developed to generate antibacterial biomaterials. This platform utilizes generative design and multi&#8208;objective constrained optimization to generate a novel thiol&#8208;containing high&#8208;efficiency antimicrobial peptide (AMP), that is functionally coupled with hydrogel to form a complex network structure. Additionally, Cu&#8208;modified barium titanate (Cu&#8208;BTO) is incorporated to facilitate further complex cross&#8211;linking via Cu2+/SH coordination to produce an AI&#8208;AMP&#8208;hydrogel. In vitro, the AI&#8208;AMP&#8208;hydrogel exhibits &gt; 99.99% bactericidal efficacy against Methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Escherichia coli (E. coli). Furthermore, Cu&#8208;BTO converts mechanical stimulation into electrical signals, thereby promoting the expression of growth factors and angiogenesis. In a rat model with dynamic wounds, the AI&#8208;AMP hydrogel significantly reduces the MRSA load and markedly accelerates wound healing. Therefore, the AI&#8208;guided biomaterial development strategy offers an innovative solution to precisely treat drug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Regulating Carrier Transport Behavior for Capacitive Energy Storage of Polymer Dielectrics in Harsh Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 20, May 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport behavior is regulated rather than the previously oversimplified limitation strategy to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. It is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage level at harsh environments.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy&#8208;storage levels in harsh environments have become key components in electrostatic capacitors. However, excessive losses in polymer dielectrics caused by high carrier densities at high temperatures and strong electric fields often result in low energy storage efficiency, which is the most challenging problem that urgently needs to be solved. In existing studies, the losses are mainly suppressed by limiting carrier formation; however, it is very challenging to completely limit carrier formation, especially at high temperatures and strong electric fields. Therefore, this perspective proposes to regulate the carrier transport behavior through &#8220;guiding/constraining/blocking&#8221; forms rather than the previously oversimplified carrier limitation strategy, which further clarifies dominant structure factors that inhibit carrier transport to reduce losses and enhance energy storage efficiency. Meanwhile, the influence of different structural designs on carrier transport behavior, individually or collaboratively, must be systematically studied to determine the specific mode of carrier transport behavior, thereby establishing a relationship between carrier transport behavior and energy storage efficiency. The presented perspective is expected to offer a novel and effective theoretical basis for the design and fabrication of advanced polymer dielectrics with high capacitive energy storage levels in harsh environments.

         <title>Uni&#8208;Axial Densification of Slurry&#8208;Casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl Tapes: The Role of Particle Size Distribution and Densification Pressure</title>

         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;promise high energy density and safety for electric vehicles. This study examines the densification of slurry&#8208;casted Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl separator tapes, highlighting the role of particle size distribution&#160;and uni&#8208;axial pressure. Wet milling refines particles while preserving conductivity, and a critical compaction threshold leads to superior performance. Structural defects, however, impact cycling stability, underscoring processing optimization needs.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;are transformative solutions for electric vehicles, offering superior energy density and safety. Sulfide&#8208;based solid electrolytes&#160;like Li&#8326;PS&#8325;Cl (LPSCl) combine high ionic conductivity and mechanical adaptability, but challenges remain in scaling up high&#8208;performance separator tapes due to particle size distribution (PSD) and processing constraints. This study investigates the uni&#8208;axial densification of slurry&#8208;casted LPSCl tapes, focusing on PSD refinement and compaction pressure. Wet milling has been identified to effectively reduce PSD to submicron levels while preserving structural integrity and near&#8208;pristine conductivity. A critical pressure threshold (&#8776;350&#160;MPa) for tape&#8208;casted LPSCl slurries (2.5% hydrated poly(acrylonitrile&#8208;co&#8208;butadiene)) is identified, where ionic conductivity peaks due to particle fusion and the formation of conductive networks. However, open porosity (&#8776;30%), particularly along the densification direction, and surface irregularities persist. These structural issues have significant implications for battery performance. For example, surface roughness and interfacial voids lead to localized current focusing, with current densities exceeding applied values by over 20 times. Percolating porosity accelerates dendritic failure modes, undermining stability and limiting cycling rates. This work underscores the need for optimized powder processing and densification techniques to enhance scalability and performance, advancing LPSCl&#8208;based separators for the practical adoption of solid&#8208;state batteries&#160;in electric vehicles&#160;and other high&#8208;energy applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons Activate Pseudo&#8208;Inert Basal Planes of 2D Organic Semiconductors for Improved Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D organic semiconductors are widely believed to have uniformly active surfaces. This study reveals that their basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert due to anisotropic exciton migration. By inducing exciton self&#8208;trapping through dimensional reduction, these inert planes are activated, boosting hydrogen peroxide production by over 350%. The work uncovers key structure&#8211;property relationships for advanced photocatalyst design.









Abstract
2D organic semiconductors are widely considered superior photocatalysts due to their large basal planes, which host abundant and tunable reaction sites. However, here, it is discovered that these basal planes can be pseudo&#8208;inert, fundamentally challenging conventional design strategies that assume uniform activity on the surface of 2D organic semiconductors. Using 2D potassium&#8208;poly (heptazine imide) (KPHI) for hydrogen peroxide photocatalysis as a model, it is demonstrated that the pseudo&#8208;inertness of basal planes stems from preferential exciton transport to edges, instead of interlayer transport in highly ordered structures. Thus, their dimension reduction enables controlled localization of exciton due to the self&#8208;trapping mechanism, whereby the basal planes can transform from pseudo&#8208;inert state into active catalytic sites. With this knowledge, a modified 2D KPHI capable of generating 35 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 of H2O2, which is over 350% increase compared to pristine KPHI, is reported. More interestingly, the activated basal planes promote H2O2 production through a reaction pathway distinct from that of pseudo&#8208;inert basal planes. These findings establish fundamental principles connecting crystal structure, exciton dynamics, and reactive site distribution, providing new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts.

LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. This study reveals the degradation mechanisms and quantifies the relative impact of temperature and pressure factors, providing critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft battery designs.








Abstract
The widespread adoption of electric vehicles has spurred the exploration of airworthy lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) for electric&#8208;powered aircraft. However, LIBs used for aviation exhibit rapid aging and shortened service life due to the harsh conditions of aviation, posing significant risks to flight safety. In this study, a comprehensive analysis is conducted under simulated flight conditions to reveal the degradation mechanism of aviation batteries. Low&#8208;temperature and low&#8208;pressure lead to a sluggish kinetics and hinder thermodynamic process. As the reversibility of Li&#8208;ions insertion and extraction is deteriorates, residual Li&#8208;ions accumulate and plated&#8208;Li on the anode, accelerating the aging process and arising the issue of internal short circuits. Additionally, the interatomic distance of Ni&#8208;coordination induces significant stress variations, which drives an expanded occupation of porosity in the electrode under flight conditions, with 2.13% void spaces of cathode and 13.39% of anode. The formation and growth of cracks elongate the charge transfer pathway, increasing resistance and reducing rate capability. As a result, this study quantifies the degradation mechanisms of aviation batteries and establishes the relative impact weights of temperature and pressure factors, offering critical insights for optimizing future electric aircraft power battery designs.

Geometric Design Strategy for Solid Electrolyte Interphase
In article number 2418773, Jong&#8208;Won Lee, Seungbum Hong, Nam&#8208;Soon Choi, and colleagues demonstrate that a solid electrolyte interphase enriched with small grains enhances Li+ ion transport by providing abundant pathways. Moreover, a soft&#8208;solvating environment improves the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast&#8208;charging conditions. Additionally, replacing ethylene carbonate with isobutyronitrile enables a high discharge capacity during rapid charging while mitigating Li plating.

Interlocking Antiphase Boundary
In article number 2416616, Xi Shen, Jun Miao, Richeng Yu, and co&#8208;workers report a coupling phenomenon between the antiphase boundary (APB) and the 180&#176; ferroelectric domain wall in PbTiO3, which is referred to as the antiphase ferroelectric boundary (APFB). It also illustrates the potential applications of APFBs in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the coupling feature. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and could be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

Rechargeable Deep&#8208;Tissue Implantable Devices
Implantable devices typically rely on batteries that require surgical replacement, leading to potential health risks and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer presents a promising wireless alternative, though its efficiency remains a challenge. The proposed dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;boosted ultrasound triboelectric nanogenerator is a thin, flexible, and biocompatible solution that enables efficient and stable power delivery, even in curved configurations. This innovation paves the way for noninvasive, sustainable wireless energy transfer in biomedical applications. More details can be found in article number 2419264 by Sunghoon Hur, Hyun&#8208;Cheol Song, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Responsive Molecules for Organic Neuromorphic Devices: Harnessing Memory Diversification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Responsive molecules are essential for organic in&#8208;sensor computing devices. This Review highlights recent advances in thedesign, synthesis, and incorporation of electrically, optically, and magnetically responsive molecules in multifunctional synaptic perception devices endowedwith both nonvolatile and volatile memory diversification. By exploiting the multifunctional nature of molecular switches, complex logic operations can be accomplished, bringing molecule&#8208;based neuromorphic computing closer to become a real technology.








Abstract
In the brain, both the recording and decaying of memory information following external stimulus spikes are fundamental learning rules that determine human behaviors. The former is essential to acquire new knowledge and update the database, while the latter filters noise and autorefresh cache data to reduce energy consumption. To execute these functions, the brain relies on different neuromorphic transmitters possessing various memory kinetics, which can be classified as nonvolatile and volatile memory. Inspired by the human brain, nonvolatile and volatile memory electronic devices have been employed to realize artificial neural networks and spiking neural networks, respectively, which have emerged as essential tools in machine learning. Molecular switches, capable of responding to electrical, optical, electrochemical, and magnetic stimuli, display a disruptive potential for emulating information storage in memory devices. This Review highlights recent developments on responsive molecules, their interfacing with low&#8208;dimensional nanostructures and nanomaterials, and their integration into electronic devices. By capitalizing on these concepts, a unique account of neurotransmitter&#8208;transfer electronic devices based on responsive molecules with ad hoc memory kinetics is provided. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed on the use of these devices to engineer more complex logic operations and computing functions at the hardware level.

         <title>Strategic Development of Memristors for Neuromorphic Systems: Low&#8208;Power and Reconfigurable Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates technological trends in brain&#8208;inspired artificial reconfigurable memristors, as well as individual non&#8208;volatile and volatile devices, according to their operating principles and fabrication methods. It examines case studies of artificial neural network system implementations based on these devices, providing the latest comprehensive design guidelines from fundamentals to advanced systems.








Abstract
The ongoing global energy crisis has heightened the demand for low&#8208;power electronic devices, driving interest in neuromorphic computing inspired by the parallel processing of human brains and energy efficiency. Reconfigurable memristors, which integrate both volatile and non&#8208;volatile behaviors within a single unit, offer a powerful solution for in&#8208;memory computing, addressing the von Neumann bottleneck that limits conventional computing architectures. These versatile devices combine the high density, low power consumption, and adaptability of memristors, positioning them as superior alternatives to traditional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology for emulating brain&#8208;like functions. Despite their potential, studies on reconfigurable memristors remain sparse and are often limited to specific materials such as Mott insulators without fully addressing their unique reconfigurability. This review specifically focuses on reconfigurable memristors, examining their dual&#8208;mode operation, diverse physical mechanisms, structural designs, material properties, switching behaviors, and neuromorphic applications. It highlights the recent advancements in low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption solutions within memristor&#8208;based neural networks and critically evaluates the challenges in deploying reconfigurable memristors as standalone devices or within artificial neural systems. The review provides in&#8208;depth technical insights and quantitative benchmarks to guide the future development and implementation of reconfigurable memristors in low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Anisotropic Microcarriers: Fabrication Strategies and Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have gained prominence for their morphological versatility. This review synthesizes two decades of advances in AM development, from fabrication strategies to multifunctional biomedical applications (cell coculture, multidrug delivery, tissue scaffolds, and 3D bioprinting). Systematic analysis of morphology&#8208;dependent effects underscores opportunities for optimizing AM utilization and establishing morphology&#8208;driven innovation frameworks in biomedicine.








Abstract
Anisotropic microcarriers (AMs) have attracted increasing attention. Although significant efforts have been made to explore AMs with various morphologies, their full potential is yet to be realized, as most studies have primarily focused on materials or fabrication methods. A thorough analysis of the interactional and interdependent relationships between these factors is required, along with proposed countermeasures tailored for researchers from various backgrounds. These countermeasures include specific fabrication strategies for various morphologies and guidelines for selecting the most suitable AM for certain biomedical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of AMs, ranging from their fabrication methods to biomedical applications, based on the past two decades of research, is provided. The fabrication of various morphologies is investigated using different strategies and their corresponding biomedical applications. By systematically examining these morphology&#8208;dependent effects, a better utilization of AMs with diverse morphologies can be achieved and clear strategies for breakthroughs in the biomedical field are established. Additionally, certain challenges are identified, new frontiers are opened, and promising and exciting opportunities are provided for fabricating functional AMs with broad implications across various fields that must be addressed in biomaterials and biotechnology.

         <title>Cartilage&#8208;Adaptive Hydrogels via the Synergy Strategy of Protein Templating and Mechanical Training</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabricated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels), via the synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training, achieve cartilage&#8208;like structure and mechanical performances, as well as high&#8208;water retention similar to cartilage. The resulting O&#8208;CN gels has excellent prospects in load&#8208;bearing cartilage engineering application.








Abstract
Cartilage, as a load&#8208;bearing tissue with high&#8208;water content, exhibits excellent elasticity and high strength. However, it is still a grand challenge to develop cartilage&#8208;adaptive biomaterials for replacement or regeneration of damaged cartilage tissue. Herein, protein templating and mechanical training is integrated to fabricate crystal&#8208;mediated oriented chitosan nanofibrillar hydrogels (O&#8208;CN gels) with similar mechanical properties and water content of cartilage. The O&#8208;CN gels with an &#8776;74 wt% water content exhibit high tensile strength (&#8776;15.4 MPa) and Young's modulus (&#8776;24.1 MPa), as well as excellent biocompatibility, antiswelling properties, and antibacterial capabilities. When implanted in the box defect of rat's tails, the O&#8208;CN gels seal the cartilage (annulus fibrosus) defect, maintain the intervertebral disc height and finally prevent the nucleus herniation. This synergy strategy of protein templating and mechanical training opens up a new possibility to design highly mechanical hydrogels, especially for the replacement and regeneration of load&#8208;bearing tissues.

         <title>Multimodal Finger&#8208;Shaped Tactile Sensor for Multi&#8208;Directional Force and Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor inspired by human fingers is developed, capable of simultaneous normal and shear force detection and 98.33% accurate material identification. Integrated into a robot hand and arm system, it enables real&#8208;time detection of gripping force, material identification, advancing haptic sensing in robotics.








Abstract
Multimodal tactile perception is crucial for advancing human&#8211;computer interaction, but real&#8208;time multidimensional force detection and material identification remain challenging. Here, a finger&#8208;shaped tactile sensor (FTS) based on the triboelectric effect is proposed, capable of multidirectional force sensing and material identification. The FTS is composed of an external material identification section and an internal force sensing section. Three materials are embedded into the surface of the silicone shell in the fingerpad, forming single&#8208;electrode sensors for material identification. In the force sensing section, the silicone shell's outer surface is coated with conductive silver paste as a shielding layer. The inner wall has four silicone microneedle arrays and a silicone bump, while five silver electrodes are coated on the internal polylactic acid skeleton. The components connect via interlocking structures near the fingernail, allowing localized contact and separation between the silicone shell and skeleton, enabling force direction detection through signals from the five electrodes. Additionally, the outer sensors achieve 98.33% accuracy in recognizing 12 materials. Furthermore, integrated into a robotic hand, the FTS enables real&#8208;time material identification and force detection in an intelligent sorting environment. This research holds great potential for applications in tactile perception for intelligent robotics.

         <title>Visible Periodic Piezoelectric Domains in Silk Fibroin for Neurite&#8208;Orientated Extension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The piezoelectric SF film with visible periodic piezoelectric domains and excellent biocompatibility is fabricated through a feasible photochemical method with silver nanoparticles as the developer and mediator simultaneously. Consequently, the oriented piezoelectric electric field is achieved under ultrasound and effectively regulates the directional growth and length of neurite and neural gene expression.








Abstract
The development of visible periodic piezoelectric domains is highly attractive but challenging to overcome the homogeneous distribution and lack of visualization of the electric field on traditional piezopolymers. This work reports an in situ synthesis to create customized silver patterns with micron&#8208;level distinguishability. This method serves to form visible periodic piezoelectric domains and endows the silk fibroin (SF) piezoelectric generator with maximum root mean square current, energy density, and voltage of 5.1&#160;mA, 6.7&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 and 529.5&#160;mV, respectively, under an ultrasound intensity of 1.0&#160;W&#160;cm&#8722;2. The oriented piezoelectric electric field is periodically distributed into the SF film with ultrasound&#8208;driven assistance and remarkably regulates neurite directional growth, length, and gene expression. Additionally, these piezoelectric domains enable the direct and timely observation of the electric field's effect on neurites by biological microscopy. This approach paves the way for great potential in tailored electric stimulation for cell biology and medical engineering.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Drop Nano&#8208;Formulation of Catalase Self&#8208;Assembled with Thiolated Chitosan for Effective Treatment of Dry Eye Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan is designed. The obtained nanoparticles after eye&#8208;drop administration could form disulfide bonds with the mucin layer of the team film to achieve enhanced precorneal adhesion, so as to continuously eliminate excessive reactive oxygen species accumulated in the ocular surface to suppress inflammation, resulting in effective treatment of dry eye disease.








Abstract
Dry eye disease (DED), the most prevalent ophthalmological condition worldwide, can cause severe ocular discomfort and even visual impairment. Effective yet safe therapeutics for severe DED are still highly demanded. Herein, considering the important role of excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) in triggering DED, an eye&#8208;drop nano&#8208;formulation of catalase (CAT) self&#8208;assembled with cysteine&#8208;modified chitosan (CS&#8208;Cys) is designed for DED treatment. Upon eye&#8208;drop administration of CS&#8208;Cys/CAT nanoparticles, CS&#8208;Cys can form disulfide bonds with abundant thiols in the mucin layer of the tear film, anchoring catalase to the corneal surface. Thus the excess ROS accumulated on the ocular surface can be effectively eliminated, resulting in a regulated tear microenvironment. In mouse and rabbit models, it is verified that CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops can offer excellent therapeutic effects, especially in promoting the recovery of damaged epithelium and increasing tear secretion. Remarkably, CS&#8208;Cys/CAT eye drops showed notably better therapeutic performance than clinically used cyclosporin and dexamethasone, as well as several new DED drugs in clinical trials. Thus, the work presents a unique nanoparticulate eye&#8208;drop&#8208;based ocular delivery system to allow prolonged ocular retention of protein therapeutics, and such nanoformulation formulated by fully biocompatible/biodegradable components possesses significant translational potential for effective and safe DED treatment.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Ionic Engineering of Antiferromagnetically RKKY&#8208;Coupled Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Artificial antiferromagnetically coupled multilayered heterostructures with tailored interlayer exchange interactions and perpendicular magnetic anisotropy hold great promise for applications such as magnetic random&#8208;access memory, magnetic sensors, and spintronics. Voltage&#8208;driven ion migration (i.e., magneto&#8208;ionics) enables post&#8208;synthesis tuning of these magnetic stacks, allowing significant modulation of the various switching events and transitions between antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferrimagnetic (FiM) states.








Abstract
Voltage&#8208;driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto&#8208;ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy&#8208;efficient next&#8208;generation micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non&#8208;magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto&#8208;ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum&#8208;group metals. In this work, room&#8208;temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni&#8208;based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion&#8208;like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage&#8208;driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage&#8208;triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post&#8208;synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic&#8208;field sensing, energy&#8208;efficient memories and spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;Voltage-driven ion motion offers a powerful means to modulate magnetism and spin phenomena in solids, a process known as magneto-ionics, which holds great promise for developing energy-efficient next-generation micro- and nano-electronic devices. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs), consisting of two ferromagnetic layers coupled antiferromagnetically via a thin non-magnetic spacer, offer advantages such as enhanced thermal stability, robustness against external magnetic fields, and reduced magnetostatic interactions in magnetic tunnel junctions. Despite its technological potential, magneto-ionic control of antiferromagnetic coupling in multilayers (MLs) has only recently been explored and remains poorly understood, particularly in systems free of platinum-group metals. In this work, room-temperature voltage control of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida (RKKY) interactions in Co/Ni-based SAFs is achieved. Transitions between ferrimagnetic (uncompensated) and antiferromagnetic (fully compensated) states is observed, as well as significant modulation of the RKKY bias field offset, emergence of additional switching events, and formation of skyrmion-like or pinned domain bubbles under relatively low gating voltages. These phenomena are attributed to voltage-driven oxygen migration in the MLs, as confirmed through microscopic and spectroscopic analyses. This study underscores the potential of voltage-triggered ion migration as a versatile tool for post-synthesis tuning of magnetic multilayers, with potential applications in magnetic-field sensing, energy-efficient memories and spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Ammonium Ion&#8208;Air Battery Enabled by the Synergy of ORR and NH4+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the synergistic interplay between oxygen reduction reaction and NH4+ storage, and harnesses the synergy for the successful development of a high&#8208;rate and highly stable ammonium ion air battery (AIAB). The assembled AIAB demonstrates outstanding rate performance (89 mAh g&#8722;1 at 15 A g&#8722;1), high energy density (78 Wh kg&#8722;1 at 9369 W kg&#8722;1), and exceptional cycling stability at 10 A g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Ammonium ion batteries (AIBs) offer cost&#8208;effectiveness, nontoxicity, and eco&#8208;friendly attributes in energy storage technology. However, the constrained capacity and poor stability of conventional cathode materials have impeded their widespread adoption. Herein, a synergistic approach is introduced to overcome these challenges, by enhancing the air cathode with NH4+ and simultaneously leveraging atmospheric oxygen as a reservoir for NH4+ storage. Notably, NH4+ significantly enhances the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in neutral environments. Through in situ Raman spectroscopy and quantum density functional theory calculations, it is elucidated how NH4+ can act as a proton donor, replacing H2O in neutral media and reducing energy barriers in the protonation of *O2&#8722; and *O, thereby accelerating ORR kinetics. The resulting ammonium ion&#8208;air battery, comprising an air cathode and a polymer (PNP) anode, showcases impressive metrics: high energy density of 78 Wh kg&#8722;1 and power density of 9369 W kg&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, an initial capacity of 94.3 mAh g&#8722;1 and exceptional cycling stability (70.4% capacity retention after 12&#160;500 cycles) at 10 A g&#8722;1. This pioneering research highlights the synergistic relationship between ORR and NH4+ storage and opens up new avenues for the design and advancement of innovative, sustainable, and environment&#8208;friendly AIBs.

         <title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180&#176; Domain Wall in PbTiO3 &#8211; Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy&#8208;tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI), which can be effectively used to fabricate high&#8208;quality twisted heterostructures, including monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like heterostructure. It also enables the fabrication of suspended 2DMs and high&#8208;performance devices. This technique features excellent scalability, advancing fundamental research on 2DMs, and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.









Abstract
Transfer technique has become an indispensable process in the development of two&#8208;dimensional materials (2DMs) and their heterostructures, as it determines the quality of the interface and the performance of the resulting devices. However, how to flexibly and conveniently fabricate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) twisted heterostructures with high&#8208;quality interfaces has always been a formidable challenge. Here, a quasi&#8208;dry transfer technique assisted by water vapor intercalation (WVI) is developed, which can be flexibly used to fabricate twisted heterostructures. This method leverages a charged hydrophilic surface to facilitate WVI at the interface, enabling the clean and uniform detachment of 2DMs from the substrate. Using this method, the twisted monolayer/few&#8208;layer graphene and 2D quasicrystal&#8208;like WS2/MoS2, highlighting the surface/interface cleanness and angle&#8208;controlled transfer method is successfully fabricated. Besides, suspended structures of these 2DMs and heterostructures are fabricated, which offers substantial convenience for studying their intrinsic physical properties. Further, a high&#8208;performance hBN/graphene/hBN superlattice device with the mobility of &#8776;199,000&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 at room temperature is fabricated. This transfer technique ingeniously combines the advantages of dry transfer and wet transfer. Moreover, it features excellent scalability, providing crucial technical support for future research on the fundamental physical properties of 2DMs and the fabrication of quantum devices with outstanding performance.

         <title>Localized and Controllable Mineral Salts Crystallization Enabled by Dye Modified Gold Nanorods with Enhanced Photothermal Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid materials with enhanced photostability and photothermal properties are prepared by modifying gold nanorods with tailored organic dyes, where plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation are effectively combined. Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO3, BaCO3, and SrCO3, is realized using 638 nm laser light.








Abstract
Well&#8208;designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of &gt;100&#160;&#176;C under 638&#160;nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs&#8208;doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116&#160;&#176;C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO3 (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO3, and SrCO3 are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as&#8208;prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function&#8208;led photothermal materials.

Using the materials as a reusable energy converter, localized, and controllable photothermal crystallization of biorelevant mineral salts, including NaCl, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is realized using 638 nm laser light.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well-designed nanomaterials with favorable photothermal performance are beneficial for exploring fascinating and prospective applications. Herein the facile and effective way is reported to enhance photothermal properties of gold nanorods (GNRs) through immobilizing tailored organic dyes around GNRs. Benefitting from the combination of plasmonic thermalization and nonradiative relaxation, the modified GNRs exhibit a temperature increase of &amp;gt;100&#160;&#176;C under 638&#160;nm laser irradiation in film state, which is double of that of the bare GNRs-doped film under the same condition. The hybrid film also exhibits superior stability and reusability compared to the film only doped with the dyes. Surface temperature of the hybrid film can be adjusted from 31 to 116&#160;&#176;C by tunning either doping materials concentration or light power. Interestingly, the hybrid film serves as a reusable energy converter in confined and controllable photothermal crystallization of mineral salts. NaCl crystals can be arranged into different patterns by moving the laser probe during the crystallization. Microcrystals of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (calcite, vaterite, and aragonite), BaCO&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; and SrCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are successfully obtained. It is believed that the as-prepared materials as well as the demonstrated photothermal crystallization will contribute to the development of function-led photothermal materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hetero&#8208;Trimetallic Atom Catalysts Enable Targeted ROS Generation and Redox Signaling for Intensive Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A typical paradigm to utilize hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (CCF TACs@NVs) with a stable symmetrical pyramid structure for catalytic guided apoptosis and ferroptosis&#8208;induced cell death, which is provided by the multi&#8208;enzymes like abilities under effective tumor aggregation, highlighting the application prospects in the biomedical field.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play crucial roles in cellular metabolic processes by acting as primary intracellular chemical substrates and secondary messengers for cellular signal modulation. However, the artificial engineering of nanozymes to generate ROS is restricted by their low catalytic efficiency, high toxicity, and off&#8208;target consumption. Herein, hetero&#8208;trimetallic atom catalysts (TACs) anchored on a stable symmetrical pyramid structure are designed in the presence of N and P surface ligands from cross&#8208;linked polyphosphazene interlayer&#8208;coated MIL&#8208;101(Fe). The 3D network TACs with a uniform dispersion of Cu, Co, and Fe hetero&#8208;single atoms effectively tailor the active sites to avoid metal sintering, thereby providing sufficient catalytic activity for ROS blooms. Nanovesicle membranes facilitate the stable accumulation of nanozymes with homologous targeting, recognition, and endocytosis, effectively addressing the potentially high toxicity and off&#8208;target defects. Therefore, the outcome of the in situ ROS&#8208;bloom acts as a redox signal for directly regulating oxidative stress in the tumor microenvironment. Meanwhile, ROS intervene in the glutathione peroxidase 4, long&#8208;chain acyl&#8208;CoA synthetase 4, and cysteinyl aspartate specific proteinase&#8208;3 pathways as second messengers, fostering the proclivity toward apoptosis and lipid peroxidation&#8208;regulated ferroptosis pathway concurrently, thereby highlighting the application prospects of TACs in the biomedical field.

         <title>Multicolor Rare&#8208;Earth Film with Ultra&#8208;Long Afterglow for Diverse Energy&#8208;Saving Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study fabricates a large&#8208;area multicolor rare&#8208;earth afterglow film via electrospinning, integrating ZnS and tricolor rare&#8208;earth phosphors to achieve ultra&#8208;long afterglow (&gt;30 h) and tunable emissions. The film exhibits thermoluminescence, environmental stability, and light&#8208;capturing capabilities, enabling applications in fire&#8208;rescue gear, greenhouses, and energy&#8208;efficient tunnel/garage lighting. Its scalable production and cost&#8208;effectiveness advance energy&#8208;saving technologies in agriculture, safety, and urban infrastructure.








Abstract
Rare&#8208;earth afterglow materials, with their unique light&#8208;storage properties, show great promise for diverse applications. However, their broader applicability is constrained by challenges such as poor solvent compatibility, limited luminescent efficiency, and monochromatic emissions. In this study, these limitations are addressed by blending ZnS with various rare&#8208;earth phosphors including (Sr0.75Ca0.25)S:Eu2+; SrAl2O4:Eu2+, Dy3+ and Sr2MgSi2O7:Eu2+, Dy3+ to modulate deep trap mechanisms and significantly enhance both the afterglow and light capture capabilities. Using electrospinning, a large&#8208;area (0.4&#160;m &#215; 3&#160;m) afterglow film is successfully fabricated with tunable colors and an extended afterglow duration exceeding 30 h. This film demonstrates thermoluminescence, enabling potential integration into fire&#8208;rescue protective clothing for enhanced emergency visibility. In greenhouse settings, it effectively supports chlorophyll synthesis and optimizes conditions for plant growth over a 24&#8208;h cycle. For tunnel and garage applications, the film captures and stores light from vehicle headlights at distances of up to 70 meters. The scalability and cost&#8208;effectiveness of this afterglow film underscore its considerable potential for real&#8208;world applications across multiple fields, marking a significant advancement in sustainable illumination technology.

         <title>Revisiting the &#8220;Stick&#8208;Slip&#8221; Process via Magnetism&#8208;Coupled Flexible Sensors with Bioinspired Ridge Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sandwich&#8208;like device for stick&#8208;slip perception is developed, featuring a deformable bioinspired ridge layer with capability of lateral deformation and fast recovery. Coupled with magnetized functionality, the morphological transformation is capable to induce periodical electrical pulses which allows to revisit the stick&#8208;slip process when human fingertip scans across a specific surface.








Abstract
&#8220;Stick&#8208;slip&#8221; phenomenon that occurs when human fingertip scans across a specific surface is essential to perceive the interactions between skin and the surface. Understanding the &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior is important for bionic flexible system in applications from advanced robotics to intelligent tactile sensors. However, it is often overlooked owing to the limitations to mimic the soft skin that can tangentially deform/recover with informative electrical feedback. Here, a sandwich&#8208;type device with deformable ridge&#8208;layer is proposed to analyze the characteristic of stick/slip states in &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; process. Specifically, it is observed that fast recovery of the sensing architecture is caused by dynamic slip phase that generates periodical signals based on principle of induction. The results experimentally show that periods of the electrical pulses are dependent on factors such as inherent properties (e.g., modulus and geometry) and operational parameters (e.g., scanning speed and normal load), which is consistent with the theoretical model. Furthermore, it is found that the transition between &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; and full slip could qualitatively reflect interfacial properties such as moisture, roughness, and topology. It is expected that the results can strengthen the understanding of &#8220;stick&#8208;slip&#8221; behavior when fingertip interacts with a surface and provide guidance of flexible sensor design to enrich the biomimetic perceptions.

         <title>Geometric Design of Interface Structures and Electrolyte Solvation Chemistry for Fast Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small&#8208;grain&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) geometry can provide sufficient paths for excellent Li+ ion supply capacity, and a soft&#8208;solvating electrolyte can enhance the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions under fast charging conditions. Isobutyronitrile&#8208;based electrolytes provide high discharge capacity during fast charging cycles while mitigating lithium plating on the anode.








Abstract
The grain sizes of solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and solvation structure of electrolytes can affect Li+ ion transport across SEI and control the desolvation kinetics of solvated Li+ ions during fast&#8208;charging of Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, the impact of the geometric structure of SEI grains on the fast charging capability of LIBs is rarely examined. Here, the correlation between the SEI grain size and fast charging characteristics of cells is explored, and the desolvation kinetics is controlled by replacing the strongly binding ethylene carbonate (EC) solvent with a weakly binding nitrile&#8208;based solvent under fast charging conditions. The evolution of small grains of SEI to provide sufficient paths for Li+ ion supply can be achieved by the modification of solvation structure in the electrolyte. Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN&#8208;containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li+ ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.

Additionally, the less resistive SEI composition and low viscosity of isoBN-containing electrolyte enable a more rapid charging of LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/graphite full cells by facilitating the SEI crossing of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions with less Li plating at a charging rate of 4 C at 25 &#176;C. This work sheds light on solvation structure and interface engineering to enhance the fast charging cycle stability of LIBs for tailorable adoption in transportation sectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Selective Growth of Ultralong Organic Phosphorescence Nanocrystals with Optimized Crystal Forms for In Vivo Optical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) nanocrystals have attracted great attention in the field of in vivo optical imaging due to their ability to effectively minimize the interference of fluorescence background from biological tissues. In this work, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is proposed for preparing UOP nanocrystals with different crystal forms for in vivo biological imaging.








Abstract
Ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials are valuable for biological imaging to avoid interference from fluorescence background signals because of their delayed emission property. Obtaining nanocrystals with high phosphorescence quantum yield is a critical factor to achieve high&#8208;quality UOP imaging. Herein, a pair of host&#8211;guest UOP doped system with variable crystal forms for the host is constructed. By exploring the relationship between the crystal form of the host and the UOP of the doped system, the importance of host crystal form is revealed to achieve high quantum yield UOP in doped systems. Furthermore, to overcome the low crystallinity and numerous defects faced by traditional bottom&#8208;up strategies for nanocrystal preparation, a strategy is proposed for the selective preparation of nanocrystals with the target crystal form. Through controlling the evaporation rate of the solvent, the ordered growth of crystals can be effectively regulated to obtain nanocrystals with different crystal forms for bioimaging applications.

         <title>Synthetic Active Liquid Crystals Powered by Acoustic Waves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully synthetic active liquid crystal, energized by an acoustic field, is presented. This system exhibits active nematic behavior, tunable topological defect dynamics, and persistent hydrodynamic vortices at high activity levels. The material maintains stable properties while enabling precise activity control in a wide range.








Abstract
Active nematic materials combine orientational order with activity at the microscopic level. Current experimental realizations of active nematics include vibrating elongated particles, cell layers, suspensions of elongated bacteria, and a mixture of bio&#8208;filaments with molecular motors. The majority of active nematics are of biological origin. The realization of a fully synthetic active liquid crystal comprised of a lyotropic chromonic liquid crystal energized by ultrasonic waves, is reported. This synthetic active liquid crystal is free from biological degradation and variability, exhibits phenomenology associated with active nematics, and enables precise and rapid activity control over a significantly extended range. It is demonstrated that the energy of the acoustic field is converted into microscopic extensile stresses disrupting long&#8208;range nematic order and giving rise to an undulation instability and proliferation of topological defects. The emergence of unconventional free&#8208;standing persistent vortices in the nematic director field at high activity levels is revealed. The results provide a foundation for the design of externally energized active liquid crystals with stable material properties and tunable topological defect dynamics crucial for the realization of reconfigurable microfluidic&#160;systems.

         <title>1D Magnetic Topological Inorganic Electrides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of 1D stable magnetic inorganic electrides are identified by high throughput screening and experimental synthesis. Furthermore, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit various applications, including spintronics, topological electronics, low work function, electron emission, and high&#8208;performance catalysts for NH3 reductions.








Abstract
Inorganic electrides, which are characterized by the presence of interstitial anionic electrons (IAEs) within distinct geometric cavities, exhibit unique properties and have garnered significant attention in various fields. Nevertheless, inorganic electrides face significant challenges in terms of their stability and magnetic topological states. To address these issues, a combination of high&#8208;throughput screening, first&#8208;principles calculations, and experimental synthesis is used to identify a series of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides with diverse properties and applications. Specifically, 17 ferromagnetic (FM) and 19 antiferromagnetic (AFM) 1D inorganic electrides, with different topological bulk and surface states are reported. Moreover, these 1D inorganic electrides exhibit lower work functions (&#8776;3&#160;eV) on the (001) surface, significantly enhancing their applications in ammonia synthesis. Further experimental synthesis and characterization suggested that 1D inorganic electrides exhibit extremely high stability owing to the strong hybridization between IAEs and atoms and the small surface area of IAEs. These findings involve the screening, investigation, preparation, and application of stable 1D magnetic topological inorganic electrides, heralding a new era in the study of 1D inorganic electrides in topological quantum science, spintronics, energy, and the corresponding interdisciplinary areas.

         <title>LiC6@Li as a Promising Substitution of Li Metal Counter Electrode for Low&#8208;Temperature Battery Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work developed a LiC6@Li counter electrode, as an alternative to Li metal for more precisely evaluating the electrochemical behavior of electrode materials at low temperatures. The low interfacial resistances facilitate preferential de&#8208;intercalation of Li+ from LiC6, resulting in a sharp decreased over&#8208;potential at low temperatures. Meanwhile, the rapid replenishment of Li+ through the solid&#8211;solid&#8208;connection reaction maintains stable LiC6@Li potential.








Abstract
Li metal, as a counter electrode, is widely used for electrode materials evaluation in coin type half&#8208;cells. However, whether this configuration is suitable for different working conditions has often been neglected. Herein, the large resistance and high cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of Li metal at low temperature are highlighted, revealing its incompetence as counter electrode on cryogenic condition. In view of this, a novel LiC6@Li composite electrode is developed as a promising substitution for electrode materials evaluation. In the LiC6@Li electrode, Li+ de&#8208;intercalated from LiC6 preferentially due to the low interface resistance of LiC6, presenting a cathodic/anodic over&#8208;potential of 0.05&#160;V (67&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2) at &#8722;20 &#176;C, which is ten times lower than that of Li metal. Moreover, the rapid lithium replenishment into LiC6 from Li metal enables a stable potential of LiC6@Li. Consequently, the LiC6@Li&#8208;based half&#8208;cells enabled more precise evaluation of the Li+ storage potential and specific capacities of a series of electrode materials at low temperature. As an extension, KC8@K is also successfully prepared as a superior counter electrode to K metal. This work proposes a suitable counter electrode for more accurately evaluating electrode materials at subfreezing scenarios, demonstrating the necessity of specialized electrode evaluation systems for particular operating conditions.

The established material and device approach enables efficient, stable blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with narrow emission and low&#8208;efficiency roll&#8208;off at high luminance.








Abstract
Marching toward next&#8208;generation ultrahigh&#8208;definition and high&#8208;resolution displays, the development of high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) with narrow emission and high luminance is essential and requires conceptual advancements in both molecular and device design. Herein, a blue organic emitter is reported that exhibits hot&#8208;exciton and aggregation&#8208;induced emission characteristics, and use it as a sensitizer in the proposed triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation (TTA)&#8208;assisted hot&#8208;exciton&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (HSF) device, abbreviated THSF. Results show that through dual&#8208;channel stepwise F&#246;rster and Dexter energy transfer processes, the THSF system can simultaneously enhance exciton utilization, accelerate exciton dynamics, and reduce the concentration of triplet excitons. The smooth management of excitons makes the overall performance of the THSF device superior to the control TTA fluorescence and HSF devices. Furthermore, a high&#8208;performance narrowband blue (CIEx,y = 0.13, 0.12) OLED is achieved using a two&#8208;unit tandem device design, providing an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency of 18.3%, a record&#8208;high L90% (the luminance where the &#414;ext drops to 90% of its peak value) of &#8776;20&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a long half&#8208;lifetime at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 initial luminance of &#8776;13&#160;256&#160;h. These results showcase the great potential of the THSF strategy in realizing efficient and stable blue OLEDs with narrow emission and high luminance.

         <dc:description>
This study presents an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) inspired by the biomechanical properties of human fingertips. The AI&#8208;LMS demonstrates superior performance in multidimensional pressure sensing, characterized by high linearity and stability. Potential applications encompass enhancing robotic tactile perception and facilitating precise 3D surface scanning, representing a significant milestone in the field of soft robotics technology.








Abstract
The advancement of robotic behavior and intelligence has led to an urgent demand for improving their sensitivity and interactive capabilities, which presents challenges in achieving multidimensional, wide&#8208;ranging, and reliable tactile sensing. Here an anisotropic inductive liquid metal sensor (AI&#8208;LMS) is introduced inspired by the human fingertip, which inherently possesses the capability to detect spatially multi&#8208;axis pressure with a wide sensing range, exceptional linearity, and signal stability. Additionally, it can detect very small pressures and responds swiftly to prescribed forces. Compared to resistive signals, inductive signals offer significant advantages. Further, integrated with a deep neural network model, the AI&#8208;LMS can decouple multi&#8208;axis pressures acting simultaneously upon it. Notably, the sensing range of Ecoflex and PDMS&#8208;based AI&#8208;LMS can be expanded by a factor of 4 and 9.5, respectively. For practical illustrations, a high&#8208;precision surface scanning reconstruction system is developed capable of capturing intricate details of 3D surface profiles. The utilization of biomimetic AI&#8208;LMS as robotic fingertips enables real&#8208;time discrimination of diverse delicate grasping behaviors across different fingers. The innovations and unique features in sensing mechanisms and structural design are expected to bring transformative changes and find extensive applications in the field of soft robotics.

         <title>Durable Proton Exchange Membrane Based on Polymers of Intrinsic Microporosity for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel composite proton exchange membrane (PEM) design that leverages carboxylic acid&#8208;functionalized polymers of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Harnessing Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions enables the development of a synergistic microporous structure that confines phosphoric acid clusters, enhancing proton conductivity and durability. This work addresses critical challenges in PEM development, while proposing a solutionfor&#160;the design of next&#8208;generation membranes.









Abstract
High&#8208;temperature proton exchange membrane fuel cells (HT&#8208;PEMFCs) is regarded as a promising energy conversion system owing to simplified water management and enhanced tolerance to fuel impurities. However, phosphoric acid (PA) leaching remains a critical issue, diminishing energy density and durability, posing significant obstacle to the commercial development of HT&#8208;PEMFCs. To address this, composite membranes incorporating the carboxylic acid&#8208;modified polymer of intrinsic microporosity (cPIM&#8208;1) are designed as framework polymer, blended with polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) for HT&#8208;PEMFCs. The Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions between cPIM&#8208;1 and PVP created an extensive hydrogen&#8208;bonding network, improving membrane compatibility. The optimized microporous structure and multiple anchoring sites gave rise to &#8220;domain&#8208;limited&#8221; PA clusters, enhancing the capillary effect. Simultaneously, improved hydrophobicity synergistically optimizes catalytic interface, promoting continuous and stable proton transfer. The HT&#8208;PEMFCs based on PVP/cPIM&#8208;1 composite membrane achieved a peak power density of 1090.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 160&#160;&#176;C, representing a 152% improvement compared to PVP/PES membrane. Additionally, it demonstrated excellent durability, with a voltage decay of 0.058&#160;mV&#160;h&#8722;1 over 210&#160;h of accelerated stress test corresponds to more than 5000&#160;h of constant current density durability test. This study presents a promising strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance and durable novel membranes in various energy conversion systems.

         <title>Critical Roles of Ultrafast Energy Funnelling and Ultrafast Singlet&#8208;Triplet Annihilation in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Optical Gain Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast broadband photoluminescence spectroscopy provides insights into the lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation in mixed&#8208;layer quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. Rapid energy funnelling to the sites of amplified spontaneous emission occurs within sub&#8208;picosecond timescales. However, the accumulation of triplet excitons effectively quenches incoming singlet excitons, creating a bottleneck in the energy cascade and hindering the development of population inversion.









Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (Q2D) perovskite possess considerable potential for light emission and amplification technologies. Recently, mixed films containing Q2D perovskite grains with varying layer thicknesses have shown great promise as carrier concentrators, effectively mitigating trap&#8208;mediated recombination. In this strategy, photo&#8208;excitations are rapidly funnelled down an energy gradient to the thickest grains, leading to amplified spontaneous emission (ASE). However, the quantum&#8208;confined Q2D slabs also stabilize the formation of unwanted triplet excitons, resulting in parasitic quenching of emissive singlet states. Here, a novel ultrafast photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to study photoexcitation dynamics in mixed&#8208;layer Q2D perovskites. By analysing spectra with high temporal and energy resolution, this is found that sub&#8208;picosecond energy transfer to ASE sites is accompanied by excitation losses due to triplet formation on grains with small and intermediate thicknesses. Further accumulation of triplets creates a bottleneck in the energy cascade, effectively quenching incoming singlet excitons. This ultrafast annihilation within 200 femtosecond outpaces energy transfer to ASE sites, preventing the build&#8208;up of population inversion. This study highlights the significance of investigating photoexcitation dynamics on ultrafast timescales, encompassing lasing dynamics, energy transfer, and singlet&#8208;triplet annihilation, to gain crucial insights into the photophysics of the optical gain process in Q2D perovskites.

A single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) is fabricated using a dry fibrillation method, enabling exceptional thermal stability, low energy consumption, and full material utilization. Sulfonate functional groups enhance interfacial stability, significantly improving cycling in graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells. This scalable, sustainable approach paves the way for next&#8208;generation functional separators.








Abstract
Separators are critical components in lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), preventing internal short circuits, mitigating thermal runaway, and influencing rate capability and cycling performance. However, current polyolefin separators suffer from limitations, such as high thermal shrinkage, relatively poor wettability, and inadequate long&#8208;term stability, impacting safety and cycle life in critical applications like electric vehicles. Here, a single&#8208;layer lignin&#8208;based ultrathin separator (as thin as 15&#160;&#181;m) with exceptional intrinsic thermal stability and cycling performance is demonstrated. The separator is fabricated using lignosulfonate, a natural polymer derived as a byproduct of chemical pulping and biorefinery processes. By employing a dry fibrillation method, the process achieves low energy consumption and a 100% raw material conversion rate, highlighting its scalability and sustainability. Interfacial studies reveal the improved cycling performance in both graphite||NMC811 and Si&#8208;Gr||NMC811 cells is attributed to the abundant sulfonate functional groups in lignosulfonates, which promote the formation of a sulfur&#8208;rich cathode/solid electrolyte interphases (CEI/SEI) with low resistance in both the cathode and anode. The high thermal stability, manufacturing feasibility, battery performance, and low cost of such lignin&#8208;based separators offer new inspiration for developing next&#8208;generation, single&#8208;layer functional separators tailored for high&#8208;performance LIBs.

         <title>Universally Applicable and Ultra&#8208;Long Life Cyclic Power Generation Induced by Interfacial Ion&#8208;Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electric power generating cell is developed based on potential difference driven reversible ion migration, which generates ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month with a high short&#8208;circuit of over 40&#160;mA and output power density of up to 6&#160;W m&#8722;2, surpassing the values reported for many other sorts of typical electricity generators.









Abstract
Sustainable energy supply without relying on external power sources is one of the bottlenecks in achieving self&#8208;supportive wearable electronics and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) systems. Here a new type of universally applicable and ultra&#8208;long life cyclic power generation is developed induced by interfacial redox reaction&#8208;mediated ion&#8208;oscillation, which can provide cycling electric energy in a self&#8208;charging manner without extra pre&#8208;charge. Based on asymmetric manganese dioxide and molybdenum disulfide electrode pairs, the proof&#8208;concept electric potential difference power generating cell (EPDC) offers ultra&#8208;long life electric output over 8&#8208;month testing period for tens of thousands of cycles. A layer&#8208;stacking EPDC unit supplies a high direct current of more than 40&#160;mA and a power density of &#8776;6&#160;W m&#8722;2. Such recyclable power&#8208;generating process mainly relies on reversible ion migration at an asymmetric interface in response to relative variation of electric potentials. The universal applicability of EPDC is validated by a combination of diverse electrode pairs. Large&#8208;scale manufacture of EPDCs is achievable by industry&#8208;compatible auto&#8208;blade coating technology with on&#8208;demand power output, providing a long&#8208;acting power supply platform for self&#8208;charging electronic systems.

         <title>Interfacial Adsorption Layers Based on Amino Acid Analogues to Enable Dual Stabilization toward Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interfacial adsorption layers based on N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) are constructed to inhibit Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle by employing an electrolyte additive strategy. These layers stabilize Zn anode via creating a &#8220;H2O&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane (IHP) and buffering the interfacial pH, while hindering polyiodide migration at the I2 cathode through ion&#8211;dipole interactions. Attributing to these benefits, a long&#8208;lasting aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 battery is realized.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries are promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the merits of low cost and high safety. However, their commercial application is hindered by Zn corrosion and polyiodide shuttle at I2 cathode. Herein, N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)glycine (BHEG) based interfacial adsorption layers are constructed to stabilize Zn anodes and mitigate polyiodide shuttle according to ion&#8211;dipole interactions, by using a strategy of electrolyte additive. The tertiary amine (N(CH2)3) and carboxyl (&#9472;COO&#8722;) groups in the deprotonated BHEG can reversibly capture H+ and dynamically neutralize OH&#8722; ions, efficiently buffering the interfacial pH of Zn metal anodes and suppressing hydrogen evolution reactions. Additionally, the BHEG adsorption layers can repel 39.3% of H2O molecules at the Zn interface, creating a &#8220;water&#8208;deficient&#8221; inner Helmholtz plane and preventing Zn corrosion. Significantly, the N(CH2)3 groups in BHEG also inhibit polyiodide shuttle at the I2 cathode, which exhibits high adsorption energies of &#8722;0.88, &#8722;0.41, and &#8722;0.39&#160;eV for I&#8722;, I2, and I3&#8722;, respectively. Attributing to these benefits, the Zn&#8211;I2 battery can achieve a high areal capacity of 2.99 mAh cm&#8722;2 and an extended cycling life of 2,000 cycles, even at a high mass loading of I2 cathode (&#8776;21.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2).

Abstract
Organohydrogels have significant applications in numerous fields. The current synthetic strategies generally rely on the intricate and complex design of lipophilic or hydrophilic polymers to achieve the goal of oil&#8208;water interpenetration.

The sub&#8208;nanowires in the oil phase provide structural support, while surfactants in the sub&#8208;nanowires exist at the interface between oil and water, thus forming the water&#8208;in&#8208;oil structure. The organohydrogels possess commendable mechanical properties, an inherent self&#8208;healing ability, and a specific temperature&#8208;responsive behavior. Moreover, the organohydrogels are compatible with a variety of organic solvents and polymers, reserving the promise for wide&#8208;range applications in the future.

         <title>Nose&#8208;to&#8208;Brain Delivery of Circular RNA SCMH1&#8208;Loaded Lipid Nanoparticles for Ischemic Stroke Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and safe circular&#8208;RNA delivery system circSCMH1@LNP1 is developed for direct nose&#8208;to&#8208;brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly accumulates in the peri&#8208;infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.








Abstract
Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long&#8208;term outcomes for post&#8208;stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post&#8208;stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle circSCMH1@LNP1 is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of circSCMH1@LNP1 significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri&#8208;infarct region and reduces its non&#8208;specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that circSCMH1@LNP1 promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post&#8208;stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post&#8208;stroke brain injury. It is envisioned that this study may bridge a crucial gap between basic research and translational application, paving the way for clinical implementation of novel circSCMH1 in post&#8208;stroke patient management.

&lt;p&gt;An efficient and safe circular-RNA delivery system &lt;b&gt;circSCMH1@LNP1&lt;/b&gt; is developed for direct nose-to-brain delivery of circRNA SCMH1 to ischemic lesions. Experiments demonstrate that intranasally administrated &lt;b&gt;circSCMH1@LNP1&lt;/b&gt; significantly accumulates in the peri-infarct region of PT stroke mice, thereby improving functional recovery by enhancing synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ischemic stroke represents one of the leading cerebrovascular diseases with a high rate of mortality and disability globally. To date, there are no effective clinical drugs available to improve long-term outcomes for post-stroke patients. A novel nucleic acid agent circSCMH1 which can promote sensorimotor function recovery in rodent and nonhuman primate animal stroke models has been found. However, there are still delivery challenges to overcome for its clinical implementation. Besides, its effects on post-stroke cognitive functions remain unexplored. Herein, lipid nanoparticle &lt;b&gt;circSCMH1@LNP1&lt;/b&gt; is established to deliver circSCMH1 and explore its therapeutic efficacy comprehensively. Distribution experiments demonstrate that intranasal administration of &lt;b&gt;circSCMH1@LNP1&lt;/b&gt; significantly increases circSCMH1 distribution in the peri-infarct region and reduces its non-specific accumulation in other organs compared to intravenous injection. Therapeutic results indicate that &lt;b&gt;circSCMH1@LNP1&lt;/b&gt; promotes synaptic plasticity, vascular repair, neuroinflammation relief, and myelin sheath formation, thereby achieving enhanced sensorimotor and cognitive function recovery in post-stroke mice. In conclusion, this research presents a simple and effective LNP system for efficient delivery of circSCMH1 via intranasal administration to repair post-stroke brain injury.

         <title>Self&#8208;Regulating the Local Conjugation of Tertiary Aniline toward Highly Stable Polymer Li Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thermo&#8208;electrochemically compatible polymer electrolyte is proposed with a locally conjugated structure through self&#8208;regulation of paired tertiary anilines coupled with in situ polymerization, which significantly reconstructs an improved Li+ solvation and enhances electrode/electrolyte interfacial stability of LMBs. This concept provides an important theoretical basis and technical means for achieving practical high energy/power density LMBs.








Abstract
Pursuing high energy/power density lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with good safety and lifespan is essential for developing next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices. Nevertheless, the uncontrollable degradation of the electrolyte and the subsequent formation of inferior electrolyte/electrode interfaces present formidable challenges to this endeavor, especially when paring with transition metal oxide cathode. Herein, a fireproof polymeric matrix with a local conjugated structure is constructed by 4,4&#8242;&#8208;methylenebis (N, N&#8208;diglycidylaniline) (NDA) monomer via in situ polymerization, which promotes the use of ester&#8208;based liquid electrolyte for highly stable LMBs. The conjugated tertiary anilines in this PNDA electrolyte effectively tune the Li+ solvation sheath and generate conformal protective layers on the electrode surfaces, resulting in excellent compatibility with both high&#8208;voltage cathodes and Li&#8208;metal anodes. Moreover, the accumulated electron density endows PNDA with a powerful capability to seize and eliminate the corrosive hydrofluoric acid, which strikingly mitigates the irreversible structure transformation of LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 (NMC) particles. As a result, the PNDA&#8208;based Li||LiFePO4 and Li||NMC cells reach excellent electrochemical and safety performance. This study provides a promising strategy for the macromolecular design of electrolytes and emphasizes the importance of &#8220;local conjugation&#8221; within the polymers for LMBs.

         <title>A Strain Relaxation Modulation for Printing High&#8208;performance Flexible Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of flexible organic solar cells. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. Thus, these provide the potential for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in organic photovoltaics.








Abstract
The rational toughening of photosensitive films is crucial for the development of robust and flexible organic solar cells (F&#8208;OSCs), which are always influenced by mechanical strain and thermodynamic relaxation within the films. Nevertheless, the potential determinants of these properties and quantitative metrics modulating the overall performance of flexible devices have not been thoroughly defined. Herein, a fine&#8208;grain strengthening strategy is demonstrated for mitigating the excessive aggregation or crystallization in small&#8208;molecule acceptor films, the secondary thermal relaxation of side chains in polyethylene oxide (PEO) local motion restricts the free fluctuation volume through hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions, thereby suppressing the non&#8208;ideal thermodynamic behavior and residual&#8208;enriched state. These contribute to an increase in yield strength and a reduction in microcracks while enhancing the fracture energy at the donor/acceptor interface. Finally, the optimal F&#8208;OSCs demonstrate champion PCEs of 19.12% (0.04 cm2) and 16.92% (1.00 cm2), and maintain 80% of their initial efficiency after heating at 85 &#176;C for 2600&#160;h. Besides, the flexibility and mechanical robustness of devices are also optimized, the elastic modulus and stiffness are decreased by 50.68% and 5.71%. This work provides interesting references for the synergistic enhancement of efficiency, mechanical and environmental stability in flexible organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolyte with Compatible Cathode&#8208;Electrolyte Interfacial Design Enabling Lithium Metal Batteries Operation at 4.8&#160;V with Long Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduce a novel approach to enhancing cathode&#8208;SPE compatibility by utilizing the same poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material in both the SPE and the cathode binder. A modified biomass&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with highly negatively charged C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is incorporated into the SPE to improve Li+ migration and strengthen its mechanical properties. The Li||LiFePO&#8324; cell, assembled via in situ photopolymerization, demonstrate stable cycling for over 1100 cycles, while the Li||NCM811 cell operated reliably at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.8 V for 100 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) with solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) offer higher energy density and enhance safety compared to the Li&#8208;ion batteries that use a graphite anode and organic electrolytes. However, achieving long cycle life for LMBs while enabling the use of high&#8208;voltage cathodes required the compatibility between cathode&#8208;SPE, rather than focusing solely on the individual components. This study presente a dual&#8208;functional poly(ionic liquid) (PolyIL)&#8208;based material that simultaneously serves as an SPE matrix and a cathode binder, constructing a cathode&#8208;SPE interface with exceptional (electro)chemical compatibility owing to the high ionic conductivity and wide electrochemical stability window. Additionally, a modified cellulose acetate (CA)&#8208;based PolyIL substrate, enriched with C&#9552;O and &#9472;OH groups, is designed rationally and incorporated to assist the Li+ migration, leveraging their highly negative charge, and enhancing the mechanical strength of the SPE. Furthermore, an in situ polymerization approach is employed to assemble the cells, improving the physical compatibility at the cathode&#8208;SPE interface. As a result, the Li||LFP cell demonstrate stable cycling beyond 1100 cycles, and the Li||NCM811 cell reliably operates at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of up to 4.8&#160;V.

         <title>2D Rhodium&#8208;Isocyanide Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rhodium&#8208;carbon coordination&#8208;based 2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra&#8208;narrow bandgaps (0.10&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm2&#8201;V&#8722;1&#8201;s&#8722;1 via time&#8208;resolved terahertz spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal&#8208;organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal&#8208;heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal&#8211;nitrogen, metal&#8211;oxygen, and metal&#8211;sulfur); synthesis of metal&#8208;carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium&#8211;carbon (Rh&#8211;C) coordination&#8208;based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node.

&lt;p&gt;Rhodium-carbon coordination-based 2D metal-organic frameworks are rationally synthesized and exhibit ultra-narrow bandgaps (0.10&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) and intrinsic charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; via time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D metal-organic frameworks (2D MOFs) are emerging organic van der Waals materials with great potential in various applications owing to their structural diversity, and tunable optoelectronic properties. So far, most reported 2D MOFs rely on metal-heteroatom coordination (e.g., metal&#8211;nitrogen, metal&#8211;oxygen, and metal&#8211;sulfur); synthesis of metal-carbon coordination based 2D MOFs remains a formidable challenge. This study reports the rhodium&#8211;carbon (Rh&#8211;C) coordination-based 2D MOFs, using isocyanide as the ligand and Rh(I) as metal node. The synthesized MOFs show excellent crystallinity with quasi-square lattice networks. These MOFs show ultra-narrow bandgaps (0.1&#8211;0.28&#160;eV) resulting from the interaction between Rh(I) and isocyano groups. Terahertz spectroscopy demonstrates exceptional short-range charge mobilities up to 560 &#177;&#160;46 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#8201;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in the as-synthesized MOFs. Moreover, these MOFs are used as electrocatalysts for nitrogen reduction reaction and show an excellent NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 56.0 &#177;&#160;1.5&#160;&#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a record Faradaic efficiency of 87.1 &#177;&#160;1.8%. In situ experiments reveal dual pathways involving Rh(I) during the catalytic process. This work represents a pioneering step toward 2D MOFs based on metal&#8211;carbon coordination and paves the way for novel reticular materials with ultra-high carrier mobility and for versatile optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Revealing the Coordination and Mediation Mechanism of Arylboronic Acids Toward Energy&#8208;Dense Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arylboronic acids are explored for use in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries. The theoretically and experimentally verified coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids can not only stabilize the anode interface but also accelerate the sluggish sulfur conversion. 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) is chosen as a suitable electrolyte modifier, significantly improving the electrochemical performance of Li&#9472;S batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#9472;S) batteries offer a promising avenue for the next generation of energy&#8208;dense batteries. However, it is quite challenging to realize practical Li&#9472;S batteries under limited electrolytes and high sulfur loading, which may exacerbate problems of interface deterioration and low sulfur utilization. Herein, the coordination and mediation chemistry of arylboronic acids that enable energy&#8208;dense and long&#8208;term&#8208;cycling Li&#9472;S batteries is proposed. The coordination chemistry between NO3&#8722; and arylboronic acids breaks the resonance configuration of NO3&#8722; and thermodynamically promotes its reduction on the anode, contributing to a mechanically robust interface. The mediation chemistry between lithium arylborate and polysulfides distorts S&#9472;S/Li&#9472;S bonds, alters the rate&#8208;determining step from Li2S4&#8594;Li2S2 to Li2S6&#8594;Li2S4, and homogeneously accelerates the sulfur redox kinetics. Li&#9472;S batteries using 3,5&#8208;bis(trifluoromethyl)phenylboronic acid (BPBA) show excellent cycling stability (1000 cycles with a low capacity decay rate of 0.033% per cycle) and a high energy density of 422&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under aggressive chemical environments (high sulfur loading of 17.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte operation of 3.6&#160;mL gS&#8722;1). The basic mechanism of coordination and mediation chemistry can be extended to other arylboronic acids with different configurations and compositions, thus broadening the application prospect of arylboronic acids in the electrolyte engineering of Li&#9472;S batteries.

         <title>Unlocking Multimodal Nonlinear Microscopy for Deep&#8208;Tissue Imaging under Continuous&#8208;Wave Excitation with Tunable Upconverting Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a multimodal nonlinear microscopy approach using upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs) under continuous&#8208;wave excitation. The UCNPs exhibit high&#8208;order nonlinear optical responses, enabling deep&#8208;tissue 3D imaging, video&#8208;rate wide&#8208;field imaging, and depth&#8208;selective photomodulation. High&#8208;resolution in vivo imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks is demonstrated, highlighting the potential for cost&#8208;effective bioimaging and targeted phototherapy applications.








Abstract
Nonlinear microscopy provides excellent depth penetration and axial sectioning for 3D imaging, yet widespread adoption is limited by reliance on expensive ultrafast pulsed lasers. This work circumvents such limitations by employing rare&#8208;earth doped upconverting nanoparticles (UCNPs), specifically Yb3+/Tm3+ co&#8208;doped NaYF4 nanocrystals, which exhibit strong multimodal nonlinear optical responses under continuous&#8208;wave (CW) excitation. These UCNPs emit multiple wavelengths at UV (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), blue (&#955; &#8776; 450 nm), and NIR (&#955; &#8776; 800 nm), whose intensities are nonlinearly governed by excitation power. Exploiting these properties, multi&#8208;colored nonlinear emissions enable functional imaging of cerebral blood vessels in deep brain. Using a simple optical setup, high resolution in vivo 3D imaging of mouse cerebrovascular networks at depths up to 800 &#181;mm is achieved, surpassing performance of conventional imaging methods using CW lasers. In vivo cerebrovascular flow dynamics is also visualized with wide&#8208;field video&#8208;rate imaging under low&#8208;powered CW excitation. Furthermore, UCNPs enable depth&#8208;selective, 3D&#8208;localized photo&#8208;modulation through turbid media, presenting spatiotemporally targeted light beacons. This innovative approach, leveraging UCNPs' intrinsic nonlinear optical characteristics, significantly advances multimodal nonlinear microscopy with CW lasers, opening new opportunities in bio&#8208;imaging, remote optogenetics, and photodynamic therapy.

         <title>Establishing Nanoscale Circuitry by Designing a Structure with Atomic Short&#8208;range Order for High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microsized perovskite oxide Ce0.266W0.1Nb0.9O3 is engineered as an anode material for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;life Li+ storage, demonstrating impressive performance by maintaining both high areal capacity and high rate capability, even at high mass loadings. This outstanding electrochemical behavior is primarily attributed to the nanoscale circuitry formed by an atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order structure.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate materials necessitate the rapid transportation of both electrons and ions, a requirement that becomes especially challenging at practical mass loadings (&gt;10 mg cm2). To address this challenge, a material is designed with an architecture having atomic&#8208;scale short&#8208;range order. This design establishes internal nanoscale circuitry at the particle level, which facilitates rapid electronic and ionic transport within micrometer&#8208;sized niobium tungsten oxides. The architecture features alternating cerium&#8208;depleted and cerium&#8208;enriched regions. The continuous cerium&#8208;enriched regions with enhanced conductivity provide multilane highways for electron mobility by functioning as electron&#8208;conducting wires that significantly boost the overall conductivity. The cerium&#8208;depleted regions effectively mitigate electrostatic repulsion and promote rapid ion transport through ion&#8208;conducting channels. These structural characteristics provide a continuous network that supports both electrical migration and chemical diffusion to amplify the areal capacity and rate capability even at high mass loadings. These findings not only expand the fundamental understanding of the design of optimal host lattices for advanced energy storage systems but also of the practical application of microsized high&#8208;rate electrode materials.

         <title>Regulating Interfacial H2O Activity and H2 Bubbles by Core/Shell Nanoarrays for 800 h Stable Alkaline Seawater Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve activity and stability for seawater electrolysis under high current densities, the problems of firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles with core/shell nanoarrays, addressed which further regulates the interfacial H2O activity to reduce overpotentials, hence highlighting its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible application for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production.








Abstract
The catalytic activity and stability under high current densities for hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) are impeded by firm adherence and coverage of H2 bubbles to the catalytic sites. Herein, we systematically synthesize core/shell nanoarrays to engineer bubble transport channels, which further remarkably regulate interfacial H2O activity, and swift H2 bubble generation and release. The self&#8208;supported catalyst holds uniform ultra&#8208;low Ru active sites of 0.38&#160;wt% and promotes the rapid formation of plentiful small H2 bubbles, which are rapidly released by the upright channels, mitigating the blockage of active sites and avoiding surface damage from bubble movements. As a result, these core/shell nanoarrays achieve ultralow overpotentials of 18 and 24 mV to reach 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1 M KOH freshwater and seawater, respectively. Additionally, the assembled electrolyzer demonstrates stable durability over 800 hours with a high current density of 2 A cm&#8722;2 in 1 M KOH seawater. The techno&#8208;economic analysis (TEA) indicates that the unit cost of the hydrogen production system is nearly half of the DOE's (Department of Energy) 2026 target. Our work addresses the stability challenges of HER and highlights its potential as a sustainable and economically feasible solution for large&#8208;scale hydrogen production of seawater.

         <title>Linear Dielectric Polymers with Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Crystals for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reveals the pivotal role of ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals in boosting the high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage of polynorbornene dielectrics. This distinctive characteristic enables the polymers to exhibit an impressive high&#8208;temperature discharge energy density of 6.76 J cm&#8722;3, even under electric fields that are far below their Weibull breakdown strength.








Abstract
Achieving optimal capacitive energy storage performance necessitates the integration of high energy storage density, typical of ferroelectric dielectrics, with the low polarization loss associated with linear dielectrics. However, combining these characteristics in a single dielectric material is challenging due to the inherent contradictions between the spontaneous polarization of ferroelectric dielectrics and the adaptability of linear dielectrics to changes in the electric field. To address this issue, a linear isotactic sulfonylated polynorbornene dielectric characterized by ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals has been developed. The sulfonyl dipoles in the ferroelectric&#8208;like crystals are oriented in the same direction, thereby enabling this polymer to exhibit a considerable dielectric constant (7.5) at room temperature. Notably, when the operating temperature surpasses the polymer's glass transition temperature (Tg &#8776; 140 &#176;C), its dielectric constant rises to 12 with just minor changes in the dissipation factor. At 150 &#176;C, 90% efficiency of the discharge energy density reaches as high as 6.76 J&#160;cm&#8722;1 under a low electric field of 320 MV m&#8722;1, which is ten times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art, high&#8208;temperature, capacitor&#8208;grade polyetherimide. The enhancement of high&#8208;temperature capacitive performance, achieved by utilizing the crystallinity of isotactic polymers to form a polar structure, presents a new perspective for the design of high&#8208;temperature dielectric polymers.

         <title>TREM2 scFv&#8208;Engineering Escherichia coli Displaying Modulation of Macrophages to Boost Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is designed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy.








Abstract
Preoperative neoadjuvant radio&#8208;chemotherapy is a cornerstone in the treatment of low rectal cancer, yet its effectiveness can be limited by the insensitivity of some patients, profoundly impacting their quality of life. Through preliminary research, it is found that TREM2+ macrophages play a pivotal role in the non&#8208;responsiveness to immunotherapy. To address this challenge, a novel ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive delivery system is developed for the precise expression of anti&#8208;TREM2 single&#8208;chain antibody fragments (scFv) using an engineered probiotic, Escherichia coli Nissle 1917 (EcN), to modulate immunotherapy. The released anti&#8208;TREM2 scFv can be precisely targeted and delivered to the tumor site via the engineered EcN outer membrane vesicles (OMVs), thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and enhancing tumor therapeutic efficiency when used in combination with the &#945;PD&#8208;L1 immune checkpoint inhibitor. Additionally, these engineered bacteria can be further modified to enhance the intestinal colonization capabilities through oral administration, thereby regulating the gut microbiota and its metabolic byproducts. Consequently, the ionizing radiation&#8208;responsive drug delivery system based on the engineered bacteria not only introduces a promising new therapeutic option for low rectal cancer but also showcases the potential to finely tune immune responses within the intricate tumor microenvironment, paving the way for innovative strategies in tumor radio&#8208;immunotherapy.

Implantable devices rely on batteries that demand surgical replacement, posing risks, and financial burdens. Ultrasound energy transfer (US&#8208;ET) offers a revolutionary wireless alternative but struggles with efficiency. The presented dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric&#8208;boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) is thin, flexible, and biocompatible that provides high&#8208;efficiency and stable power delivery in curved positions, fostering a future of noninvasive and sustainable wireless energy transfer solutions for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Wireless powering of rechargeable&#8208;implantable medical devices presents a challenge in developing reliable wireless energy transfer systems that meet medical safety and standards. Ultrasound&#8208;driven triboelectric nanogenerators (US&#8208;TENG) are investigated for various medical applications, including noninvasive percutaneous wireless battery powering to reduce the need for multiple surgeries for battery replacement. However, these devices often suffer from inefficiency due to limited output performance and rigidity. To address this issue, a dielectric&#8208;ferroelectric boosted US&#8208;TENG (US&#8208;TENGDF&#8208;B) capable of producing a high output charge with low&#8208;intensity ultrasound and a long probe distance is developed, comparatively. The feasibility and output stability of this deformable and augmented device is confirmed under various bending conditions, making it suitable for use in the body's curved positions or with electronic implants. The device achieved an output of &#8776;26&#160;V and &#8776;6.7&#160;mW output for remote charging of a rechargeable battery at a 35&#160;mm distance. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the output&#8208;augmented US&#8208;TENG for deep short&#8208;term wireless charging of implantable electronics with flexing conditions in curved devices such as future total artificial hearts.

         <title>Ultraviolet Optoelectronic Synapse Based on AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN Heterojunction for Advanced Artificial Vision Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have developed a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on&#8208;chip sensing and computing.








Abstract
Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi&#8208;state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two&#8208;terminal AlScN/p&#8208;i&#8208;n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p&#8208;GaN hetero&#8208;interface for multi&#8208;state modulation.

&lt;p&gt;Researchers have developed a two-terminal AlScN/p-i-n GaN heterojunction ferroelectric memristor with ultraviolet photoelectric synapse function, enabling nonvolatile memory and optoelectronic synaptic characteristics. This innovation achieves a high memory on/off ratio and a relatively low synaptic energy consumption, advancing optoelectronics and artificial vision systems with potential applications in on-chip sensing and computing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ferroelectric materials represent a frontier in semiconductor research, offering the potential for novel optoelectronics. AlScN material is a kind of outstanding ferroelectric semiconductor with strong residual polarization, high Curie temperature, and mainstream semiconductor fabrication compatibility. However, it is challenging to realize multi-state optical responders due to their limited light sensitivity. Here, a two-terminal AlScN/p-i-n GaN heterojunction ultraviolet optoelectronic synapse is fabricated, overcoming this limitation by leveraging hole capture at the AlScN/p-GaN hetero-interface for multi-state modulation. The novel structure maintains excellent memristor characteristics based on the ferroelectric of AlScN, realizing an on/off ratio of 9.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. More importantly, the device can mimic synaptic characteristics essential for artificial vision systems, achieving an image recognition accuracy of 93.7% with a weight evolution nonlinearity of 0.26. This approach not only extends the applications of AlScN in optoelectronics but also paves the way for advanced artificial vision systems with image preprocessing and recognition capabilities. The findings provide a step forward in the development of non-volatile memories with potential for on-chip sensing and computing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Photoelectrocatalytic Synthesis of Ammonia by Superionic Conductor with Mixed Ion/Electron Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) with enhanced mixed electronic/ionic conductivity is applied for solar&#8208;driven nitrate conversion to ammonia. The migration of mobile lithium ions between layers significantly promotes the electronic conductivity of FePS2.66Li0.87 SIC, which achieves a remarkable ammonia synthesis yield (134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1) under low bias voltage.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) nitrate reduction shows substantial potential for solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia (NH3) conversion. However, low electron density and disordered electron conduction of conventional catalysts result in limited performance and low Faraday efficiency. Herein, a FePS2.66Li0.87 superionic conductor (SIC) is developed by introducing lithium ions into van der Waals immobile layered of FePS3 catalyst. This layered crystal framework facilitates high&#8208;concentration lithium ions confinement and long&#8208;range diffusion at room temperature, transitioning the conduction mechanism from electronic to mixed ionic/electronic. The typical nanofluidic ion transport leads to a high ionic conductivity of 16.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature and enhanced electronic conductivity of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, mobile lithium ions within interlayers enhance the interaction between the low&#8208;lying 3dyz orbitals of Fe interacting with 2a2 empty antibonding orbitals of NO3&#8722;. An excellent PEC ammonia production of 134.18&#160;&#181;mol cm&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with 96.95% Faradaic efficiency is achieved, and the corresponding solar&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 efficiency of 57.13% offers a promising pathway toward sustainable ammonia production.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Porous Polyamide&#8208;Imide Membrane for Switchable Emulsion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel amphiphilic polymer Torlon&#8208;based membrane with switchable superwettability is developed using a simple one&#8208;step phase separation method. Its hierarchical porous structure and surface reorganization enable exceptional oil&#8208;water separation with ultrahigh permeance and efficiency. The membrane exhibits excellent antifouling, self&#8208;cleaning, and durability, offering a scalable solution for advanced oily wastewater treatment and beyond.








Abstract
The development of advanced membranes with switchable superwettability has attracted considerable attention for the efficient treatment of oily wastewater. However, challenges persist in designing and fabricating such membranes through straightforward methods. In this study, a novel strategy is presented to design switchable superwettable membranes based on micro/nano&#8208;structured porous surfaces and surface chemical composition reorganization. A commercial amphiphilic polymer, polyamide&#8208;imide (Torlon), is fabricated into a porous symmetric membrane with a hierarchical surface structure using a one&#8208;step non&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced phase separation method. By leveraging the surface reorganization capability of amphiphilic polymers and the hierarchically porous structure, the resulting membranes demonstrate exceptional superamphiphilicity in air, underwater superoleophobicity, and underoil superhydrophobicity. These properties enable ultrahigh permeance and separation efficiency for oil&#8208;in&#8208;water, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil, and crude oil/water emulsions through a gravity&#8208;driven process, eliminating the need for external energy. Furthermore, the membranes exhibit excellent antifouling and self&#8208;cleaning performance, maintaining stable operation over multiple cycles. This work provides an innovative and scalable approach to next&#8208;generation switchable superwettable membranes with broad potential applications in oily wastewater treatment and beyond.

         <title>A Natural Lignification Inspired Super&#8208;Hard Wood&#8208;Based Composites with Extreme Resilience</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 19, May 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) are designed and developed inspired by the mesoscale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth. This innovative hybrid structure is achieved by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression.








Abstract
The growing demand for high&#8208;strength, durable materials capable of enduring extreme environments presents a significant challenge, particularly in balancing performance with sustainability. Conventional materials such as alloys and ceramics are nonrenewable, expensive, and require energy&#8208;intensive production processes. Here, super&#8208;hard wood&#8208;based composites (WBC) inspired by the meso&#8208;scale homogeneous lignification process intrinsic to tree growth are designed and developed. This hybrid structure is achieved innovatively by leveraging the infusion of low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenol formaldehyde resin into the cell walls of thin wood slices, followed by a unique multi&#8208;layer construction and high&#8208;temperature compression. The resulting composite exhibits remarkable properties, including a Janka hardness of 24&#160;382&#160;N and a Brinell hardness of 40.7&#160;HB, along with exceptional antipiercing performance. The created super&#8208;hard, sustainable materials address the limitations of nonrenewable resources while providing enhanced protection, structural stability, and exceptional resilience. The WBC approach aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by offering extra values for improving personal safety and building integrity across various engineering applications.

Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries
In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post&#8208;diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models. It encompasses an analysis of natural and synthetic biomaterials, along with crosslinking methods to improve structural integrity. Also, it critically evaluates current 3D bioprinted GBM models and their integration into GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platforms, which hold noteworthy potential for drug screening and personalized therapies. A versatile development framework grounded on Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design principles is proposed to guide the design of bioprinting models. Future perspectives, including 4D bioprinting and machine learning approaches, are discussed, along with the current gaps to advance the field further.

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next-generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT-driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field-free switching through out-of-plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-polarized spins with high charge-to-spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large-scale production. This study demonstrates field-free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type-II Dirac semimetal Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3v&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; symmetry, leading to significant &lt;i&gt;z&lt;/i&gt;-polarized spin accumulation in the Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low-power, high-density spintronic memory and logic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Creating Vacancy Strong Interaction to Enable Homogeneous High&#8208;Throughput Ion Transport for Efficient Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&#8722; anions, while the electron&#8208;rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism.

The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high-throughput Li-ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anions, while the electron-rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra-long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high-throughput Li-ions transport mechanism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

&lt;/i&gt; materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu-based chalcogenides, the &#947;-phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost-effective and eco-friendly alternative to Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-based materials. The developed Cu&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3-&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction-acidic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single-carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu-based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh-performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

         <title>In Situ Repair and Reconstruction of Copper Surface Enhanced Its Anti&#8208;Oxidation Properties and Stability for Deep Learning&#8208;Powered Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting Labels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Density Grain Boundaries in Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox Solid&#8208;Solution Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable OER Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

&lt;p&gt;Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium-ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion-diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (K&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; composite equipped with a self-catalytic center (N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low-tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self-catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC provides a short-range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self-catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for K&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te-based anodes. Finally, the N-CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of K&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong-lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;Oligonucleotide Nanohybrids Designed for Precise Gene Therapy of Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

&lt;p&gt;The peptide-oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5-P7-R9-(G-DOPA)4-HPGGPQ-H8-C-DBCO and miRNA-124-A5-(CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)6-Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region-targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.
