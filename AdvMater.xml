An holistic analysis on the recent developments of solid&#8208;state phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for innovative thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) applications. The phase&#8208;transition fundamentals of solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) PCMs are introduced and discussed, developing strategies and molecular engineering design toward potential applications. The current challenges and future research directions on S&#8211;S PCMs in TES applications are also proposed.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8211;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8211;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention toward practical thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, the aim is to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8211;solid PCMs suitable for thermal&#8208;energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. The developing strategies of solid&#8211;solid PCMs are presented and then the structure&#8211;property relationship is discussed, followed by potential applications. Finally, an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions is presented. Hopefully, this review will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8211;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications.

         <title>Molecular sieve electrolyte membrane enables separator&#8208;free zinc batteries with ultralong cycle life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The poor stability of zinc metal anode is a main bottleneck for practical application of aqueous zinc ion batteries. Herein, a series of molecular sieves with various channel sizes are investigated as electrolyte host to regulate the ionic environment of Zn2+ on the surface of zinc anode and to realize separator&#8208;free batteries. Based on the ZSM&#8208;5 molecular sieve, a solid&#8208;liquid mixed electrolyte membrane is constructed to uniformize the zinc ions transport and foster dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Side reactions can also be suppressed through tailoring the solvation sheath and restraining the activity of water molecules in electrolyte. A V2O5||ZSM&#8208;5||Zn full cell shows significantly enhanced performance compared to cells using glass fiber separator. Specifically, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 300 mAh g&#8722;1, and a capacity retention of 98.67% after 1000 cycles and 82.67% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. It is attested that zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5, H&#8208;&#946;, and Bate) with channel sizes of 5&#8211;7 &#197; results in best cycle stability. Given the low cost and recyclability of the ZSM and its potent function, this work may further lower the cost and boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

         <title>Puffball&#8208;Inspired Microrobotic Systems with Robust Payload, Strong Protection, and Targeted Locomotion for On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Microrobots have been recognized as transformative solutions for drug delivery systems (DDSs) because they can navigate through the body to specific locations and enable targeted drug release. However, their realization is substantially limited by insufficient payload capacity, unavoidable drug leakage/deactivation, and strict modification/stability criteria for drugs. Natural puffballs possess fascinating features that are highly desirable for DDSs, including a large fruitbody for storing spores, a flexible protective cap, and environmentally&#8208;triggered release mechanisms. This report presents a puffball&#8208;inspired microrobotic system which incorporates: an internal chamber for loading large drug quantities and spatial drug separation; and a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive top&#8208;sealing layer offering strong drug protection and on&#8208;demand release. These puffball&#8208;inspired microrobots (PIMs) display tunable loading capacities up to high concentrations and enhanced drug protection with minimal drug leakage. Upon near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery with rapid release efficiency is achieved. The PIMs also demonstrate translational motion velocities, switchable motion modes, and precise locomotion under a rotating magnetic field. This work provides strong proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a DDS that combines the superior locomotion capability of microrobots with the unique characteristics of puffballs, thereby illustrating a versatile avenue for development of a new generation of microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Catalase&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Biocatalysts with Ru Catalytic Centers for ROS Elimination and Stem&#8208;Cell Protection</title>

Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#8208;N active centers of natural catalase, and here we report an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies disclose that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. We suggest that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic PtRhBiSnSb Nanoplates for Highly Efficient Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The control of multimetallic ensembles at the atomic&#8208;level is challenging, especially for the high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) possessing five or more elements. Herein, we report the one&#8208;pot synthesis of hexagonal close packed (hcp) PtRhBiSnSb high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Rh, Bi, Sn, and Sb atoms, to boost the electrochemical oxidation of liquid fuels. Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Rh towards the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves the record&#8208;high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in the alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, the robust electronic structures of active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work has offered significant research advances in developing well&#8208;defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.

This work has offered significant research advances in developing well-defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Universal Metasurfaces for Complete Linear Control of Coherent Light Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, i.e., independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here we prove that it is possible and propose a universal metasurface, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders, that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. We mathematically show the completeness of achievable light control with corresponding Jones matrices, experimentally demonstrate new types of three&#8208;dimensional holographic schemes that were formerly impossible, and present a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device. Our results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8764;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8764;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8764;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8764;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8764;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy storage performance.

         <title>Nature&#8208;inspired design of molybdenum&#8211;selenium dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, we demonstrate here a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8211;0.4 to &#8211;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through the long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. Our work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>Recent Progress in Developing a LiOH&#8208;based Reversible Nonaqueous Lithium&#8208;Air Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The realization of practical nonaqueous lithium&#8208;air batteries (LABs) calls for novel strategies to address their numerous theoretical and technical challenges. LiOH formation/decomposition has recently been proposed as a promising alternative route to cycling LABs via Li2O2. Herein, the progress in developing LiOH&#8208;based nonaqueous lithium&#8208;air batteries is reviewed. Various catalytic systems, either soluble or solid&#8208;state, that can activate a LiOH&#8208;based electrochemistry are compared in detail, with emphasis in providing an updated understanding of the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in nonaqueous media. We identify the key factors that can switch the cell chemistry between Li2O2 and LiOH and highlight the debate around these routes, as well as rationalizing potential causes for these opposing opinions. The identities of the reaction intermediates, activity of redox mediators and additives, location of reaction interfaces, causes of parasitic reactions, as well as the effect of CO2 on the LiOH electrochemistry, all play a critical role in altering the relative rates of a series of interconnected reactions and all warrant further investigation.

         <title>Role of Interfaces in Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) are considered as one of the most promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology, because they simultaneously exhibit high safety, high energy density, and wide operating temperature range. The replacement of liquid electrolytes with solid electrolytes produces numerous solid&#8208;solid interfaces within the SSBs. A thorough understanding on the roles of these interfaces is indispensable for the rational performance optimization. In this Review, we discuss the interface issues in the SSBs, including internal buried interfaces within solid electrolytes and composite electrodes, and planar interfaces between electrodes and solid electrolyte separators or current collectors. The challenges and future directions on the investigation and optimization of these solid&#8208;solid interfaces for the production of the SSBs are also assessed.

         <title>Non&#8208;Equilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photo&#8208;Excited Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but limited understanding of lattice response upon excitation exists. Here, we investigate two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction (TrXRD) as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction (PXRD) and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence (TrPL) linewidths exhibit narrowing over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight red&#8208;shifting of the optical bandgaps. We attribute these observations to transient relaxation of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8208;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photo&#8208;excitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition; however, through new single crystal XRD we find reflections that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure and reassign the static structure space group as P212121; with this we rule out non&#8208;equilibrium phase transition. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

The &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;b&lt;/i&gt; axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post-photo-excitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; would suggest a transient phase transition; however, through new single crystal XRD we find reflections that violate glide plane conditions in the reported &lt;i&gt;Pbca&lt;/i&gt; structure and reassign the static structure space group as &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; with this we rule out non-equilibrium phase transition. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Thermoformable Boron Nitride Based All&#8208;Ceramics</title>

Abstract
Thermoforming processing, traditionally reserved for thermoplastic polymers and sheet metals, has been extended here to boron&#8208;based all&#8208;ceramics. Specifically, sintered boron nitride composite sheets manufactured via a combined vibration and tape&#8208;casting photopolymerization process exhibited highly oriented microstructure which allowed these preform sheets to flow as viscous Bingham pseudoplastics during compression molding. These sintered all&#8208;ceramic preforms are thermoformed into thin, complex parts with features down to 200&#160;&#956;m. Further, a new workflow is leveraged to generate bespoke all&#8208;ceramic heat spreaders that can be press&#8208;fit onto printed circuit boards and outperform metal heat sinks as a low&#8208;profile thermal management solution. This work offers a route for other all&#8208;ceramics that may be thermoformed through first fabricating pre&#8208;forms with highly&#8208;ordered anisotropic microstructures.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;Sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;Efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sb2S3 planar solar cell with a power conversion efficiency first exceeding 8% is achieved based on the high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 absorber film fabricated using a novel multi&#8208;sulfur source collaborative chemical bath deposition technology.








Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>A Peritumorally Injected Immunomodulating Adjuvant Elicits Robust and Safe Metalloimmunotherapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet robust immunomodulating adjuvant of Zn2+&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) is developed to potentiate cancer metalloimmunotherapy without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH simultaneously modulates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and induces tumor immunogenic cell death, eliciting robust antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there are unavoidable nonspecific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off&#8208;target cells. Herein, a Zn2+ doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity, is reported. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn2+, promoting a pro&#8208;inflammatory network composed of M1&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural&#8208;killer cells. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo&#8208;/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn2+ activates the cGas&#8208;STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to induce antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn&#8208;LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. This study provides a rational bottom&#8208;up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.

&lt;p&gt;A simple yet robust immunomodulating adjuvant of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped layered double hydroxide (Zn-LDH) is developed to potentiate cancer metalloimmunotherapy without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists. Peritumorally injected Zn-LDH simultaneously modulates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and induces tumor immunogenic cell death, eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there are unavoidable nonspecific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off-target cells. Herein, a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; doped layered double hydroxide (Zn-LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity, is reported. Peritumorally injected Zn-LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, promoting a pro-inflammatory network composed of M1-tumor-associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural-killer cells. Moreover, the Zn-LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo-/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; activates the cGas-STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor-associated antigens to induce antigen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn-LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. This study provides a rational bottom-up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline Lattice&#8208;Confined Atomic Pt in Metal Carbides to Match Electronic Structures and Hydrogen Evolution Behaviors of Platinum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides with &#8220;real&#8221; matched properties as metallic platinum are developed using Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#63743;W/Mo covalent bonds. The WC lattice&#8208;confined Pt atoms exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states, similar electronic structures, and matched hydrogen evolution behaviors as Pt(111) surface; remarkably, they offer 40 times greater mass activity than Pt@C&#8208;20% in alkaline conditions.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts occupy a pivotal position in diverse catalytic applications in hydrogen chemistry and electrochemistry, for instance, the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). While adsorbed Pt atoms on supports often cause severe mismatching on electronic structures and HER behaviors from metallic Pt due to the different energy level distribution of electron orbitals. Here, the design of crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides using the Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#8208;metal covalent bonds is reported. Remarkably, the lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in the tungsten carbides (Ptdoped@WCx, both Pt and W have atomic radii of 1.3&#160;&#197;) exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states and similar electronic structures as metallic Pt, thus delivering matched energy level distributions of the Pt 5dz2 and H 1s orbitals and similar acidic hydrogen evolution behaviors. In alkaline conditions, the Ptdoped@WCx exhibits 40 times greater mass activity (49.5&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#951;&#160;=&#160;150&#160;mV) than the Pt@C because of the favorable water dissociation and H* transport. These findings offer a universal pathway to construct urgently needed atomic&#8208;scale catalysts for broad catalytic reactions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#160;&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler Using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a film&#8208;based FTEC, which shows outstanding cooling performance by using an innovative quadra&#8208;layered structure and a light vortex generator (VG). The FTEC consumes 68.5&#160;W to maintain a comfortable Tskin in the major hot spots of the walking human body, as strongly opposed to its ultrahigh counterpart (1.5&#160;kW) by traditional centralized cooling systems.








Abstract
In this study, flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) are used to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of 10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

As a result, the as-prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;functionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We experimentally demonstrate that layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, exhibits multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room&#8208;temperature centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low temperature ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, PFM, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7 also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room temperature. The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8208;electrode interface is visualized using in&#8208;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at room temperature. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at low temperatures such as 200 K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200 K. Our results shed light on the selective control of multi&#8208;functionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, e.g., different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Digital Keying Enabled by Reconfigurable Two&#8208;dimensional Modulators</title>

Abstract
Energy, area, and bandwidth efficient communication primitives are essential to sustain the rapid increase in connectivity among IoT edge devices. While IoT edge&#8208;sensing, edge&#8208;computing, and edge&#8208;storage have witnessed innovation in materials and devices, IoT edge communication is yet to experience such transformation. The aging silicon (Si) based complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to remain the mainstay of communication devices where they are used to implement amplitude, frequency, and phase shift keying (ASK/FSK/PSK). Keying allows digital information to be communicated over a radio channel. While CMOS&#8208;based keying devices have evolved over the years, their hardware footprint and energy consumption are major concerns for resource constrained IoT communication. Furthermore, separate circuit designs and hardware elements are needed for each keying scheme and achieving multi&#8208;bit modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency remains a challenge. Here, we introduce a reconfigurable modulator that exploits unique ambipolar transport and programmable Dirac voltage in ultra&#8208;thin MoTe2 field effect transistors to achieve ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation. Furthermore, by integrating two programmed MoTe2 FETs, we demonstrate multi&#8208;bit data modulation, which improves the bandwidth efficiency by 200%. Finally, a frequency quadrupler is also realized exploiting the unique &#8220;double&#8208;well&#8221; transfer characteristic. Our demonstration of multipurpose and reconfigurable MoTe2 modulators highlights the importance of material and device innovation to revolutionize future digital communication

         <title>Necklace&#8208;Like Nanostructures: From Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Recent Progress in Smart Polymeric Gel&#8208;Based Information Storage for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials to deal with the endless phenomena of information leakage and misinformation are a very important and promising field. As one of the most attractive candidates, smart gels possess excellent modifiability and unique stimulus responsiveness. Moreover, elaborate polymeric gels with chemical or physical colors can display polychrome and multistage information through the synergy of multiple functions.








Abstract
Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies. Modified intelligent polymeric gels exhibit color changes and shape morphing under external stimuli, which give them great potential for applications in information storage. This paper provides an overview of the latest progress in polymeric gel&#8208;based information storage materials in relation to counterfeiting. Following a brief introduction of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the preparation methods for intelligent gels with adjustable colors (e.g., chemical colors and physical colors) and various encryption/decryption modes involving dimensions and diverse colors are outlined. Finally, the challenges and prospects for information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting based on smart gels are discussed.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type SnSe</title>

Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

         <title>Pivotal Routes for Maximizing Semitransparent Perovskite Solar Cell Performance: Photon Propagation Management and Carrier Kinetics Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs) are ideal candidates for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPV) and tandem solar cells (TSCs) owing to their tunable bandgap and high visible transparency. The best power conversion efficiency (PCE) of ST&#8208;PSCs is close to 15% with an average visible transmittance of over 20%, which still lags far behind the PCE of normal opaque PSCs. This can be attributed to the poor light utilization efficiency (LUE) of ST&#8208;PSCs. Herein, we systematically rationalize the pivotal routes for maximizing LUE of ST&#8208;PSCs in terms of photon propagation management and carrier kinetics regulation. First, we provide the fundamental theoretical analyses on optical processes and electronic properties. Then, we provide our insights on photon propagation management measures and carrier kinetics regulation strategies. Furthermore, we provide a summary of the promising commercial application of ST&#8208;PSCs in BIPV and TSCs. Finally, we briefly summarize the main progress of ST&#8208;PSCs and propose the directions for the commercialization of ST&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization&#8208;dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el vector&#8208;dependent ISHE is still elusive, which has been long time highly pursued. Here we investigate ISHE in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generation and Mn2Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization (&#963;z) is rotated towards in&#8208;plane by the N&#233;el vectors in Mn2Au, then the spin current is converted into charge current at two staggered spin sublattices. The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. We can switch the N&#233;el vector and resultant ISHE signals, which is termed as antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect. Our finding not only adds a new member to the Hall effect family, but also makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

&lt;p&gt;Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current-driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle-like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed-shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Multilevel Hollow Phenolic Resin Nanoreactors with Precise Metal Nanoparticles Spatial Location toward Promising Heterogeneous Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale chemical surgery is reported on phenolic resins based on a dissolution and repolymerization procedure, to construct multilevel hollow structures with well&#8208;defined functional groups. Those special architectures are useful in the fabrication of novel nanomaterials, Au@APF composites, with Au nanoparticles fully embedded within the spheres, which are well suited to architect the bimetallic catalyst with remarkable hydrogenation activity.








Abstract
Hollow nanostructures with fascinating properties have inspired numerous interests in broad research fields. Cell&#8208;mimicking complex hollow architectures with precise active components distributions are particularly important, while their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; chemical surgery strategy is introduced to engrave the 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) spheres at nanoscale. Undergoing the cleavage of (Ar)C&#63743;N bonds with ethanol as chemical scissors and subsequent repolymerization process, the Solid APF transform to multilevel hollow architecture with precise nanospatial distribution of organic functional groups (e.g., hydroxymethyl and amine). The transformation is tracked by electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;techniques, the category and dosage of alcohol are pivotal for constructing&#160;multilevel hollow structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated the evolution of nanostructures accompanied with unique organic microenvironments is able to accurately confine multiple gold (Au) nanoparticles, leading to the formation of pomegranate&#8208;like particles. Through selectively depositing palladium (Pd) nanoparticles onto the outer shell, bimetallic Au@APF@Pd catalysts are formed, which exhibit excellent hydrogenation performance with turnover frequency (TOF) value up to 11257&#160;h&#8211;1. This work provides an effective method for precisely manipulating the nanostructure and composition of polymers at nanoscale and sheds light on the design of catalysts with precise spatial active components.

         <dc:description>
The enhancement&#8208;mode carbon nanotube complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) on paper substrates are first built through a printing&#8208;based process. As&#8208;fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit record low power dissipation (0.0124 pW &#181;m&#8722;1) and a superior radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1.








Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#181;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

The Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells with Co(TFSI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs-based catalysts for Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unique NiOOH@FeOOH Hetero&#8208;architecture for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of highly efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in low&#8208;grade or saline water is currently of great importance for the large&#8208;scale hydrogen production. In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, we successfully fabricated metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self&#8208;supported nickel&#8211;iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam for OER catalysis in saline water. We demonstrate that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel&#8211;iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after the electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH hetero&#8208;architecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. We propose an unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism (UDSM) to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role on the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of OER process on the multi&#8208;OH layer complex, which is expected to guide the design of hetero&#8208;architecture electrocatalysts.

         <title>Super&#8208;reversible CuF2 Cathodes Enabled by Cu2+ Coordinated Alginate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55&#160;V) and high capacity (528 mAh/g). However, CuF2 can only survive for less than 5 cycles mainly due to serious Cu&#8208;ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, we successfully suppress copper dissolution by forming Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate (Cu&#8208;SA) on the surface of CuF2 particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2 can in situ crosslink with SA binder forming a conformal Cu&#8208;SA layer on CuF2 surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu&#8208;SA layer is Li&#8208;ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu&#8208;ions in the organic 4&#160;M LiCO4/EC&#8208;PC electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2 electrode with SA binder delivered a reversible capacity of 420.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 50 cycles at 0.05 C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. Cu2+ crosslink polymer coating on CuF2 opens the door to stabilizing the high&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost CuF2 cathode for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Nonporous Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoplatform for Cuproptosis&#8208;based Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death that is copper&#8208;dependent, offers great opportunities for exploring the use of copper&#8208;based nanomaterials inducing cuproptosis for cancer treatment. Here, we develop a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered nonporous copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate ([Cu(tz)]) coordination polymer (CP) nanoplatform, denoted as GOx@[Cu(tz)], for starvation&#8208;augmented cuproptosis and photodynamic synergistic therapy. Importantly, the catalytic activity of GOx is shielded in the nonporous scaffold but can be &#8220;turned on&#8221; for efficient glucose depletion only upon glutathione (GSH) stimulation in cancer cells, thereby proceeding cancer starvation therapy. The depletion of glucose and GSH sensitizes cancer cells to the GOx@[Cu(tz)]&#8208;mediated cuproptosis, producing aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins, the target of copper&#8208;induced toxicity. The increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, due to the oxidation of glucose, activates the type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy of GOx@[Cu(tz)]. Our in vivo experiment results indicated that GOx@[Cu(tz)] produces negligible systemic toxicity and inhibits tumor growth by 92.4% in athymic mice bearing 5637 bladder tumors. To our best knowledge, this is the first report of a cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in bladder cancer, which should invigorate studies pursuing rational design of efficacious cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as band gap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands were successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands was achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. We therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear carbon supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of the Apis mellifera Honeycomb Construction by Four&#8208;Dimensional (4D) X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Honeycomb is one of nature's best engineered structures. Even though it has inspired several modern engineering structures, an understanding of the process by which the hexagonal cells are formed in 3D space is lacking. Previous studies on the structure of the honeycomb are based on either 2D microscopy or by direct visual observations. As a result, several critical features of its microstructure and the precise mechanisms of its growth are not well understood. Using 4D X&#8208;ray microscopy, this study shows, how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping&#8221;, which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind which compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.

         <title>A Biomolecular Toolbox for Precision Nanomotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The application of nanomotors for cancer diagnosis and therapy is a new and exciting area of research, which when combined with precision nanomedicine, promises to solve many of the issues encountered by previous development of passive nanoparticles. The goal of this article is to introduce nanomotor and nanomedicine researchers to the deep pool of knowledge available regarding cancer cell biology and biochemistry, as well as provide a greater appreciation of the complexity of cell membrane compositions, extracellular surfaces, and their functional consequences. We first provide a short description of the nanomotor state&#8208;of&#8208;art for cancer therapy and diagnosis, as well as recommendations for future directions of the field. Then, a biomolecular targeting toolbox has been collated for researchers looking to apply their nanomaterial of choice to a biological setting, as well as providing a glimpse into currently available clinical therapies and technologies. This toolbox contains an overview of different classes of targeting molecules available for high affinity and specific targeting and cell surface targets to aid researchers in the selection of a clinical disease model and targeting methodology. Biological systems are complex, and there is a steep learning curve for material scientists applying their skills to the fields of biochemistry and immunology. It is hoped that this review will provide biological context, inspiration, and direction to future nanomotor and nanomedicine research.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, we develop a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. The ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>A Zinc&#8208;Ion Battery&#8208;Type Self&#8208;Powered Pressure Sensor with Long Service Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nanoscale Architecture Endows Titanium Carbide MXene Electrode with Integrated High Areal and Volumetric Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Complete utilization of electrochemically active materials while maintaining the high areal/volumetric packing density is a goal to be achieved in miniaturized supercapacitor devices, which therefore display both the high volumetric and areal energy density. Although critical, it is usually challenging to achieve this goal by optimizing the electrode architecture. Densely packing of active materials maximizes the volumetric capacitance whereas results in sluggish diffusion of electrolyte. Structurization of the electrode by forming large pores creates pathway for electrolyte penetration but reduces the volumetric energy density. Here we report densified electrodes with hierarchical porous architecture at nanoscale that provides an alternative solution. Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are produced in highly viscous reaction media and assembled by mechanical compression. Expanded morphology of MXene powders translates into the buckling microstructure in electrodes, resulting in 28.2 &#177; 4.1% porosity mainly in the form of nanosized pores. At the sub&#8208;nanometer scale, the diffusion of electrolytes is enhanced in interlayer space of the bended lattice with pillared intercalants. These hierarchical structural features lead to both the high areal and volumetric capacitance (11.4 F cm&#8210;2 coupled with 770 F cm&#8210;3) in hundred&#8208;micrometres&#8208;thick electrodes, which inspires the design of high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Implanting CoOx Clusters on Ordered Macroporous ZnO Nanoreactors for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>

Abstract
Despite suffering from slow charge carrier mobility, photocatalysis is still an attractive and promising technology toward producing green fuels from solar energy. An effective approach is to design and fabricate advanced architectural materials as photocatalysts to enhance the performance of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Herein, metal&#8208;organic&#8208;framework (MOF)&#8208;derived hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen and carbon co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) structures have been developed as nanoreactors with decorated CoOx nanoclusters for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion driven by visible light. Introduction of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with highly ordered interconnected meso&#8208;macroporous channels shows beneficial properties for photocatalytic reduction reactions, including enhanced mobility of charge carriers throughout the highly accessible framework, maximized exposure of active sites and inhibited recombination of photo&#8208;induced photons. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further reveal the key role of CoOx nanoclusters with high affinity to CO2 molecules, and the Co&#8208;O bond formed on the surface of the composite exhibits stronger charge redistribution. As a result, the obtained CoOx/N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO demonstrates enhanced photocatalysis performance in terms of high CO yield and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Zirconium&#8208;Based Perovskites for Large&#8208;Area and Ultra&#8208;Flexible X&#8208;Ray Scintillator Screens</title>

Abstract
Flexible scintillator screens with environmental stability, high sensitivity and low cost have emerged as candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Here, we demonstrated a large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;efficient solution synthesis of vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6, which is characterized by thermal activation delay fluorescence (TADF) dominated by triplet emission under X&#8208;ray irradiation. The large Stokes shift and efficient luminescence collection of TADF effectively ensure the light out&#8208;coupling efficiency. Further, flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens with an area of 400 cm2 were prepared using polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) as the carrier, which exhibit excellent scintillation properties with light yields as high as 49&#8239;400 photons/MeV, spatial resolutions up to 18 lp/mm and detection limits as low as 65 nGy/s. Finally, we demonstrated the high&#8208;quality imaging results of non&#8208;planar and dynamic objects by such screens. We believe that the explored Cs2ZrCl6@PDMS flexible scintillator screens would offer a big step towards expanding the application range of scintillators in different environments.

         <title>A Polymeric Strategy Empowering Vascular Cell Selectivity and Potential Application Superior to Extracellular Matrix Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long&#8208;term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re&#8208;endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular&#8208;related biomaterials utilizing extra cellular matrix derived EC&#8208;selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR. Nevertheless, the application of EC&#8208;selective peptides is limited due to their easy proteolysis, time&#8208;consuming synthesis and expensiveness. To address these limitations, we report a polymeric strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials using amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;peptide polymers by tuning serum protein adsorption. The optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer displays EC versus SMC selectivity even superior to EC&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding the cell adhesion, proliferation and migration of EC versus SMC. Mechanism study indicates that surface adsorption of bovine serum albumin, an abundant and anti&#8208;adhesive serum protein, plays a critical role in the EC versus SMC selectivity of &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer. In addition, surface modification of the optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer effectively promotes the endothelialization of vascular implants and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. This study provides an alternative strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials, implying great potential in the vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
Non&#8208;radiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell (PSC). There has been focused research to boost the device performance by reducing number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention has been paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species were designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other hand, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defect at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

&lt;p&gt;Non-radiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cell (PSC). There has been focused research to boost the device performance by reducing number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention has been paid to the defect-capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect-capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species were designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect-capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric-screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect-capture radius.

         <title>Mass Transfer Printing of Metal&#8208;Halide Perovskite Films and Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust transfer&#8208;printing method is developed using an ultrathin chemical bonding interfacial layer. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) exhibit similar performance as optimized spin&#8208;coated LEDs, and the transfer&#8208;printed nanostructure reaches a high resolution up to 1270 ppi. A white perovskite LED structure is finally demonstrated with laterally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes made by the multiple transfer&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Most methods of depositing perovskite films cannot meet the diverse requirements of real applications such as depositing films on various types of substrates, making patterns with different bandgaps for full&#8208;color display. Here, a robust mass transfer method of perovskite films and nanostructures is reported, meeting those requirements, by using an ultrathin branched polyethylenimine as interfacial chemical bonding layers. The transfer&#8208;printed perovskite films exhibit comparable morphology, composition, optoelectronic properties, and device performances with the counterparts made by optimized spin&#8208;coating methods. The perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) using the transfer&#8208;printed films show decent external quantum efficiencies of 10.5% and 6.7% for red (680&#160;nm) and sky&#8208;blue (493&#160;nm) emissions, which are similar to the devices made by spin&#8208;coating. This robust transfer printing method also enables the the preparation of perovskite micropatterns with a high resolution up to 1270 pixels per inch. Horizontally aligned red and sky&#8208;blue perovskite microstripes are further obtained through multiple printing processes for white PeLEDs. This work demonstrates a feasible strategy for making perovskite films or micropatterns on various substrates for real applications in full&#8208;color display, white LEDs, lasing, etc.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced by the Pyro&#8208;Phototronic Effect Based on a Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance self&#8208;powered 4H&#8208;SiC ultraviolet photodetector is realized using a strong photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect, and the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect is first revealed in N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC, which is beneficial to further enhance the photodetection performance. Moreover, via delicate position designs of electrodes, the 4H&#8208;SiC chip reveals efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities.








Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light&#8208;sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect that exists in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost ten times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA mW&#8722;1, which is &#8776;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals the fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
To reach the required scale for green hydrogen, it must be produced with efficient, low&#8208;capital&#8208;expense electrolyzers using non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group catalysts. In this work, oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts in pure&#8208;water anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer devices are studied. Processes causing device failure are illustrated, nano&#8208;Co3O4 is shown to be a viable catalyst, and design rules for engineering catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability are proposed.








Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and the durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalyst for AEMWE operation, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brief methodology to synthesize sensing materials (e.g., ion&#8208;paring dyes) with hydrophobicity, ease of color tunability, and a wide visible spectrum is suggested. This can simplify the sensing array, thereby producing a color map distinguishing functional groups as well as carbon chain lengths. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes will be extended to the electronic system promising the safety and health of the user.








Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ideal dye-based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color-responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion-pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion-pairing dyes are embedded into&#160;3D&#160;stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful-gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub-ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system that automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms the effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoactivatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle is developed, which not only serves as a nanocarrier for packaging, tumor accumulation, and intracellular release of small interfering RNA against p21&#8208;activated kinase 4 to boost intratumoral&#160;immune infiltration, but also is able to initiate antitumor immunity through immunogenic phototherapy. The combined immunotherapy between boosted immune infiltration and immune activation elicits superior antitumor outcome.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photoactivatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. p21&#8208;Activated kinase 4 (PAK4) is a newly identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. Small interfering RNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photoactivatable reactive&#8208;oxygen&#8208;species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. The PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the TME through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. This work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectric Resonant Tunneling Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors under external voltage in perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 quantum&#8208;well structures are reported. The NDR ratio can be modified by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude, depending on the polarization states of the ferroelectric barrier, and a large OFF/ON resistance ratio up to 23 000 is obtained.








Abstract
Resonant tunneling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum&#8208;well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunneling diode (RTD) exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric&#8208;modulated resonant tunneling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviors in all&#8208;perovskite&#8208;oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures is reported. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tunable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8776;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy bandgap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8211;electron correlations, as follows from density functional theory calculations. This study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunneling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Excimer Formation in the Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals 2D Semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excimer formation is unambiguously demonstrated in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se via transient absorption spectroscopy. The excimer in Bi2O2Se nanosheets is diffusive and its formation can be described as excitons relax to an excimer geometry driven by the ultrafast photoscreening of the intrinsic built&#8208;in dipolar electric field.








Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type 2D material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multilayer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy is presented. It is found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales are established. Excitation&#8208;fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The instantaneous visualization of latent fingerprints (LFPs) is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water under UV light or ambient sunlight. Remarkably, LFPs can be visualized within seconds including details at the Level 3, shedding light on the potential security protection and criminal investigation in various scenarios.








Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints is developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution are readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather, and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission can be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

It can nurture the complex motion for relevant robotic interaction. The magneto&#8211;electro&#8208;ionic soft actuator obtained from the newly developed Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;derived active material is successfully utilized to demonstrate hovering motion of a hummingbird robot under magnetic and electrical stimuli.








Abstract
There is growing demand for multiresponsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields are always under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESAs) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C), are reported. Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magnetoactive and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot is demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Semicrystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in a Seawater Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface is well constructed by introducing a suitable semicrystalline structure in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers to significantly boost the nitrogen reduction reaction with a high Faradaic efficiency of 60.5% and a maximum NH3 yield rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte.








Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by low N2 solubility in the electrolyte, while a large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst can also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for the NRR. Here, it is reported that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8211;acceptor&#8208;based conjugated polymers (CPs) is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it is found that a semicrystalline CP catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency of up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations reveal the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8211;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;Independent and Cancer&#8208;Selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pro&#8208;protein approach is developed based on reversible tagging with l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1) substrate, which enables carrier&#8208;free, cancer&#8208;selective, and endocytosis&#8208;independent cytosolic delivery via LAT1&#8208;mediated direct transport. It demonstrates high generality and robust efficiency for varieties of functional proteins, including enzymes, toxins, antibodies, and CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein. This facile and versatile platform holds transformative potentials in protein pharmaceuticals.








Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell&#8208;penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, a unique carrier&#8208;free approach is reported for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins are sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;l&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of l&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein can be directly transported into tumor cells by overexpressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, overproduced H2O2 restores the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins are delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin shows potent anticancer efficacy in 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of metallic structures mimicking the specific protein assemblies in multicellular organisms, such as human cells and animal tissue, is demonstrated via antibody&#8211;antigen interactions and electroless deposition. This work enables the use of diverse protein structures that are arranged in unique 3D geometries optimized for certain functions as scaffolds for biotemplating.








Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique 3D&#160;geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissues. Using 1.4 nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissues are labeled, and then the nanogold acts as nucleation sites for growth of metal particles. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in the mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in the mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

         <title>Preparation of 2D Molybdenum Phosphide via Surface&#8208;Confined Atomic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well&#8208;defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface&#8208;confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well&#8208;documented edge&#8208;dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS2 precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination&#8208;unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.








Abstract
The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low&#8208;coordinated surface atoms. However, the synthesis of NL2DMs is complex because their crystals are held together by strong isotropic covalent bonds.

&lt;p&gt;Nonlayered molybdenum phosphide (MoP) with well-defined 2D morphology and tunable crystallinity can be prepared from layered molybdenum dichalcogenides via surface-confined atomic substitution. In contrast to the well-documented edge-dominated electrocatalytic performance of the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; precusor, the entire basal plane of MoP demonstrates satisfying electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction performance owing to its coordination-unsaturated surface atoms with abundant dangling bonds.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The emerging nonlayered 2D materials (NL2DMs) are sparking immense interest due to their fascinating physicochemical properties and enhanced performance in many applications. NL2DMs are particularly favored in catalytic applications owing to the extremely large surface area and low-coordinated surface atoms.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photovoltaic gap measured by ultraviolet and low&#8208;energy photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS/LE&#8208;IPES) gives the best correlation to device properties, enabling the prediction of maximum Voc. Cyclic voltammetry (CV)&#8208;derived redox potentials are less meaningful for predicting the energetic landscape at the &#8220;donor&#8221;&#8211;&#8220;acceptor&#8221; interface.








Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this work, the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy are determined. Solar cells are fabricated to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device VOC. It is demonstrated that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which are previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8776;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8211;A blends, it is demonstrated that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, it is shown that a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8211;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic Fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese oxide homojunctions with gradually modulated doping level host surprisingly complex, long&#8208;range ordered magnetic superstructures whose spin alignment is tunable by low magnetic fields. Homojunctions can thus serve as a powerful design element of all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices.








Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic noncollinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. The spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8722;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly noncollinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of noncollinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystalline Perovskite p&#8211;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of ultrasensitive photodetectors is demonstrated with single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays. The high crystallinity of the nanowire arrays enables efficient carrier transport and the formation of the built&#8208;in electric field in the p&#8211;n junction facilitates effective carrier separation. The photodetectors show excellent sensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with outstanding responsivities.








Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8211;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realizing sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8211;n&#8208;junction photodetectors based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices have generally been made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier&#8208;transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, a type of ultrasensitive photodetector based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays is demonstrated. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8211;n&#8208;junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405 to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm. These results will provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Exposing Single Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni single atoms embedded S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) are fabricated through pyrolysis of rationally designed CdS&#8208;NiSx@PAN composite fibers. Benefiting from the abundant exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalyst exhibits outstanding activity and stability for the oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers is reported. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N-CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Si9C15 monolayer is fabricated on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates via the reaction between Si and graphene under high temperatures. The as&#8208;grown Si9C15 layer is micrometer&#8208;scale, high quality, and single crystalline with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9 eV. Combined measurements and density functional calculations confirm the buckled honeycomb structure. The novel 2D material also shows good air stability.








Abstract
Monolayer SixCy constitutes an important family of&#160;2D&#160;materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable bandgaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with a layered structure, the fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates is reported. A combination of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D&#8208;materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi&#8208;Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
SrTiO3/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, characterized by the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, exhibits high sensitivity to human radiation. Further integration of human radiation into a noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction system is experimentally demonstrated, and the real&#8208;time recognition of hand gestures and touchless input of Arabic numbers and English letters are implemented.








Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risks from cross&#8208;infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as a stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by humans puts forward a high demand for photodetection performance. Here, a SrTiO3&#8722;x/CuNi&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile is constructed, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional&#8208;materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gestures, numbers, and letters in real&#8208;time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into noncontact human&#8211;machine interaction systems.

         <title>Percolated Plasmonic Superlattices of Nanospheres with 1 nm&#8208;Level Gap as High&#8208;Index Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Heteroligand gold nanoparticles are stable in an oil phase but can be switched to stable Janus particles at the interface, which forms a 2D superlattice over square centimeters with nanometer&#8208;precision particle&#8208;to&#8208;particle gap. The percolated 2D superstructure exhibits the highest&#8208;ever refractive index (&#8776;7.8) on varying the size and interparticle gap of the NPs, which is explained by a new theoretical model based on &#8220;plasmonic percolation.&#8221;








Abstract
Nanophotonics relies on precise control of refractive index (RI) which can be designed with metamaterials. Plasmonic superstructures of nanoparticles (NPs) can suggest a versatile way of tuning RI. However, the plasmonic effects in the superstructures demand 1 nm&#8208;level exquisite control over the interparticle gap, which is challenging in a sub&#8208;wavelength NPs. Thus far, a large&#8208;area demonstration has been mostly discouraged. Here, heteroligand AuNPs are prepared, which are stable in oil but become Janus particles at the oil&#8211;water interface, called &#8220;adaptive Janus particles.&#8221; NPs are bound at the interface and assembled into 2D arrays over square centimeters as toluene evaporates, which distinctively exhibits the RI tunability. In visible and NIR light, the 2D superstructures exhibit the highest&#8208;ever RI (&#8776;7.8) with varying the size and interparticle gap of NPs, which is successfully explained by a plasmonic percolation model. Furthermore, fully solution&#8208;processable 2D plasmonic superstructures are proved to be advantageous in flexible photonic devices such as distributed Bragg reflectors.

         <title>Robust Piezoelectricity with Spontaneous Polarization in Monolayer Tellurene and Multilayer Tellurium Film at Room Temperature for Reliable Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization is detected in tellurene at room temperature due to the strong anisotropic property and dipoles induced by unique charity helical chain structure and strong intramolecular interactions. A charming memory window and high on switching current are realized in tellurene&#8208;based memory, providing a new platform to construct robust memory cells for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Robust neuromorphic computing in the Big Data era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cells; however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell a failure. Searching for a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable nonvolatile cross&#8208;array memory cells. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switching, but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein, apparent piezoelectricity is experimentally confirmed with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary 2D Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. A large memory window of 7000, a low working voltage of 2&#160;V, and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#181;A&#8201;&#181;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te&#8208;based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switching and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a platform to build robust, reliable, and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Rapid Ultratough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving tough adhesion in wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. It is shown that combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix can achieve ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000 J m&#8722;2) without covalent bond formation. These properties open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives.








Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#63743;COOH and &#63743;NH2&#160;groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, it is shown that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultratough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) in 5&#8211;10&#160;min without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion is shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bioapplications.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultrarapid Protein Detection via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) at the sample incubation step accelerates the operation of an organic&#8208;electrochemical&#8208;transistor&#8208;based protein sensor with a limit of detection at the attomolar range. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits a sample&#8208;to&#8208;result time of 2 min, with better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation.








Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) is integrated in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8211;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 spike protein in human saliva as an example target, it is shown that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 min of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion&#8208;dominated operation. The performance of ACET integrated sensors is compared with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations are investigated. The results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT&#8208;based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing and Light&#8208;Soaking in MAPbI3: The Effect of H2O</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two&#8208;photon&#8208;induced photodamage and consequent self&#8208;healing inside MAPbI3 single crystals are investigated. Two photobrightening and one photodarkening process are identified,&#160;which&#160;are connected to trap&#8208;filling, methylamine&#8208;chemistry, and the lead&#8208;halide sublattice. H2O is&#160;found&#160;to&#160;strongly influence the overall photodamage and kinetics of the self&#8208;healing process, showing an important connection between self&#8208;healing and the presence of H2O. 








Abstract
The future of halide perovskites (HaPs) is beclouded by limited understanding of their long&#8208;term stability. While HaPs can be altered by radiation that induces multiple processes, they can also return to their original state by &#8220;self&#8208;healing.&#8221; Here two&#8208;photon (2P) absorption is used to effect light&#8208;induced modifications within MAPbI3 single crystals. Then the changes in the photodamaged region are followed by measuring the photoluminescence, from 2P absorption with 2.5&#160;orders of magnitude lower intensity than that used for photodamaging the MAPbI3. After photodamage, two brightening and one darkening process are found, all of which recover but on different timescales. The first two are attributed to trap&#8208;filling (the fastest) and to proton&#8208;amine&#8208;related chemistry (the slowest), while photodamage is attributed to the lead&#8208;iodide sublattice. Surprisingly, while after 2P&#8208;irradiation of crystals that are stored in dry, inert ambient, photobrightening (or &#8220;light&#8208;soaking&#8221;) occurs, mostly photodarkening is seen after photodamage in humid ambient, showing an important connection between the self&#8208;healing of a HaP and the presence of H2O, for long&#8208;term steady&#8208;state illumination, practically no difference remains between samples kept in dry or humid environments. This result suggests that photobrightening requires a chemical&#8208;reservoir that is sensitive to the presence of H2O, or possibly other proton&#8208;related, particularly amine, chemistry.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
While neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations, the accuracy needs improvement by reducing the randomness of memristive behavior. The controlled formation of conduction channels is shown here, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. The results suggest an effective route for controlling the otherwise random electroforming process.








Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, the controlled formation of conduction channels is achieved with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. This work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;Exclusion and Site&#8208;Specific Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.








Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge.

The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8722;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 d) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.

&lt;p&gt;An in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process affords nanocomposite materials comprising sub-1&#160;nm Ag nanoparticles (AgNPs) encapsulated in hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected metal&#8211;organic framework materials, the AgNPs@HOFs exhibit significantly enhanced photocurrent. A portable photoelectrochemical (PEC) device based on AgNPs@HOF-101 detects chemical warfare agent (CWA) simulants with both nanomolar sensitivity and excellent selectivity.

         <title>A New Polymer Donor Enables Binary All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 18% Efficiency and Excellent Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rational molecular design, a polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed. Optimal power conversion efficiencies of 18.0% and 16.5% are achieved in rigid and flexible all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic cells, respectively. This work demonstrates that PQM&#8208;Cl is a promising polymer donor and the design of new polymer donors is essential for further improving the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.








Abstract
The development of polymerized small&#8208;molecule acceptors has boosted the power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of all&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells to 17%. However, the polymer donors suitable for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells are still lacking, restricting the further improvement of their PCEs. Herein, a new polymer donor named PQM&#8208;Cl is designed and its photovoltaic performance is explored. The negative electrostatic potential and low average local ionization energy distribution of the PQM&#8208;Cl surface enable efficient charge generation and transfer process. When blending with a well&#8208;used polymer acceptor, PY&#8208;IT, the PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based devices deliver an impressive PCE of 18.0% with a superior fill factor of 80.7%, both of which are the highest values for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells. The relevant measurements demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based films possess excellent mechanical and flexible properties. As such, PQM&#8208;Cl&#8208;based flexible photovoltaic cells are fabricated and an excellent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability is displayed. These results demonstrate that PQM&#8208;Cl is a potential candidate for all&#8208;polymer OPV cells and provide insights into the design of polymer donors for high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

Organic Semiconductors
In article number 2202575, Anirudh Sharma, Derya Baran, and co&#8208;workers unravel the inconsistencies of the determination of the absolute energy levels in organic semiconductors and their implication, particularly in the field of organic solar cells. In the cover image, the charges generated by the excitation of the materials by light are represented by the energy balls with feet and hands: electrons are represented in green and holes in red. The charges are jumping down a staircase, representing the energy levels of different organic semiconductor materials.

Bismuth Oxyselenide
Novel photoinduced quasiparticles, excimers, in the non&#8208;van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se are unambiguously by Jianbo Hu and co&#8208;workers in article number 2204227, identified through analyzing the emerging dynamic features by transient absorption spectra. Excimers in the Bi2O2Se nanosheets are diffusive and their formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work advances the fundamental understanding of carrier dynamics in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are cpomprehensively reviewed regarding the key design parameters, the current performances, and recent advances on failure analysis and promotion strategies on cathode, electrolyte, and anode.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries promise great potential as high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage devices due to their ultrahigh theoretical energy density of 2600&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Evaluation and analysis on practical Li&#8211;S pouch cells are essential for achieving actual high energy density under working conditions and affording developing directions for practical applications. This review aims to afford a comprehensive overview of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S pouch cells regarding 7&#160;years of development and to point out further research directions. Key design parameters to achieve actual high energy density are addressed first, to define the research boundaries distinguished from coin&#8208;cell&#8208;level evaluation. Systematic analysis of the published literature and cutting&#8208;edge performances is then conducted to demonstrate the achieved progress and the gap toward practical applications. Following that, failure analysis as well as promotion strategies at the pouch cell level are, respectively, discussed to reveal the unique working and failure mechanism that shall be accordingly addressed. Finally, perspectives toward high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S pouch cells are presented regarding the challenges and opportunities of this field.

         <title>Reactive Oxygen Species Scavenging Nanomedicine for the Treatment of Ischemic Heart Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The current developments, achievements, challenges, and future directions of reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomedicine for the treatment of ischemic heart disease (IHD), as well as their risk factors, are reviewed. The properties, generation, and physiological roles of ROS in the process of IHD development and progression are discussed.








Abstract
Ischemic heart disease (IHD) is the leading cause of disability and mortality worldwide. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been shown to play key roles in the progression of diabetes, hypertension, and hypercholesterolemia, which are independent risk factors that lead to atherosclerosis and the development of IHD. Engineered biomaterial&#8208;based nanomedicines are under extensive investigation and exploration, serving as smart and multifunctional nanocarriers for synergistic therapeutic effect. Capitalizing on cell/molecule&#8208;targeting drug delivery, nanomedicines present enhanced specificity and safety with favorable pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics. Herein, the roles of ROS in both IHD and its risk factors are discussed, highlighting cardiovascular medications that have antioxidant properties, and summarizing the advantages, properties, and recent achievements of nanomedicines that have ROS scavenging capacity for the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, ischemia/reperfusion, and myocardial infarction. Finally, the current challenges of nanomedicines for ROS&#8208;scavenging treatment of IHD and possible future directions are discussed from a clinical perspective.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Phase Exfoliation of Nonlayered Non&#8208;Van&#8208;Der&#8208;Waals Crystals into Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 35, September 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent research progress on the use of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation beyond layered van der Waals (vdW) crystals is summarized. Questions remain unanswered on how these 3D strongly bonded nonlayered crystals exfoliate into nanoplatelets, and on the insight of the exfoliation mechanism. The answer to the questions helps in revealing the future direction of this newly grown sub&#8208;family of 2D&#8208;class of materials.








Abstract
For nearly 15 years, researchers have been using liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) to produce 2D nanosheets from layered crystals. This has yielded multiple 2D materials in a solution&#8208;processable form whose utility has been demonstrated in multiple applications. It was&#160;believed that the exfoliation of such materials is enabled by the very large bonding anisotropy of layered materials where the strength of intralayer chemical bonds is very much larger than that of interlayer van der Waals bonds. However, over the last five years, a number of papers have raised questions about our&#160;understanding of exfoliation by describing the LPE of nonlayered materials. These results are extremely surprising because, as no van der Waals gap is present to provide an easily cleaved direction, the exfoliation of such compounds requires the breaking of only chemical bonds. Here the progress in this unexpected new research area is examined. The structure and properties of nanoplatelets produced by LPE of nonlayered materials are reviewed. A number of unexplained trends are found, not least the preponderance of isotropic materials that have been exfoliated to give high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio nanoplatelets. Finally, the applications potential of this new class of 2D materials are considered.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure towards High Rejection Ratio Solar&#8208;blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the TMDs and group IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in our experiment. Furthermore, in order to extend the photoresponse spectrum to solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV), doping engineering is adopted to form an additional electron state, which provides an extra carrier transition channel. In this work, pure MoS2/SnSe2 and doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructures are both fabricated. In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. Our results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. As a result, the IPBSCs achieve a lab power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% along with certificated value at 23.4%, currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSC.

The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Spleen&#8208;Targeted Glabridin&#8208;Loaded Nanoparticles Regulate Polarization of Monocyte/Macrophage (Mo/M&#966;) for the Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>

         <dc:description>
Glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (NPGla&#8208;5k) can selectively deliver Gla to the spleen and regulate the polarization of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;). By inhibiting Mo/M&#966; mediated inflammatory damage and enhancing its repairing effect, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment improves nervous system function in mice with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.








Abstract
During cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion (I&#8208;R) injury, the infiltration of monocyte/macrophages (Mo/M&#966;) into the ischemic penumbra causes inflammatory damage but also regulates tissue repair in the penumbra. The regulation and balance of Mo/M&#966; polarization is considered as a potential therapeutic target for treating cerebral I&#8208;R injury. Herein, these findings demonstrate that glabridin (Gla)&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (i.e., NPGla&#8208;5k) can effectively inhibit M1&#8208;polarization and enhance M2&#8208;polarization of Mo/M&#966;. Positron emission tomography (PET) imaging shows that NPGla&#8208;5k can selectively accumulate in the spleen following intravenous injection. Spleen&#8208;targeted Cy5&#8208;NPGla&#8208;5k can co&#8208;localize with peripheral macrophages in the penumbra at 24&#160;h after tail&#8208;vein injection. Interestingly, NPGla&#8208;5k treatment can reduce inflammatory damage, protect dying neurons, and improve nervous system function. The protective effect of spleen&#8208;targeted NPGla&#8208;5k against cerebral I&#8208;R injury in mice encourages an exploration of their use for clinical treatment of patients with cerebral I&#8208;R injury.

         <title>Molecularly Distorted Local Structure in Bi2CuO4 Oxide to Stabilize Lattice Oxygen for Efficient Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2CuO4 oxide precatalyst delivers high&#8208;efficiency CO2&#8208;to&#8208;HCOOH conversion electrocatalysis. Benefiting from the molecularly distorted local structure with [CuO4]6&#8722; square&#8208;planar units rotation, more lattice oxygen can be retained during theelectrochemical CO2 reduction process. The retained local lattice oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate, thereby promoting the CO2 reduction efficiency.








Abstract
The electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) provides an economically feasible way for converting green energy into valuable chemical feedstocks and fuels. Great progress has been achieved in the understanding and synthesis of oxidized&#8208;based precatalysts; however, their dynamical changes of local structure under operando conditions still hinder their further applications. Here a molecularly distorted Bi2CuO4 precatalyst for efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion is reported. X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) results and theoretical calculations suggest that the distorted structure with molecularly like [CuO4]6&#8722; unit rotation is more conducive to the structural stability of the sample. Operando XAFS and scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) results prove that quite a bit of lattice oxygen can remain in the distorted sample after CO2RR. Electrochemical measurements of the distorted sample show an excellent activity and selectivity with a high formate partial current density of 194.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at an extremely low overpotential of &#8722;400&#160;mV. Further in situ surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (SEIRAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations illustrate that the retained oxygen can optimize the adsorption of *OCHO intermediate for the enhanced CO2RR performance.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Lattice Mismatch Driven Small Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially&#8208;Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly&#8208;correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, we demonstrate that, contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map was proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework was experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially&#8208;grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and could provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>A review on regulating Li+ solvation structures in carbonate electrolytes for lithium metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered promising candidates for next&#8208;generation battery systems due to their high energy density. However, commercialized carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anodes. While increasing cut&#8208;off voltage is an effective way to boost the energy density of LMBs, conventional ethylene carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes undergo a number of side reactions at high voltages. It is therefore critical to upgrade conventional carbonate electrolytes, the performance of which is highly influenced by the solvation structure of lithium ions (Li+). This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li+ in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li+ solvation structure and Li+ behavior. We systematically compare different strategies to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. Remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.

This review provides a comprehensive overview of the strategies to regulate the solvation structure of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in carbonate electrolytes for LMBs by better understanding the science behind the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; solvation structure and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; behavior. We systematically compare different strategies to help select better electrolytes for specific applications. Remaining scientific and technical problems are pointed out, and directions for future research on carbonate electrolytes for LMBs are proposed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of two&#8208;dimensional materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, the magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (nano&#8208;ARPES) and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), we systematically measure the yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality. Our measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Terahertz Topological Response in Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal NbIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electromagnetic spectrum between microwave and infrared light is termed the &#8220;terahertz (THz) gap&#8221;, of which there is an urgent lack of feasible and efficient room&#8208;temperature (RT) THz detectors. Type&#8208;II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been predicted to host significant RT topological&#160;photoresponses in low&#8208;frequency regions, especially in the THz gap, well addressing the shortcomings of THz detectors. However, such devices have&#160;not&#160;been&#160;experimentally realized so far. Herein, we demonstrate a type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based THz detector, i.e., a NbIrTe4&#8208;based device, which exhibits a photoresponsivity of 5.7&#215;104 V/W, a detectivity of 2.9&#215;109 Jones, and a 1&#8208;year air stability at RT, comparable&#160;to the best RT THz detectors. Such excellent THz&#8208;detection performance can be attributed to the topological effect of the type&#8208;II WSM in which the effective mass of photogenerated electrons can be reduced by the large tilting angle of the Weyl cones to further improve mobility and photoresponsivity. Impressively, this device shows a giant intrinsic anisotropic conductance ( &#963;max/&#963;min= 339) and THz response ( Iph&#8197;max/Iph&#8197;min = &#8197;40.9), both of which, to the best of our knowledge, are record values. Our findings open a new avenue for the realization of uncooled and high&#8208;sensitive THz detectors by exploring type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Shaping A Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: (1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. (2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. This review summarizes the key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices.

         <title>Many&#8208;body molecular interactions in a memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electronic transitions in molecular circuit elements hinge on complex interactions between molecules and ions, offering a multi&#8208;dimensional parameter space to embed, access, and optimize material functionalities for target&#8208;specific applications. This opportunity has not been cultivated in molecular memristors because their low&#8208;temperature charge transport, which is a route to decipher molecular many&#8208;body interactions, is unexplored. To address this, we designed robust, temperature&#8208;resilient molecular memristors based on a Ru complex of an azo aromatic ligand and performed current&#8208;voltage sweep measurements from room temperature down to 2 Kelvin with different cooling protocols. By freezing out or activating different components of supramolecular dynamics, we could control the local Coulombic interactions between the molecules and counterions that affected the electronic transport. We designed operating conditions where functionalities spanning bipolar, unipolar, non&#8208;volatile, and volatile memristors with sharp as well as gradual analog transitions were captured within a single device. A mathematical design space evolved thereof comprising 36 tuneable parameters in which all possible steady&#8208;state functional variations in a memristor characteristic could be attainable. This enables a deterministic design route to engineer neuromorphic devices with unprecedented control over the transformation characteristics governing their functional flexibility and tunability.

         <title>Black Phosphorous Mediates Surface Charge Redistribution of CoSe2 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction offers a green method to mitigate current dependence on the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, promising its on&#8208;site applications. Unfortunately, in alkaline environments, H2O2 is not stable and undergoes rapid decomposition. Making H2O2 in acidic electrolytes can prevent its decomposition, but choices of active, stable and selective electrocatalysts are significantly limited. Here we report the selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen towards H2O2 in acid by a composite catalyst that composed of black phosphorus (BP) nailed chemically on the metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) surface. We find that this catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 product at an overpotential of 300 millivolts. Moreover, it can mediate O2 to H2O2 with a high production rate of ca. 1530&#160;mg L&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 cm&#8211;2 in a flow cell reactor. Spectroscopic and computational studies together uncover a BP&#8208;induced surface charge redistribution in CoSe2, which leads to a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the HOO* adsorption, thus enhancing the kinetics towards H2O2 formation.

         <title>Establishing self&#8208;dopant design principles from structure&#8208;function relationships in self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimide organic semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Self&#8208;doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. We investigated a structurally diverse series of self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimides (PDIs) to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge carrier mobility. Our studies show that self&#8208;n&#8208;doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, leading us to conclude that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In&#8208;situ grazing incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long&#8208;range ordering. These features are then correlated to contactless carrier mobility measurements with time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity before and after thermal annealing. The collective relationships between structural features and functionality are finally used to establish explicit self&#8208;n&#8208;dopant design principles for the future design of materials with improved functionality.

         <title>Metal Confined in Two&#8208;dimensional Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while remain great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, we report a metal confined two&#8208;dimensional (2D) sub&#8208;nanometer channel to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected TEM observes that the metals with size of &#8764;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in GO interlayer channels with averaged height of &#8764;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating size&#8208;sieving effect with molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8764;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Etching Bulk COFs into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. We developed a covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy used molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch bulk COF into nanoparticles and had universal applicability to imine bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure could prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endowed the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy (CDT) performance and glutathione (GSH) consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieved a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, we&#160;combine the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes, with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultra thin piezoelectric resonators. we&#160;demonstrate that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the dc bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, we&#160;switch the BTO membrane between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, the ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here we report a new strategy to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#956;e) increases from &#8764;3.6 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 to near 15.6 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25&#160;&#956;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and Technology Computer&#8208;Aided Design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#956;e of &gt;50.2 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicron resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices

Abstract
Glass electronics inspire the emergence of smart functional surfaces. To evolve this concept to the next level, developing new strategies for scalable, inexpensive, and electrically conductive glass&#8208;based robust nanocomposites is crucial. Graphene is an attractive material as a conductive filler; however, integrating it firmly into glass without the need for energy&#8208;intensive sintering, melting, or harsh chemicals has not been possible until now. Moreover, these methods have very limited capability for fabricating robust patterns for electronic circuits. In this work, for the first time, we achieve a conductive (160&#160;Ohm sq&#8211;1) and resilient nanocomposite between glass and graphene via single&#8208;step laser&#8208;induced backward transfer (LIBT). Beyond conventional LIBT involving photonic&#8208;induced mass transfer, our approach simultaneously drives chemical transformations in glass, including silicon compound formation and graphene oxide (GO) reduction. These processes take place together with the generation and transfer of the highest&#8208;quality laser&#8208;reduced GO reported to date (Raman intensity ratio ID/IG = 0.31) and its integration into glass. Our rGO&#8208;LIBT nanocomposite was further functionalized with silver to achieve a highly sensitive (10&#8211;9&#160;M) dual&#8208;channel plasmonic optical and electrochemical sensor. Besides the electrical circuit demonstration, we show an electrothermal heater that can maintain temperatures above 300&#160;&#176;C and continuously operate for over 48&#160;h.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>

         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Hydrogel&#8208;Based Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electronics is an emerging field of research involving multiple disciplines, which include but not limited to physics, chemistry, materials science, electronic engineering, and biology. However, the broad applications of flexible electronics are still restricted due to several limitations, including high Young's modulus, poor biocompatibility, and poor responsiveness. Innovative materials aiming for overcoming these drawbacks and boost its practical application is highly desirable. Hydrogel is a class of 3D crosslinked hydrated polymer networks, and its exceptional material properties render it a promising candidate for the next generation of flexible electronics. Here, we review the latest methods of synthesizing advanced functional hydrogels and the state&#8208;of&#8208;art applications of hydrogel&#8208;based flexible electronics in various fields. More importantly, we discuss on the correlation between properties of the hydrogel and device performance, to have better understanding of the development of flexible electronics by using environmentally responsive hydrogels. Lastly, we provide perspectives on the current challenges and future directions in the development of hydrogel&#8208;based multifunctional flexible electronics.

         <title>Overcoming the Limitations of MXene Electrodes for Solution&#8208;Processed Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MXenes constitute a rapidly growing family of two&#8208;dimensional materials that are promising for optoelectronic applications because of numerous attractive properties, including high electrical conductivity. However, the most widely used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene transparent conductive electrode has insufficient environmental stability and work function (WF), which impede practical applications Ti3C2Tx electrodes in solution&#8208;processed optoelectronics. Herein, we present Ti3C2Tx MXene film with a compact structure and a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) barrier layer as a promising electrode for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrode has excellent environmental stability, high WF of 5.84&#160;eV and low sheet resistance RS of 97.4 &#937;/sq. The compact Ti3C2Tx structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the WF. Thus, the WF and RS changed negligibly even after 22 days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti3C2Tx MXene was applied for large&#8208;area, ten&#8208;by&#8208;ten passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6 &#215; 6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low WF of MXene electrodes for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronics.

&lt;/i&gt; structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the &lt;i&gt;WF&lt;/i&gt;. Thus, the &lt;i&gt;WF&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt; changed negligibly even after 22 days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;T&lt;i&gt;

&lt;/i&gt; MXene was applied for large-area, ten-by-ten passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6 &#215; 6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low &lt;i&gt;WF&lt;/i&gt; of MXene electrodes for solution-processable optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Exceptionally High Saturation Magnetic Flux Density and Ultra&#8208;low Coercivity Via an Amorphous&#8208;nanocrystalline Transitional Microstructure in a FeCo&#8208;based Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High saturation magnetic flux density (Bs) of soft magnetic materials is essential for increasing the power density of modern magnetic devices and motor machines. Yet, increasing Bs is always at the expense of high coercivity (Hc), presenting a general trade&#8208;off in soft magnetic material family. Here, the superior comprehensive soft magnetic properties, i.e., an exceptionally high Bs of up to 1.94 T and an Hc as low as 4.3 A m&#8211;1 are unprecedented combined in a FeCo&#8208;based alloy. This alloy is obtained through a composition design strategy to construct a transitional microstructure between amorphous and traditional nanocrystalline alloys, with nanocrystals (with &lt; 5&#8208;nm&#8208;sized crystal&#8208;like regions around) sparsely dispersed in amorphous matrix. Such transitional microstructure possesses extremely low magnetic anisotropy caused by the annihilation of quasi&#8208;dislocation dipole, and a strong magnetic exchange interaction, which leads to excellent comprehensive magnetic properties. The results provide useful guidelines for the development of next generation of soft magnetic materials, which are promising for applications of high frequency, high efficiency and energy saving devices.

Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we developed a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256 &#215; 256 pixels, and low distortion. We believe that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>A Meta&#8208;Device for Intelligent Depth Perception</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the magic stairs, an innovative and complementary integration of light&#8208;field and structured&#8208;light depth mapping and imaging system using a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 meta&#8208;lens array to measure the depth over a 30 cm range is shown. This compact, lightweight, low power consumption system can be used for autonomous systems in all light levels conditions.








Abstract
The optical illusion affects depth&#8208;sensing due to the limited and specific light&#8208;field information acquired by single&#8208;lens imaging. The incomplete depth information or visual deception would cause cognitive errors. To resolve this problem, an intelligent and compact depth&#8208;sensing meta&#8208;device that is miniaturized, integrated, and applicable for diverse scenes in all light levels is demonstrated. The compact and multifunction stereo vision system adopts an array with 3600 achromatic meta&#8208;lenses and a size of 1.2 &#215; 1.2 mm2 to measure the depth over a 30&#160;cm range with deep&#8208;learning support. The meta&#8208;lens array can act as multiple imaging lenses to collect light field information. It can also work with a light source as an active optical device to project a structured light. The meta&#8208;lens array can serve as the core functional component of a light&#8208;field imaging system under bright conditions or a structured&#8208;light projection system in the dark. The depth information in both ways can be analyzed and extracted by the convolutional neural network. This work provides a new avenue for the applications such as autonomous driving, machine vision, human&#8211;computer interaction, augmented reality, biometric identification, etc.

         <title>Diffusive Memristors with Uniform and Tunable Relaxation Time for Spike Generation in Event&#8208;Based Pattern Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A diffusive memristor is a promising building block for brain&#8208;inspired computing hardware. However, the randomness in the device dynamics limits the wide&#8208;range adoption of diffusive memristors in large arrays. In this work, we engineered the device stack to achieve a much&#8208;improved uniformity in the relaxation time (standard deviation &#963;&#8197;reduced from &#8764;12 to &#8764;0.32&#160;ms). We further connected the memristor with a resistor or a capacitor and tuned the relaxation time between 1.13 &#956;s to 1.25&#160;ms, ranging from three orders of magnitude. We implemented the hierarchy of time surfaces (HOTS) algorithm to utilize the tunable and uniform relaxation behavior for spike generation. We achieved 77.3% accuracy in recognizing moving objects in the neuromorphic MNIST (N&#8208;MNIST) dataset. Our work paves the way for building emerging neuromorphic computing hardware systems with ultralow power consumption.

         <title>Harnessing the Metal&#8212;Insulator Transition of VO2 in Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Future&#8208;generation neuromorphic computing seeks to overcome the limitations of von Neumann architectures by co&#8208;locating logic and memory functions, thereby emulating the function of neurons and synapses in the human brain. Despite remarkable demonstrations of high&#8208;fidelity neuronal emulation, the predictive design of neuromorphic circuits starting from knowledge of material transformations remains challenging. VO2 is an attractive candidate since it manifests a near&#8208;room&#8208;temperature, discontinuous, and hysteretic metal&#8212;insulator transition. The transition provides a nonlinear dynamical response to input signals, as needed to construct neuronal circuit elements. We discuss strategies for tuning the transformation characteristics of VO2 based on modification of material properties, interfacial structure, and field couplings. Dynamical modulation of transformation characteristics through in&#8208;situ material processing is discussed as a means of imbuing synaptic function. We emphasize mechanistic understanding of site&#8208;selective modification; external, epitaxial, and chemical strain; defect dynamics; and interfacial field coupling in modifying local atomistic structure, the implications therein for electronic structure, and ultimately, the tuning of transformation characteristics. We highlight opportunities for inverse design and for using design principles related to thermodynamics and kinetics of electronic transitions learned from VO2 to inform the design of new Mott materials, as well as to go beyond energy&#8208;efficient computation to manifest intelligence.

         <title>Smart Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium: from Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Eutectic Gallium&#8208;Indium (EGaIn), a liquid metal with a melting point close to or below room temperature, has attracted extensive attention in recent years due to its excellent properties such as fluidity, high conductivity, thermal conductivity, stretchability, self&#8208;healing capability, biocompatibility, and recyclability. These features of EGaIn can be adjusted by changing the experimental condition, and various composite materials with extended properties can be further obtained by mixing EGaIn with other materials. In this review, not only the unique properties of EGaIn are introduced, but also the working principles for the EGaIn&#8208;based devices are illustrated and the developments of EGaIn&#8208;related techniques are summarized. The applications of EGaIn in various fields, such as flexible electronics (sensors, antennas, electronic circuits), molecular electronics (molecular memory, opto&#8208;electronic switches or reconfigurable junctions), energy catalysis (heat management, motors, generators, batteries), biomedical science (drug delivery, tumor therapy, bioimaging and neural interfaces) are reviewed. Finally, a critical discussion of the main challenges for the development of EGaIn&#8208;based techniques are discussed, and the potential applications in new fields are prospected.

         <title>Heterogeneous Interface Enhanced Adsorption of Organic and Hydroxyl for Biomass Electrooxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an efficient way to obtain high value&#8208;added biomass&#8208;derived chemicals.&#160;Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction (OER) performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation.&#160;However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH&#8211; species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO&#8208;PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset&#8208;potential of HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open circuit potential (OCP), in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculation indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule.&#160;Meanwhile, CuO&#8208;PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH&#8211; species, as demonstrated by Zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interface and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multi&#8208;component electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Powder metallurgy route to ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals are promising materials for applications in aerospace, microelectronics, nuclear and many others under extreme environment. Powder metallurgy (PM) allows to produce such materials with well controlled chemistry and microstructure at multiple length scales and near&#8208;net shape manufacturing. However, sintering refractory metals to full density while maintaining a fine microstructure is still challenging due to the high sintering temperature and the difficulty to separate the kinetics of densification versus grain growth. Here we seek to provide an overview of the sintering issues, microstructural design rules and PM practices towards ultrafine&#8208;grained and nanocrystalline refractory metals. We shall review the previous efforts to address the processing challenges, including the use of fine/nano powders, second&#8208;phase grain growth inhibitors, and field&#8208;assisted sintering techniques. Recently, pressureless two&#8208;step sintering has been successfully demonstrated in producing dense ultrafine&#8208;grained refractory metals down to &#8764;300&#160;nm average grain size with a uniform microstructure and this technological breakthrough shall be reviewed. PM progresses in specific materials systems shall be next reviewed, including elementary metals (W and Mo), refractory alloys (W&#8208;Re), refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys and their composites. Lastly, future developments and the endeavor towards ultrafine&#8208;grained and nanocrystalline refractory metals with exceptional fine microstructure and improved properties are outlined.

         <title>Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q = S, Se, Te) Silver Chalcogenide Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermoelectric technology provides a promising solution to sustainable energy utilization and scalable power supply. Recently, Ag2Q&#8208;based (Q = S, Se, Te) silver chalcogenides have come forth as potential thermoelectric materials that are endowed with complex crystal structures, high carrier mobility coupled with low lattice thermal conductivity, and even exceptional plasticity. This review presents the latest advances in this material family, from binary compounds to ternary and quaternary alloys, covering the understanding of multi&#8208;scale structures and peculiar properties, the optimization of thermoelectric performance, and the rational design of new materials. The &#8220;composition&#8208;phase structure&#8208;thermoelectric/mechanical properties&#8221; correlation is emphasized. Flexible and hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric prototypes based on Ag2Q materials are also demonstrated. Several key problems and challenges are put forward concerning further understanding and optimization of Ag2Q&#8208;based thermoelectric chalcogenides.

         <title>Thermal Transport Properties of Phonons in Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for various applications, such as photovoltaic, optoelectronic, and thermoelectric applications. The knowledge of the thermal transport of halide perovskites is essential for enhancing the device performance for these applications and improving the understanding of heat transport in complicated material systems with atomic disorders. In this work, we review the current understanding of the experimentally and theoretically obtained thermal transport properties of halide perovskites. We comprehensively examine the reported thermal conductivity of methylammonium lead iodide, which is a prototype material, and provide theoretical frameworks for its lattice vibrational properties. The frameworks and discussions are extended to other halide perovskites and derivative structures. The implications for device applications, such as solar cells and thermoelectrics, are discussed.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; is an ideal topological material for room-temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

         <title>Recent Progress in 1D Contacts for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals gap&#8208;free 1D contacts to 2D materials, toward their large&#8208;scale application to 2D electronic and quantum devices, are reviewed. 1D edge contacts enable low contact resistivity, scattering&#8208;free carrier transport, high&#8208;density transistor integration, and double&#8208;gate transistor operation. In addition, an outlook of the 1D contact methods is presented.








Abstract
Recent studies have intensively examined 2D materials (2DMs) as promising materials for use in future quantum devices due to their atomic thinness. However, a major limitation occurs when 2DMs are in contact with metals: a van der Waals (vdW) gap is generated at the 2DM&#8208;metal interfaces, which induces metal&#8208;induced gap states that are responsible for an uncontrollable Schottky barrier (SB), Fermi&#8208;level pinning (FLP), and high contact resistance (RC), thereby substantially lowering the electronic mobility of 2DM&#8208;based devices. Here, vdW&#8208;gap&#8208;free 1D edge contact is reviewed for use in 2D devices with substantially suppressed carrier scattering of 2DMs with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) encapsulation. The 1D contact further enables uniform carrier transport across multilayered 2DM channels, high&#8208;density transistor integration independent of scaling, and the fabrication of double&#8208;gate transistors suitable for demonstrating unique quantum phenomena of 2DMs. The existing 1D contact methods are reviewed first. As a promising technology toward the large&#8208;scale production of 2D devices, seamless lateral contacts are reviewed in detail. The electronic, optoelectronic, and quantum devices developed via 1D contacts are subsequently discussed. Finally, the challenges regarding the reliability of 1D contacts are addressed, followed by an outlook of 1D contact methods.

         <title>Flat&#8211;Zigzag Interface Design of Chalcogenide Heterostructure toward Ultralow Volume Expansion for High&#8208;Performance Potassium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable interface design strategy is presented that two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio versus MoS2 and Bi2S3, which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity.








Abstract
Heterostructure construction of layered metal chalcogenides can boost their alkali&#8208;metal storage performance, where the charge transfer kinetics can be promoted by the built&#8208;in electric fields. However, these heterostructures usually undergo interface separation due to severe layer expansion, especially for large&#8208;size potassium accommodation, resulting in the deconstruction of heterostructures and battery performance fading. Herein, first a stable interface design strategy where two metal chalcogenides with totally different layer&#8208;morphologies are stacked to form large K+ transport channels, rendering ultralow interlayer expansion, is presented. As a proof of concept, the flat&#8211;zigzag MoS2/Bi2S3 heterostructures stacked with zigzag&#8208;morphology Bi2S3 and flat&#8208;morphology MoS2 present an ultralow expansion ratio (1.98%) versus MoS2 (9.66%) and Bi2S3 (9.61%), which deliver an ultrahigh potassium storage capacity of above 600 mAh g&#8722;1 and capacity retention of 76% after 500 cycles, together with the built&#8208;in electric field of heterostructures. Once the heterostructures are used as an anode for potassium&#8208;based dual&#8208;ion batteries (K&#8208;DIBs), it achieves a superior full&#8208;cell capacity of &#8776;166 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 71% after 400 cycles, which is an outstanding performance among the reported K&#8208;DIBs. This proposed interface stacking strategy may offer a new way toward stable heterostructure design for metal ions storage and transport applications.

         <title>Achieving Sustainable and Stable Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries by Leaf&#8208;Bioinspired Nanofluidic Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with nanofluidic flow is proposed. When applied in K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems, the designed sustainable electrodes show advanced steady cycling stability and rapid energy conversion. This biomimetic integrated electrode engineering can enable anisotropic electrolyte flux to achieve regulated surface shielding, which may be a universal way to tackle the shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity electrodes.








Abstract
In nature, living systems have evolved integrated structures, matching optimized nanofluidics to adapt to external conditions. In rechargeable batteries, high&#8208;capacity electrodes are often plagued by the crucial and universal bottleneck of dissolution and shuttle of active substance into electrolyte, posing obstacles of inevitable capacity degradation. Introducing the concept of intelligent nanofluidics to electrodes, a leaf&#8208;bioinspired electrode configuration with hierarchical architecture to tackle this problem is proposed. This integrated structure with fine&#8208;tuned surface pores and unobstructed interior porous media, can spatially control the anisotropic nanofluidic flux, in an efficient and self&#8208;protectable way: tailoring the outflow across the electrode's surface and free transport in interior, to ensure speedy and stable energy conversion. As proofs of concept, applications of sustainable electrodes rejuvenated from fallen leaf and spent commercial batteries, are designed with leaf&#8208;bioinspired architecture. Both K&#63743;CoS2 and K&#63743;S battery systems show advanced steady cycling with effectively mitigated shuttle issues in this smart architecture (0.15% and 0.21% capacity decay per cycle), even at high areal mass loading, when compared with open porous structure (0.60% and 0.39%). This work may pave a new way from a biomimetic view to integrated electrode engineering with regulated surface shielding to conquer the universal dissolution&#8211;shuttle problems facing high&#8208;capacity materials.

         <title>4D Printing of Freestanding Liquid Crystal Elastomers via Hybrid Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hybrid 4D printing method, which integrates laser&#8208;assisted direct ink writing and Digital Light Processing, is developed to fabricate freestanding liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) &#8220;on&#8208;the&#8208;fly&#8221; with optional structural or removable materials. Various architectures, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrities, loading&#8208;bearing actuators, and spatial LCE lattices, can be successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) are appealing candidates among active materials for 4D printing, due to their reversible, programmable and rapid actuation capabilities. Recent progress has been made on direct ink writing (DIW) or Digital Light Processing (DLP) to print LCEs with certain actuation. However, it remains a challenge to achieve complicated structures, such as spatial lattices with large actuation, due to the limitation of printing LCEs on the build platform or the previous layer. Herein, a novel method to 4D print freestanding LCEs on&#8208;the&#8208;fly by using laser&#8208;assisted DIW with an actuation strain up to &#8722;40% is proposed. This process is further hybridized with the DLP method for optional structural or removable supports to create active 3D architectures in a one&#8208;step additive process. Various objects, including hybrid active lattices, active tensegrity, an actuator with tunable stability, and 3D spatial LCE lattices, can be additively fabricated. The combination of DIW&#8208;printed functionally freestanding LCEs with the DLP&#8208;printed supporting structures thus provides new design freedom and fabrication capability for applications including soft robotics, smart structures, active metamaterials, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>Isolating Single and Few Atoms for Enhanced Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have become an attractive frontier in the field of catalysis. The latest advances in synthesis strategies, local environment regulation, and catalytic applications, covering single&#8208;atom, dual&#8208;atom, and atomic cluster catalysts, are reviewed, while practical solutions to inspire the microenvironment regulation of active sites in the isolated few atom systems are provided.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed metal catalysts have triggered great interest in the field of catalysis owing to their unique features. Isolated single or few metal atoms can be anchored on substrates via chemical bonding or space confinement to maximize atom utilization efficiency. The key challenge lies in precisely regulating the geometric and electronic structure of the active metal centers, thus significantly influencing the catalytic properties. Although several reviews have been published on the preparation, characterization, and application of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), the comprehensive understanding of SACs, dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs), and atomic clusters has never been systematically summarized. Here, recent advances in the engineering of local environments of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters for enhanced catalytic performance are highlighted. Firstly, various synthesis approaches for SACs, DACs, and atomic clusters are presented. Then, special attention is focused on the elucidation of local environments in terms of electronic state and coordination structure. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary of isolated single and few atoms for the applications of thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis is provided. Finally, the potential challenges and future opportunities in this emerging field are presented. This review will pave the way to regulate the microenvironment of the active site for boosting catalytic processes.

         <title>Impact of Side&#8208;Chain Hydrophilicity on Packing, Swelling, and Ion Interactions in Oxy&#8208;Bithiophene Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular dynamics and X&#8208;ray diffraction is used to characterize mixed&#8208;transport conjugated polymers packing, ability to swell, and chelate with ions. It is shown that glycol side chains can induce tilted &#960;&#8208;stacks, allow water flow into the lamellar stack, and form single and double bound chelates.








Abstract
Exchanging hydrophobic alkyl&#8208;based side chains to hydrophilic glycol&#8208;based side chains is a widely adopted method for improving mixed&#8208;transport device performance, despite the impact on solid&#8208;state packing and polymer&#8208;electrolyte interactions being poorly understood. Presented here is a molecular dynamics (MD) force field for modeling alkoxylated and glycolated polythiophenes. The force field is validated against known packing motifs for their monomer crystals. MD simulations, coupled with X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), show that alkoxylated polythiophenes will pack with a &#8220;tilted stack&#8221; and straight interdigitating side chains, whilst their glycolated counterpart will pack with a &#8220;deflected stack&#8221; and an s&#8208;bend side&#8208;chain configuration. MD simulations reveal water penetration pathways into the alkoxylated and glycolated crystals&#8212;through the &#960;&#8208;stack and through the lamellar stack respectively. Finally, the two distinct ways triethylene glycol polymers can bind to cations are revealed, showing the formation of a metastable single bound state, or an energetically deep double bound state, both with a strong side&#8208;chain length dependence. The minimum energy pathways for the formation of the chelates are identified, showing the physical process through which cations can bind to one or two side chains of a glycolated polythiophene, with consequences for ion transport in bithiophene semiconductors.

         <title>Reversible Phase Transition for Durable Formamidinium&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the phase transition between &#945; and &#948; phase of formamidinium (FA)1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).








Abstract
Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)&#8208;dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in&#8208;depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase&#8208;stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non&#8208;photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy&#8208;driven &#945;&#8208;to&#8208;&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy&#8208;driven &#948;&#8208;to&#8208;&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs retain &gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase&#8208;transition process of FA1&#8722;xCsxPbI3 from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA&#8208;dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.

     alt="Reversible Phase Transition for Durable Formamidinium-Dominated Perovskite Photovoltaics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The nucleation and growth mechanisms of the phase transition between &#945; and &#948; phase of formamidinium (FA)&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are proposed. Based on these understandings, the lifetime of FA-dominated perovskite solar cells is successfully extended under humidity through either heat healing (leads to &#948;-to-&#945; phase transition) or continuous 60&#160;&#176;C heating (kinetically stabilized &#945; phase).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Phase instability is one of the major obstacles to the wide application of formamidinium (FA)-dominated perovskite solar cells (PSCs). An in-depth investigation on relevant phase transitions is urgently needed to explore more effective phase-stabilization strategies. Herein, the reversible phase-transition process of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite between photoactive phase (&#945; phase) and non-photoactive phase (&#948; phase) under humidity, as well as the reversible healing of degraded devices, is monitored. Moreover, through in situ atomic force microscopy, the kinetic transition between &#945; and &#948; phase is revealed to be the &#8220;nucleation&#8211;growth transition&#8221; process. Density functional theory calculation implies an enthalpy-driven &#945;-to-&#948; degradation process during humidity aging and an entropy-driven &#948;-to-&#945; healing process at high temperatures. The &#945; phase of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be stabilized at elevated temperature under high humidity due to the increased nucleation barrier, and the resulting non-encapsulated PSCs retain &amp;gt;90% of their initial efficiency after &amp;gt;1000 h at 60&#160;&#176;C and 60% relative humidity. This finding provides a deepened understanding on the phase-transition process of FA&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cs&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; from both thermodynamics and kinetics points of view, which also presents an effective means to stabilize the &#945; phase of FA-dominated perovskites and devices for practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV/decade. For silicon or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8208;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15 &#8764; 53 from 300 K to 4 K. We&#160;also report a record high peak current density of 545 kA/cm2 at 4 K for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8764; 0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

         <title>Interspace and Vacancy Modulation: Promoting the Zinc Storage of Alcohol&#8208;Based Organic&#8211;Inorganic Cathode in Water&#8211;Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Expanding interspace and introducing vacancies are desired to promote the mobility of Zn ions and unlock the inactive sites of layered cathode. However, this two&#8208;point modulation has not yet been achieved simultaneously in vanadium phosphate. Here, we propose a strategy for fabricating an alcohol&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8208;xPO4&#8226;0.56C6H14O4, to realise the conjoint modulation of d&#8208;interspace and oxygen vacancies. Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V5+ to V4+ and the intensity of the P&#8208;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realise high chemical reactivity and redox&#8208;center optimisation, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile delivered a long&#8208;term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8764;142&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proved the feasibility to realise the two&#8208;point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high&#8208;performance new 2D materials.

         <title>Efficient and stable perovskite solar cells with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage over 1.2&#160;V achieved by a dual&#8208;side passivation layer</title>

Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, we synthesized a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) and introduced this as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppressed both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenging ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibited a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The nonencapsulated PSCs also showed excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 hours under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>Sprayable hydrogel for instant sealing of vascular anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500,000 cases annually in the US alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially&#8208;available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here we show that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with PAMAM dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic&#8208; and covalent&#8208;interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. We found that our material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8764;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially&#8208;available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility was validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the FDA guidelines, including in&#8208;vitro Neutral Red Uptake (NRU) test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity and guinea&#8208;pig maximization&#8208;test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue:graft interfaces.

Abstract
Lung fibrosis, as one of the major post&#8208;COVID complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, we introduce an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with non&#8208;invasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multi&#8208;culture model under physiologic conditions, we developed a biomimetic ultrathin basement (BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#956;m)&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8208;liquid interface (ALI) and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple co&#8208;culture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. We show the real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which was confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib &#8211;an FDA&#8208;approved anti&#8208;fibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>A Silica Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs). Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8208;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+ transport channels, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte could homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the solid&#8208;like electrolyte. Therefore, the lithium metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8208;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S rich SEI as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still get a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy to on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising paradigm for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by Organoboron Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from more H&#8208;type aggregate into more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurement indicates that addition of BBS improves exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and dissociation of PM6 excitons in PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurement confirms faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals improved charge carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Eliminating the Micropore Confinement Effect of Carbonaceous Electrodes for Promoting Zn&#8208;Ion Storage Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials is boosted by eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously enhancing the utilization of active sites. Systematic ex situ characterizations coupled with in situ electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra certify that the excellent Zn2+ storage capability is attributed to the synergistic effect of Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8211; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and invertible chemical adsorption.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion capacitors (ZICs) are promising technology for large&#8208;scale energy storage by integrating the attributes of supercapacitors and zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Unfortunately, the insufficient Zn2+&#8208;storage active sites of carbonaceous cathode materials and the mismatch of pore sizes with charge carriers lead to unsatisfactory Zn2+ storage capability. Herein, new insights for boosting Zn2+ storage capability of activated nitrogen&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon materials (ANHPC&#8208;x) are&#160;reported by effectively eliminating the micropore confinement effect and synchronously elevating the utilization of active sites. Therefore, the best&#8208;performed ANHPC&#8208;2 delivers impressive electrochemical properties for ZICs in terms of excellent capacity (199.1 mAh g&#8722;1), energy density (155.2&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), and durability (65&#160;000 cycles). Systematic ex situ&#160;characterizations together with in situ&#160;electrochemical quartz crystal microbalance and Raman spectra measurements reveal that the remarkable electrochemical performance is assigned to the synergism of the Zn2+, H+, and SO42&#8722; co&#8208;adsorption mechanism and reversible chemical adsorption. Furthermore, the ANHPC&#8208;2&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZIC demonstrates excellent electrochemical capability with an ultralong lifespan of up to 100 000 cycles. This work not only provides a promising strategy to improve the Zn2+ storage capability of carbonaceous materials but also sheds lights on charge&#8208;storage mechanism and advanced electrode materials&#8217; design for ZICs toward practical applications.

         <title>Ionogel&#8208;Based Membranes for Safe Lithium/Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices have attracted extensive interest because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. The most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes in lithium/sodium batteries are summarized. In addition, the current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are proposed.








Abstract
Alkali (lithium, sodium)&#8208;based second batteries are considered one of the brightest candidates for energy&#8208;storage applications in order to utilize the random and intermittent renewable energy to achieve carbon neutrality. Conventional lithium/sodium batteries containing liquid organic electrolytes are vulnerable to electrolytes leakage and even combustion, which hinders their large&#8208;scale and reliable application. All&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes which are considered to have better safety have been developed in recent years. However, most of them suffer from low ionic conductivity and large interfacial resistance with the electrode. Ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes composed of ionic liquids and solid matrices, have attracted much attention because of their nonvolatility, nonflammability, and superior chemical and electrochemical properties. This review focuses on the most recent advances of ionogel electrolytes that sprang up with the emerging demand and progress of safe lithium/sodium batteries. The ionogel&#8208;electrolyte membranes are discussed based on the framework components and preparation methods. Their structure and properties, including ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, electrochemical stabilities, and so on, are demonstrated in combination with their applications. The current challenges and insights on the future development of ionogel electrolytes for advanced safe lithium/sodium batteries are also proposed.

         <title>Efficient and Stable 3D/2D Perovskite Solar Cells through Vertical Heterostructures with (BA)4AgBiBr8 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(BA)4AgBiBr8 2D perovskite nanosheets are used to construct vertical heterostructures with 3D perovskite to serve as a barrier layer to suppress the ion diffusion and nonradiation recombination from 3D perovskite to metal electrode. The performance and stability of perovskite solar cells are simultaneously enhanced after the incorporation of the 2D nanosheets.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PVSCs) have drawn great attention due to their high processability and superior photovoltaic properties. However, their further development is often hindered by severe nonradiative recombination at interfaces that decreases power conversion efficiency (PCE). To this end, a facile strategy to construct a 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to reduce the energy loss in PVSCs is developed. The heterostructure is contrived through the van der Waals integration of 2D perovskite ((BA)4AgBiBr8) nanosheets onto the surface of 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites. The large bandgap of (BA)4AgBiBr8 enables the formation of type&#8208;I heterojunction with 3D&#8208;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskites, which serves as a barrier to suppress the trap&#8208;assisted recombination at the interface. As a result, a satisfying PCE of 24.48% is achieved with an improved open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) from 1.13 to 1.17&#160;V. Moreover, the 2D perovskite nanosheets can effectively mitigate the iodide ion diffusion from perovskite to the metal electrode, hence enhancing the device stability. 3D/2D architectured devices retain &#8776;90% of their initial PCE under continuous illumination or heating after 1000 h, which are superior to 3D&#8208;based devices. This work provides an effective and controllable strategy to construct 3D/2D vertical heterostructure to simultaneously boost the efficiency and stability of PVSCs.

         <title>Enabling High&#8208;Voltage &#8220;Superconcentrated Ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;Ceramic&#8221; Hybrid Electrolyte with Ultrahigh Ionic Conductivity and Single Li+&#8208;Ion Transference Number</title>

         <dc:description>
A unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; electrolyte is newly developed by conglutinating garnet with superconcentrated ionogel. Such electrolyte not only demonstrates a superior ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, but also a large Li+&#8208;ion transference number of 0.89. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries using this electrolyte reveal excellent cycling performance.








Abstract
High room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivities, large Li+&#8208;ion transference numbers, and good compatibility with both Li&#8208;metal anodes and high&#8208;voltage cathodes of the solid electrolytes are the essential requirements for practical solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a unique &#8220;superconcentrated ionogel&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; (SIC) electrolyte prepared by an in situ thermally initiated radical polymerization is reported. Solid&#8208;state static 7Li NMR and molecular dynamics simulation reveal the roles of ceramic in Li+ local environments and transport in the SIC electrolyte. The SIC electrolyte not only exhibits an ultrahigh ionic conductivity of 1.33 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C, but also a Li+&#8208;ion transference number as high as 0.89, together with a low electronic conductivity of 3.14 &#215; 10&#8722;10 S cm&#8722;1 and a wide electrochemical stability window of 5.5&#160;V versus Li/Li+. Applications of the SIC electrolyte in Li||LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 and Li||LiFePO4 batteries further demonstrate the high rate and long cycle life. This study, therefore, provides a promising hybrid electrolyte for safe and high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>3D Printing Flexible Sodium&#8208;Ion Microbatteries with Ultrahigh Areal Capacity and Robust Rate Capability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A prototype of fully 3D&#8208;printed planar flexible sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes via multilayer printing for ultrahigh areal capacity and robust rate capability, benefiting from the elaborate printable inks and impressive ion/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion microbatteries (NIMBs) constructed using low&#8208;cost and abundant raw materials in planar configuration with both cathode and anode on the same substrate hold promise for powering coplanar microelectronics, but are hindered by the low areal capacity owing to the thin microelectrodes. Here, a prototype of planar and flexible 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs is demonstrated with 3D interconnected conductive thick microelectrodes for ultrahigh areal capacity and boosted rate capability. Rationally optimized 3D printable inks with appropriate viscosities and high conductivity allow the multilayer printing of NIMB microelectrodes reaching a very high thickness of &#8776;1200&#160;&#181;m while maintaining effective ion and electron&#8208;transfer pathways in them. Consequently, the 3D&#8208;printed NIMBs deliver superior areal capacity of 4.5 mAh cm&#8722;2 (2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed microbatteries. The NIMBs show enhanced rate capability with 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 40&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and robust long&#8208;term cycle life up to 6000 cycles. Furthermore, the planar NIMB microelectrodes, despite the large thickness, exhibit decent mechanical flexibility under various bending conditions. This work opens a new avenue for the construction of high&#8208;performance NIMBs with thick microelectrodes capable of powering flexible microelectronics.

         <title>Edge&#8208;Site Engineering of Defective Fe&#8211;N4 Nanozymes with Boosted Catalase&#8208;Like Performance for Retinal Vasculopathies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iron single&#8208;atom nanozyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) with defective Fe&#8211;N4 sites is fabricated by edge&#8208;site engineering. The abundant edge&#8208;hosted Fe&#8211;N4 sites endow Fe&#8208;SANzyme with boosted catalase&#8208;like activity, which is significantly higher than the reference with integral Fe&#8211;N4 sites. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, pathological vascular dysfunction is effectively alleviated in animal models of retinal vasculopathies treated with antioxidant Fe&#8208;SANzyme.








Abstract
Extensive efforts are devoted to refining metal sites for optimizing the catalytic performance of single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SANzymes), while the contribution of the defect environment of neighboring metal sites lacks attention. Herein, an iron&#8208;based SANzyme (Fe&#8208;SANzyme) is rationally designed by edge&#8208;site engineering, which intensively exposes edge&#8208;hosted defective Fe&#8211;N4 atomic sites anchored in hierarchical mesoporous structures. The Fe&#8208;SANzyme exhibits excellent catalase&#8208;like activity capable of efficiently catalyzing the decomposition of H2O2 into O2 and H2O, with a catalytic kinetic KM value superior to that of natural catalase and reported nanozymes. The mechanistic studies depict that the defects introduce notable charge transfer from the Fe atom to the carbon matrix, making the central Fe more activated to strengthen the interaction with H2O2 and weaken the O&#63743;O bond. By performing catalase&#8208;like catalysis, the Fe&#8208;SANzyme significantly scavenges reactive oxygen species (ROS) and alleviates oxidative stress, thus eliminating the pathological angiogenesis in animal models of retinal vasculopathies without affecting the repair of normal vessels. This work provides a new way to refine SANzymes by engineering the defect environment and geometric structure around metal sites, and demonstrates the potential therapeutic effects of the nanozyme on retinal vasculopathies.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal Catalysts for Boosted Lithium Polysulfides Redox Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gallium&#8211;tin alloy, one of the promising liquid metals at room temperature, is applied to lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries as a novel liquid electrocatalyst with a dynamic feature, which can drastically reduce the activation energy barrier of the lithium polysulfides redox reaction, enhance the overall electrochemical kinetics, and achieve improvement of the specific energy density of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Designing efficient electrocatalysts with high electroconductivity, strong chemisorption, and superior catalytical efficiency to realize rapid kinetics of the lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) conversion process is crucial for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery applications. Unfortunately, most current electrocatalysts cannot maintain long&#8208;term stability due to the possible failure of catalytic sites. Herein, a novel dynamic electrocatalytic strategy with the liquid metal (i.e., gallium&#8211;tin, EGaSn) to facilitate LiPSs redox reaction is reported. The combined theoretical simulations and microstructure experiment analysis reveal that Sn atoms dynamically distributed in the liquid Ga matrix act as the main active catalytic center. Meanwhile, Ga provides a uniquely dynamic environment to maintain the long&#8208;term integrity of the catalytic system. With the participation of EGaSn, a tailor&#8208;made 2 Ah Li&#8211;S pouch cell with a specific energy density of 307.7&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is realized. This work opens up new opportunities for liquid&#8208;phase binary alloys as electrocatalysts for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Atomically Thin Synapse Networks on Van Der Waals Photo&#8208;Memtransistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of an atomistic synaptic network on an atomically thin van der Waals heterostructure, where the ultrasmall cells built with trilayer tungsten disulfide (WS2) semiconductor serve as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, is demonstrated. UV pulses onto the memristor generate dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, leading to the accurate modulation of the synaptic cells.








Abstract
A new type of atomically thin synaptic network on van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is reported, where each ultrasmall cell (&#8776;2&#160;nm thick) built with trilayer WS2 semiconductor acts as a gate&#8208;tunable photoactive synapse, i.e., a photo&#8208;memtransistor. A train of UV pulses onto the WS2 memristor generates dopants in atomic&#8208;level precision by direct light&#8211;lattice interactions, which, along with the gate tunability, leads to the accurate modulation of the channel conductance for potentiation and depression of the synaptic cells. Such synaptic dynamics can be explained by a parallel atomistic resistor network model. In addition, it is shown that such a device scheme can generally be realized in other 2D vdW semiconductors, such as MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2, and WSe2. Demonstration of these atomically thin photo&#8208;memtransistor arrays, where the synaptic weights can be tuned for the atomistic defect density, provides implications for a new type of artificial neural networks for parallel matrix computations with an ultrahigh integration density.

         <title>A 2D Nanoradiosensitizer Enhances Radiotherapy and Delivers STING Agonists to Potentiate Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) functions as a potent nanoradiosensitizer and a nanocarrier for agonists of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) for cancer treatment. STING agonists are conjugated onto an MOL via phosphate linkages, resulting in prolonged tumor retention and enhanced STING activation. Further combination with immune checkpoint blockade extends the scope of this local treatment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.








Abstract
Despite potent preclinical antitumor activity, activation of stimulator of interferon genes (STING) has shown modest therapeutic effects in clinical studies. Many STING agonists, including 2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate (cGAMP), show poor pharmacokinetic properties for sustaining STING activation in tumors and achieving optimal antitumor efficacy. Improved delivery of STING agonists and their effective combination with other treatments are needed to enhance their therapeutic effects. Herein, a 2D nanoplatform, cGAMP/MOL, is reported via conjugating cGAMP to a nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layer (MOL) for simultaneous STING activation and radiosensitization. The MOL not only exhibits strong radiosensitization effects for enhanced cancer killing and induction of immunogenic cell death, but also retains cGAMP in tumors for sustained STING activation. Compared to free cGAMP, cGAMP/MOL elicits stronger STING activation and regresses local tumors upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Further combination with an immune checkpoint inhibitor bridges innate and adaptive immune systems by activating the tumor microenvironment to elicit systemic antitumor responses.

         <title>Ultratough Hydrogen&#8208;Bond&#8208;Bridged Phosphorene Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultratough hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films, which exhibit much higher Young's modulus (316&#160;GPa) than the theoretical value (94&#160;GPa) of black phosphorene, are prepared using the electrochemical intercalation method and further proved by physical characterizations. The underlying mechanism of its excellent mechanical properties is revealed using theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rapid development of flexible electronic devices, especially based on 2D materials, has triggered the demand for high&#8208;strength materials. Mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer phosphorene with excellent electronic properties has attracted extensive attention. However, phosphorene is affected by its low Young's modulus when applied to flexible electronic devices. Here, a strategy via ion intercalation to significantly improve the mechanical properties of black phosphorus to generate hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;bridged phosphorene films with Young's modulus as high as 316&#160;GPa is reported. This value is several times larger than the theoretical values of 166&#160;GPa in the zigzag direction, 44&#160;GPa in the armchair direction, and the averaged Young's modulus among all directions of 94&#160;GPa. The impact of intercalation on mechanical properties is also explored. Experimental nanoindentation results obtained by atomic force microscopy indicate that the relationship between the ratio of intercalated ions to phosphorus atoms and the corresponding Young's modulus satisfies the formula E=eae&#8722;[ln(x)+b]2c(0&lt;x&#8804;1.80)\[E{\bm{ = }}{e^{a{e^{\frac{{{\bm{ - }}{{[\ln (x){\bm{ + }}b]}^2}}}{c}}}}}(0{\bm{ &amp;lt; }}x{\bm{ \le }}1.80)\]. Furthermore, a flexible NO2 gas sensor device based on this ultratough material presents excellent performance, even after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. The results provide new insight into the potential for practical applications of black phosphorus devices.

         <title>Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the specific binding between the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW) and Escherichia coli strains, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to regulate the gut microbiome. CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.








Abstract
Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of Escherichia coli during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, a bionic regulator (CaWO4@YCW) is developed to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of E. coli during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of E. coli strains to the mannose&#8208;rich yeast cell wall (YCW), YCW is chosen as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO4. It is demonstrated that the YCW shell endows CaWO4 with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded E. coli in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO4, thus inhibiting E. coli growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO4@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS&#8208;induced colitis.

     alt="Bionic Regulators Break the Ecological Niche of Pathogenic Bacteria for Modulating Dysregulated Microbiome in Colitis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the specific binding between the mannose-rich yeast cell wall (YCW) and &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; strains, a bionic regulator (CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@YCW) is developed to regulate the gut microbiome. CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS-induced colitis.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Therapeutic approaches that reprogram the gut microbiome are promising strategies to alleviate and cure inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, abnormal expansion of &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; during inflammation can promote pathogenic bacteria occupying ecological niches to resist reprogramming of the microbiome. Herein, a bionic regulator (CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@YCW) is developed to efficiently and precisely regulate the gut microbiome by specifically suppressing the abnormal expansion of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; during colitis and boosting probiotic growth. Inspired by the binding of &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; strains to the mannose-rich yeast cell wall (YCW), YCW is chosen as the bionic shell to encapsulate CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is demonstrated that the YCW shell endows CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; with superior resistance to the harsh environment of the gastrointestinal tract and adheres to the abnormally expanded &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; in colitis, specifically as a positioner. Notably, the high expression of calprotectin at the colitis site triggers the release of tungsten ions through calcium deprivation in CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, thus inhibiting &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; growth by replacing molybdenum in the molybdopterin cofactor. Moreover, YCW functions as a prebiotic and promotes probiotic growth. Consequently, CaWO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;@YCW can efficiently and precisely reprogram the gut microbiome by eliminating pathogenic bacteria and providing prebiotics, resulting in an extraordinary therapeutic advantage for DSS-induced colitis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Challenging Bendable Organic Single Crystal and Transistor Arrays with High Mobility and Durability toward Flexible Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area, ultrathin, and highly aligned organic single&#8208;crystal arrays are readily available for flexible electronics through a polymer&#8208;template&#8208;assisted molecular&#8208;assembly strategy. The proposed strategy is shown to be applicable to a variety of semiconductor molecules, demonstrating its effectiveness. The resulting transistor devices exhibit high mobility, low operating voltage, and high bendable durability.








Abstract
Bendable organic single crystals are promising candidates for flexible electronics owing to their superior charge&#8208;transport properties. However, large&#8208;area high&#8208;quality organic single crystals are rarely available on the polymer substrates generally used in flexible electronics. Here, a surface&#8208;assisted assembly strategy based on a polymer modification, poly(amic acid) (PAA), is developed to grow large&#8208;area organic singe crystals on polymer substrates using a simple drop&#8208;casting method. The unique surface properties of PAA that enable molecular solution superwetting and promote molecular ordered assembly produce an extraordinary self&#8208;driven &#8220;meniscus&#8208;guided coating&#8221; behavior, enabling the fabrication of millimeter&#8208;sized, highly aligned organic single crystals for a variety of organic semiconductors. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on a mode molecule of 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1]benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzothiophene demonstrate the highest (average) mobility of 18.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (15.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1), attractively low operating voltage of &#8722;3&#160;V, and high flexible durability. The results shed light on the large&#8208;area fabrication of organic single crystals on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance and integrated plastic electronics.

         <title>Phase Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals Enabled Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy as well as high contrast biomedical imaging was proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8208;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia and multimodal imaging capability. The bismuth&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency, and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieved evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under CT, MRI and thermograph for consistent tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibited improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15 after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <title>Fully Depleted Self&#8208;Aligned Heterosandwiched Van Der Waals Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel metal&#8208;mirror&#8208;enhanced n&#8211;p&#8211;n van der Waals heterostructure is designed. The device exhibits excellent performance including high blackbody photoresponsivity up to 0.77 A W&#8722;1, high specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation, and fast response speed of &#8776;4 &#181;s.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature&#8208;operating highly sensitive mid&#8208;wavelength&#160;infrared (MWIR) photodetectors are utilized in a large number of important applications, including night vision, communications, and optical radar. Many previous studies have demonstrated uncooled MWIR photodetectors using 2D narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductors. To date, most of these works have utilized atomically thin flakes, simple van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures, or atomically thin p&#8211;n junctions as absorbers, which have difficulty in meeting the requirements for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors with a blackbody response. Here, a fully depleted self&#8208;aligned MoS2&#8208;BP&#8208;MoS2 vdW heterostructure sandwiched between two electrodes is reported. This new type of photodetector exhibits competitive performance, including a high blackbody peak photoresponsivity up to 0.77&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 and low noise&#8208;equivalent power of 2.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;14&#160;W&#160;Hz&#8722;1/2, in the MWIR region. A peak specific detectivity of 8.61&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;cm Hz1/2&#160;W&#8722;1 under blackbody radiation is achieved at room temperature in the MWIR region. Importantly, the effective detection range of the device is twice that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MWIR photodetectors. Furthermore, the device presents an ultrafast response of &#8776;4&#160;&#181;s both in the visible and short&#8208;wavelength infrared bands. These results provide an ideal platform for realizing broadband and highly sensitive room&#8208;temperature MWIR photodetectors.

         <title>Approaching the External Quantum Efficiency Limit in 2D Photovoltaic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing 2D photovoltaic devices with high performances is demonstrated. The device based on 2D WS2 exhibits nearly ideal external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 92% and high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 5.0%, which are attributed to the defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising candidates for realizing ultrathin and high&#8208;performance photovoltaic devices. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of most 2D photovoltaic devices face great challenges in exceeding 50% and 3%, respectively, due to the low efficiency of photocarrier separation and collection. Here, this study demonstrates photovoltaic devices with defect&#8208;free interface and recombination&#8208;free channel based on 2D WS2, showing high EQE of 92% approaching the theoretical limit and high PCE of 5.0%. The high performances are attributed to the van der Waals metal contact without interface defects and Fermi&#8208;level pinning, and the fully depleted channel without photocarrier recombination, leading to intrinsic photocarrier separation and collection with high efficiency. Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe2 and WSe2 with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high&#8208;performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.

Furthermore, this study demonstrates that the strategy can be extended to other TMDs such as MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and WSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with EQE of 92% and 94%, respectively. This work proposes a universal strategy for building high-performance 2D photovoltaic devices. The nearly ideal EQE provides great potential for PCE approaching the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bottom&#8208;Up Interfacial Design of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Highly Efficient and Selective Electrocatalysis of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks enable the integration of electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces via one&#8208;pot polycondensation reaction into well&#8208;defined catalytic skeletons, so that the ordered &#960; skeletons promote electron motion and the hydrophobic channels facilitate CO2 delivery to the catalytic centers. The systematic interface design boosts catalytic activity and selectivity to achieve a benchmark electrocatalytic CO2 reduction.








Abstract
Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom&#8208;up introduction of segregated electron&#8208;conduction and mass&#8208;transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70&#8208;fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO2 transformation under ambient conditions. The results open a way to precise interfacial design of actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO2.

&lt;p&gt;Assembling molecular catalytic centers into crosslinked networks is widely used to fabricate heterogeneous catalysts but they often suffer loss in activity and selectivity accompanied by unclear causes. Here, a strategy for the construction of heterogeneous catalysts to induce activity and selectivity by bottom-up introduction of segregated electron-conduction and mass-transport interfaces into the catalytic materials is reported. The catalytic skeletons are designed to possess different &#960; orderings for electron motion and the open channels are tailored to install finely engineered walls for mass transport, so that origins of activity and selectivity are correlated. The resultant covalent organic framework catalysts with ordered &#960; skeletons and solvophobic pores increase activity by two orders of magnitude, enhance selectivity and energy efficiency by 70-fold, and broaden the voltage range, to promote CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transformation under ambient conditions. The results open a way to precise interfacial design of actionable heterogeneous catalysts for producing feedstocks from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
