         <title>Dual&#8208;Path Exciton Harvesting Guided by Molecular Packing and Orientation Achieves Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chrysene&#8208;based deep&#8208;blue emitter, PChCz, delivers 21.3% EQE through high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing (hRISC). Co&#8208;deposition with a sensitizer enables triplet recycling via triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation (TTA), raising the EQE to 25.5% with reduced roll&#8208;off. This dual&#8208;path exciton&#8208;harvesting strategy, supported by optimized molecular mixing and orientation, provides an effective route toward high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.








ABSTRACT
Efficient and color&#8208;pure deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) are of critical significance for next&#8208;generation display technologies, yet the realization remains challenging owing to the stringent requirements of wide bandgap emitters, inefficient exciton utilization, and pronounced efficiency roll&#8208;off. In this study, we proposed a dual&#8208;path exciton harvesting strategy that combines high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing with triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation to improve exciton utilization. The new deep&#8208;blue emitter PChCz, based on the chrysene moiety, exhibits favorable high&#8208;energy reverse intersystem crossing from high&#8208;lying triplet states, enabling non&#8208;doped OLEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.3%. To alleviate triplet&#8208;polaron annihilation at elevated current densities, a co&#8208;deposited sensitizer is employed to reutilize low&#8208;energy triplet via the triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation mechanism, thereby further improving the external quantum efficiency to 25.5% with suppressed roll&#8208;off. Morphological analysis reveals that co&#8208;deposition enhances compositional homogeneity and optimizes molecular orientation, which are conducive to efficient energy transfer and light outcoupling. Supported by rational molecular design and morphological control, the proposed dual&#8208;path exciton harvesting mechanism presents an effective approach for the development of high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Engineered Oligomeric Indolizine&#8208;Fused BODIPY Fluorophores for Interventional NIR&#8208;II Fluorescence Imaging of Acute Cardio&#8208;Cerebrovascular Events</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Our work represents a pivotal advancement in the design of indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY oligomers, specifically engineered for interventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging of acute cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular events.








ABSTRACT
Vascular networks are essential for life maintenance, and their dysfunction can result in severe diseases. However, current biomedical imaging modalities possess constraints in diagnosing these diseases. NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging has emerged as a powerful tool, offering rapid feedback, high spatial resolution, and superior biosafety. Among NIR&#8208;II fluorophores, BODIPY oligomers stand out due to their excellent optical performance and versatile tunability. Yet, they confront challenges in design, synthesis, brightness, and blood circulation half&#8208;life. Here, we introduce a novel approach that integrates vascular interventional techniques with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging, utilizing de&#8208;novo designed and synthesized indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY oligomers for diagnosing cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular diseases. The synthesized oligomers absorb and emit within the NIR&#8208;II window. Notably, (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4, a representative singly indolizine&#8208;fused tetramer, features highly planar indolizine&#8208;fused BODIPY subunits with a twisted linkage, mitigating detrimental aggregation via suppressed intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions. Consequently, (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4 demonstrates high brightness, a substantial Stokes shift, and robust chemical and photostability. ((&#945;&#945;SIFB)4@PSMA) exhibits remarkable performance in imaging mouse cardio&#8208;cerebral vasculature. Crucially, direct administration via a interventional catheter addresses the issue of short blood circulation half&#8208;life, significantly enhancing target&#8208;site contrast. Interventional NIR&#8208;II imaging with (&#945;&#945;SIFB)4@PSMA enables real&#8208;time, continuous monitoring of vascular dynamics and visualization of acute cardio&#8208;cerebrovascular events.

         <title>Melt Densification Enables Fracture&#8208;Resistant Blend Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt densification of miscible polymers enables the formation of highly entangled blend hydrogels with exceptional fracture resistance. The resulting networks combine high stiffness and fatigue thresholds with optical transparency, oxygen permeability, and antifouling performance. This generalizable approach provides a straightforward strategy to design robust functional hydrogels for biomedical and electronic applications.








ABSTRACT
Hydrogels and elastomers are integral components in biomedical and electronics devices, but their toughness and crack resistance are often unsatisfactory for load&#8208;bearing applications. Synthetic polymer networks predominantly rely on solution fabrication, which compromises the ultimate mechanical properties. This work presents a universal melt crosslinking strategy, which densifies entanglements well beyond solvated conditions. When deformed, mutually entangled dissimilar chains stiffen the gels, while sparse crosslinks amplify fracture resistance. At water contents up to 83%, the resultant hydrogels demonstrate over 2 orders increase in mechanical properties, including moduli (1.3&#8211;35 MPa), toughness (0.7&#8211;24.5 kJ/m2), and fatigue thresholds (1.2&#8211;3.3 kJ/m2), tunable in a wide range beyond existing hydrogels. Furthermore, the hydrogels show high optical clarity (&gt;96%), oxygen permeability (Dk/t &gt; 40), and anti&#8208;fouling properties (&lt;0.6&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2). This generalizable strategy could guide the design of tough functional soft materials in fields such as healthcare and smart electronics.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Self&#8208;Supply Synthesis of Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe2Mo3O8 Semiconductor Single Crystal With Colossal Ferroelectric Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oxygen&#8208;self&#8208;supply CVD strategy is designed to synthesize a 2D Fe2Mo3O8 ferroelectric semiconductor. The FeO4 tetrahedral cage contributes to the long displacement of the iron ion and induces the generation of large polarization. Oxygen&#8208;deficient growth environment and ultrathin thickness enable the generation of oxygen vacancy/lattice distortion, which further enhances the polarization. As expected, ultrahigh polarization and ultralong endurance are achieved in Fe2Mo3O8.2








ABSTRACT
Developing ferroelectric semiconductors with colossal polarizations is crucial for fabricating large&#8208;capacity/high&#8208;density memory devices to meet the artificial intelligence demands. Although remarkable ferroelectric polarizations have been uncovered in perovskite&#8208;type oxides, the compatibility with electronic device scaling is becoming an insurmountable bottleneck. Here, we design an oxygen&#8208;self&#8208;supply chemical vapor deposition strategy to synthesize a 2D ferroelectric semiconductor single crystal of Fe2Mo3O8. The unique FeO4 tetrahedral cage contributes to the long displacement of the iron ion and induces the generation of large polarization. In parallel, the oxygen&#8208;deficient growth environment and ultrathin thickness enable the generation of oxygen vacancies and lattice distortion, which further enhance the ferroelectric polarization. As expected, ultrahigh polarization value up to 230 &#181;C/cm2 and ultralong endurance (4 &#215; 109 cycles) are achieved in 2D Fe2Mo3O8, ten to one hundred times larger than most 2D ferroelectric materials. Concurrently, ferroelectric tunnel junctions based on 2D Fe2Mo3O8 exhibit high switching speed and long retention time. This work represents a substantial leap for developing new 2D ferroelectric semiconductors with giant polarizations, which will stimulate the further exploration of large&#8208;capacity/high&#8208;density memory chips to overcome von Neumann architecture bottlenecks.

         <title>Amorphous Engineering of Transparent High&#8208;Crystallinity Luminescent Nano&#8208;Glass&#8208;Ceramics for Advanced Photonic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a universal amorphous engineering approach that combines amorphous phase separation and glass&#8208;network confinement to achieve ultra&#8208;high crystallinity (&gt;90%) and high optical transparency (&gt;90%) in transparent glass&#8208;ceramics, overcoming the low crystallinity limitation and demonstrating its applicability across various material systems, with potential for advanced optical technologies such as transparent displays, laser&#8208;driven lighting, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








ABSTRACT
Transparent glass&#8208;ceramics are promising materials for advanced applications, but their development is fundamentally constrained by low crystallinity (&lt;70%), leading to significant &#8220;performance deterioration&#8221;. In order to overcome this bottleneck, this study proposes a universal amorphous engineering approach, which synergistically exploits amorphous phase separation and glass&#8208;network confinement. This method promotes heterogeneous nucleation at phase boundaries and spatially restricts crystal growth, achieving ultra&#8208;high crystallinity (&gt; 90%) while maintaining high optical transparency (&gt; 90%). Unlike conventional approaches that rely on specific compositions or crystallization pathways, this broadly adaptable strategy has been successfully extended to fluoride, oxide, perovskite, and sulfide&#8208;based glass&#8208;ceramics, demonstrating its versatility. Upon rare&#8208;earth doping, the composites exhibit superior performance in transparent displays, laser&#8208;driven lighting, and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The results provide an adaptable strategy for next&#8208;generation photonic materials in advanced optical technologies.

         <title>An Immune Nanoenhancer Revitalizes Chemotherapeutics to Tailor Tumor&#8208;Derived dsDNA for Anticancer Immunoengineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An immune nanoenhancer transforms machine learning&#8208;optimized chemotherapeutics into potent inducers of immunogenic tumor&#8208;derived DNA, overcoming barriers to cGAS&#8208;STING activation. By integrating rational drug optimization, tumor&#8208;selective delivery, and robust dsDNA release, this platform enables precise immune reprogramming and durable antitumor responses, exemplifying the power of materials design in next&#8208;generation cancer immunotherapy.








ABSTRACT
Immunotherapy has revolutionized the landscape of cancer treatment; however, most current strategies target only isolated steps of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle and therefore struggle to achieve durable clinical success. Central to immune surveillance, the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway orchestrates innate and adaptive responses by promoting dendritic cell maturation, cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, and durable immunological memory. However, chemotherapeutic activation of this axis remains elusive due to a paucity of safe, efficacious, and translatable inducers of tumor&#8208;derived double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA). Here, we report a rationally engineered immune nanoenhancer platform&#8211;C&#8208;iNE/A, that reprograms approved chemotherapeutics to initiate robust dsDNA&#8208;driven cGAS&#8208;STING activation in tumors even at low drug doses. Guided by machine learning, we optimize chemotherapeutic encapsulation and combine it with photophysically triggered mild hyperthermia to impair DNA repair while sparing healthy tissues. This cascade promotes intratumoral dsDNA accumulation, immunogenic release, and sustained immune activation. C&#8208;iNE/A elicited potent immune responses across tumor models, enhancing dendritic cell maturation, amplifying cytotoxic T lymphocyte infiltration, suppressing metastasis, and establishing memory T cell populations. Our approach establishes a generalizable strategy to convert conventional chemotherapeutics into immune activators at safe drug doses, offering a clinically relevant platform to overcome current limitations in STING&#8208;based immunotherapy and advance the next generation of tumor&#8208;immunomodulatory regimens.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Zero&#8208;Gap Glycerol&#8208;Fed Electrolyzer for C3 Chemicals and Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a dynamic, self&#8208;regulating operation strategy that enables selective glycerol electrooxidation in the OER&#8208;free regime, co&#8208;producing C3 chemicals and hydrogen at cell voltages below 1.25 V. Voltage&#8208; and temperature&#8208;resolved analyses define optimal operating conditions, achieving a sustained current density of 500 mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8764;1.21 V with &gt;88% C3 selectivity. This work establishes a mechanistically grounded pathway for high conversion, low&#8208;voltage glycerol electrooxidation.








ABSTRACT
The electrochemical oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol offers a promising low&#8208;voltage alternative to water oxidation in electrolyzers, enabling the co&#8208;production of hydrogen and value&#8208;added chemicals. However, achieving high conversion rates at current densities above 300&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 remains challenging due to the rapid deactivation of platinum&#8208;based catalysts. Here, we present a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) featuring a platinum&#8208;decorated nickel foam (Pt/NiF) anode that sustains operation for 24&#160;h at 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with an average cell voltage of just 1.21&#160;V, outperforming all previously reported glycerol&#8208;fed electrolyzers operating below 1.5&#160;V. The system exhibits &gt;88% selectivity toward C3 products, achieving 227&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 partial current density for lactic acid and 9% single&#8208;pass glycerol conversion. In situ impedance spectroscopy identifies voltage&#8208;dependent regimes linked to platinum hydroxide formation, glycerol oxidation, and oxygen evolution. Systematic variation of electrolyte composition and temperature reveals an optimized window (1.2&#8211;1.4&#160;V, 55&#8211;65&#176;C) for sustained performance. Under these conditions, a single 24 h cycle co&#8208;generates &#8764;175&#160;mmol of H2 and 45&#160;mmol of C3 products. These results establish new operational and mechanistic benchmarks for efficient, low&#8208;voltage electrochemical valorization of biomass&#8208;derived polyols at industrially relevant rates.

         <title>A Retina&#8208;Inspired Organic Iono&#8208;Optoelectronic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retina&#8208;inspired organic photoelectrochemical transistor integrates light sensing with ionic charge modulation using a p&#8208;type mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor and an ionic liquid. Acting as both the light absorber and the semiconducting channel and gate of the transistor, the material enables broadband photodetection and synaptic plasticity akin to retinal processing, generating a building block for biohybrid vision systems.








ABSTRACT
Retina&#8208;inspired neuromorphic systems require seamless integration of light sensing and adaptive synaptic modulation, yet conventional materials fail to integrate ionic charge transport with optoelectronic signal processing. Organic iono&#8208;optoelectronic devices offer a promising solution by coupling the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers with ionic and electronic transport. Here, we present an organic iono&#8208;optoelectronic synapse enabled by a p&#8208;type mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor (OMIEC). The OMIEC material, gDPP&#8208;MeOT2, a donor&#8208;acceptor polymer comprising a thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole acceptor and methoxy&#8208;bithiophene donor, serves simultaneously as a light absorber and an ion reservoir, enabling light&#8208;modulated mixed charge transport. Our iono&#8208;optoelectronic synapse exhibits broad&#8208;band light detection spanning the visible to near&#8208;infrared range and synaptic plasticity features central to learning processes of the human brain. These results suggest that OMIECs can unify light detection, logic operation, and energy&#8208;efficient information processing, paving the way for next generation biohybrid vision systems and bio&#8208;inspired neuromorphic electronics.

         <title>Energy&#8208;Efficient, Sustainable Cascade Glucose Electrooxidation into Glucaric Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a tandem system that efficiently converts glucose into glucaric acid while generating renewable electricity. By decoupling the oxidation process into two cascaded steps, the system achieves an overall 90% Faradaic efficiency and 80% conversion efficiency at &#8764;0.6 VRHE, significantly reducing energy consumption compared to traditional one&#8208;step routes at &gt;1.2 VRHE.








ABSTRACT
Glucaric acid (GRA) is a critical platform chemical for manufacturing biodegradable materials. Selective glucose (GLU) electrooxidation into GRA provides a sustainable route for biomass valorization. However, conventional methods suffer from energy&#8208;intensive processes due to excessive operational potential exceeding 1.2&#160;V. Here we demonstrate an energy&#8208;efficient tandem system that decouples GRA electrosynthesis into cascade GLU&#8208;to&#8208;gluconic acid (GNA) and GNA&#8208;to&#8208;GRA oxidation. When pairing an Au/C catalyst for selective aldehyde oxidation and an AuPt/C catalyst for hydroxyl oxidation, we achieve 91.8% Faradaic efficiency and nearly 100% conversion efficiency at 0.6 VRHE for GLU&#8208;to&#8208;GNA oxidation, and 81% Faradaic efficiency and 90% conversion efficiency at 0.55 VRHE for GNA&#8208;to&#8208;GRA oxidation. Chronoamperometry demonstrates &#8764;100% substrate conversion with a minor decrease in product selectivity, confirming the catalyst's excellent stability. Our tandem system improves the overall GLU&#8208;to&#8208;GRA energy efficiency from 13.8% for conventional one&#8208;step route to 31.8%. When oxygen reduction is selected as paired reaction, our system not only enables efficient chemical electrosynthesis, but is also estimated to generate electricity of 1.24 &#215; 105&#160;kWh per kiloton GRA, outperforming traditional method with energy consumption of 4.31 &#215; 105&#160;kWh.

     alt="Energy-Efficient, Sustainable Cascade Glucose Electrooxidation into Glucaric Acid"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This study presents a tandem system that efficiently converts glucose into glucaric acid while generating renewable electricity. By decoupling the oxidation process into two cascaded steps, the system achieves an overall 90% Faradaic efficiency and 80% conversion efficiency at &#8764;0.6 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;, significantly reducing energy consumption compared to traditional one-step routes at &amp;gt;1.2 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Glucaric acid (GRA) is a critical platform chemical for manufacturing biodegradable materials. Selective glucose (GLU) electrooxidation into GRA provides a sustainable route for biomass valorization. However, conventional methods suffer from energy-intensive processes due to excessive operational potential exceeding 1.2&#160;V. Here we demonstrate an energy-efficient tandem system that decouples GRA electrosynthesis into cascade GLU-to-gluconic acid (GNA) and GNA-to-GRA oxidation. When pairing an Au/C catalyst for selective aldehyde oxidation and an AuPt/C catalyst for hydroxyl oxidation, we achieve 91.8% Faradaic efficiency and nearly 100% conversion efficiency at 0.6 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; for GLU-to-GNA oxidation, and 81% Faradaic efficiency and 90% conversion efficiency at 0.55 V&lt;sub&gt;RHE&lt;/sub&gt; for GNA-to-GRA oxidation. Chronoamperometry demonstrates &#8764;100% substrate conversion with a minor decrease in product selectivity, confirming the catalyst's excellent stability. Our tandem system improves the overall GLU-to-GRA energy efficiency from 13.8% for conventional one-step route to 31.8%. When oxygen reduction is selected as paired reaction, our system not only enables efficient chemical electrosynthesis, but is also estimated to generate electricity of 1.24 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;kWh per kiloton GRA, outperforming traditional method with energy consumption of 4.31 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;5&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;kWh. Our work establishes a sustainable and economically viable pathway for biomass valorization, offering a blueprint for circular, carbon-neutral chemical production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Density Recovery by Enhanced Hydrogen Bonding for High&#8208;Performance Composite Phase Change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofillers can improve thermal conductivity of PCM but lower its energy density. We recover the lost energy by strengthening the hydrogen bonds between the fillers and the PCM. This hydroxyl&#8208;modified method almost restores the full latent heat of polyols and also works for acids and hydrated salts, offering a universal strategy to develop composite PCM with both high energy and power density.








ABSTRACT
Phase change materials (PCMs) for thermal energy storage require both high latent heat and high thermal conductivity, which is almost infeasible because the energy&#8208;dense materials are usually poor heat conductors, and increasing their thermal conductivity by making composites inevitably leads to a sacrifice in latent heat. Here, we propose a strategy for recovering the unavoidable loss of energy density of a composite PCM by strengthening the molecular connections between the fillers and matrix PCM. Taking erythritol (a polyol rich in hydroxyl groups) as an example, we use hydroxyl&#8208;modified nanofillers to reconstruct the filler&#8208;to&#8208;PCM intermolecular hydrogen bonds. Compared to unmodified graphene, we observe a remarkable recovery in the latent heat of erythritol using hydroxylated graphene, and verify the extension of this strategy to acids and hydrated salts. We show an almost full recovery of the energy density loss for composite erythritol at 1&#160;wt.% loading, reaching an ultrahigh latent heat of fusion (328.5&#177;0.9 J g&#8722;1). Using molecular simulations, we confirm the formation of strong hydrogen bonds between the model PCM molecules and hydroxylated graphene. Our strategy enables the development of polyol&#8208;based composite PCMs, which can be generalized to other matrix PCMs, toward more balanced performance in high energy density and power density.

         <title>Eutectozymes as Soft Hybrid Materials for Advanced Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eutectozymes are sustainable hybrid materials that embed a GOx&#8211;HRP cascade within hydrophobic eutectogels featuring a dual supramolecular&#8211;covalent network. This architecture preserves native enzyme structure and stability, enables efficient heterogeneous biocatalysis in aqueous media, and positions eutectogels as robust platforms for next&#8208;generation biocatalytic and multifunctional hybrid materials.








ABSTRACT
The development of soft hybrid materials that combine structural integrity, biocompatibility, and catalytic function is a central challenge in advanced biocatalysis. Here, we introduce eutectozymes, enzyme&#8208;loaded eutectogels built from natural hydrophobic deep eutectic solvents (HES) and stabilized through a dual supramolecular polymeric network. This unique architecture not only preserves the conformational integrity of enzymes but also creates confined microcavities acting as protective microreactors, thereby enhancing their stability and substrate affinity. Eutectozymes exhibit remarkable resilience under harsh operational conditions, including high temperatures, extreme pH, and organic solvents, while maintaining high catalytic efficiency and reusability. Their versatility is further demonstrated in environmental remediation, achieving over 90% degradation of recalcitrant dyes, and in antimicrobial applications against resistant bacterial strains. By synergistically merging the stabilizing properties of HES with robust gel matrices, eutectozymes establish a transformative platform for heterogeneous biocatalysis, opening new avenues in biotechnology, bioelectronics, and environmental technologies.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Action Nucleoside&#8208;Based Supramolecular Hydrogel Combats Periodontitis by Disrupting the Bacteria&#8208;Osteoclast Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEGylated nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogel (APC) is developed to break the pathogenic feedback loop between periodontal bacteria and osteoclast (OC)&#8208;driven bone resorption. Through sequential antibacterial activity and cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;protein kinase G (cGMP&#8208;PKG) mediated OC suppression, the hydrogel restores microbial homeostasis and reduces bone loss in vivo, offering a dual&#8208;action platform for inflammation&#8208;associated bone degeneration.








ABSTRACT
Periodontitis is a highly prevalent oral inflammatory disease and a recognized risk factor for multiple systemic disorders. The major therapeutic challenge in periodontitis lies in addressing alveolar bone loss driven by the complex interplay between microbial dysbiosis, immune dysregulation, and bone homeostatic imbalance. Here, we identify a positive feedback loop between periodontal bacteria and osteoclast (OC)&#8208;mediated bone resorption, and design a novel self&#8208;drug delivery system (APC hydrogel) aiming to break this destructive cycle. This supramolecular hydrogel, constructed from PEGylated, structurally optimized nucleoside derivatives, self&#8208;assembles via multivalent hydrogen bonding and demonstrates favorable biocompatibility and metabolic stability in vivo. Functionally, the hydrogel exerts a dual&#8208;action by sequentially eradicating key periodontal pathogens and suppressing OC activity. In a ligation model of periodontitis, local application of the hydrogel restored microbial homeostasis and reduced alveolar bone loss by approximately 60%. Mechanistic investigations revealed that APC metabolites activated the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;protein kinase G (cGMP&#8208;PKG) signaling pathway in OC precursors, thereby blocking their differentiation into mature, bone&#8208;resorbing cells. This dual&#8208;action approach effectively disrupts the pathogenic cascade of microbial infection and osteoclastic bone destruction within a single platform, redefining local therapeutic strategies for periodontitis and highlighting the broader potential of nucleoside&#8208;based supramolecular systems in the treatment of inflammation&#8208;associated bone loss.

         <title>A Low&#8208;Concentration All&#8208;Phosphate Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage and High&#8208;Safety Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;concentration all&#8208;phosphate electrolyte incorporating a newly designed cyclic phosphate solvent (HTP) demonstrates wide potential window, unmeasurably high flash point, excellent nonflammability and thermal stability. This endows the stable operation of 4.5&#160;V graphite||NMC811 cells at extreme temperatures up to 100&#176;C and pass various rigorous safety tests, which is unattainable for previous electrolyte design and can be broadly applicable to other batteries.








ABSTRACT
The majority of safety incidents associated with lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) arise from the utilization of highly volatile and flammable carbonate electrolytes. The adoption of non&#8208;flammable all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent electrolytes could significantly enhance the safety of LIBs. Nevertheless, all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent electrolytes at low&#8208;concentrations (&#8776;1&#160;m) are not compatible with commercial graphite anodes. Herein, we design and synthesize a new six&#8208;membered cyclic phosphate (HTP) with intrinsic graphite passivation ability as electrolyte solvent. Conventional tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl) phosphate (FTEP) is introduced as co&#8208;solvent to regulate the electrolyte solvation structure through solvent&#8211;solvent interactions between HTP and FTEP, which facilitates Li+ de&#8208;solvation and contributes to the formation of a highly robust inorganic&#8208;polymeric CEI/SEI. The resulting low&#8208;concentration electrolyte with all&#8208;phosphate&#8208;solvent not only exhibits wide potential window, unmeasurably high flash point, excellent non&#8208;flammability and thermal stability, but also promises the 4.5&#160;V graphite||LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 full&#8208;cells to operate stably at extreme temperatures up to 100&#176;C and pass various rigorous safety tests. This work provides new insights into the design of non&#8208;flammable electrolytes for high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;safety LIBs and are broadly applicable to other batteries.

         <title>Bridging Acidic and Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis via Ru&#8208;Modified Pt3Co for Waste&#8208;to&#8208;Energy Electrochemical Neutralization Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a Ru&#8208;modulated ordered P3Co intermetallic electrocatalyst with exceptional cross&#8208;environment hydrogen shuttling capability. Through Ru coordination, the electronic structure of Co is tuned to enhance the hydroxyl binding energy, thereby reconstructing the interfacial hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and water dynamics, which significantly improved the activity of both the alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction and the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction.








ABSTRACT
The hydrogen oxidation (HOR) and hydrogen evolution (HER) reactions define the core of hydrogen electrochemistry, yet demand distinct control over hydroxyl binding and interfacial water structuring. Here, we engineer a ruthenium single&#8208;atom anchored Pt3Co intermetallic on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (O&#8208;Pt3Co&#8208;RuNC) to bridge this divide. The catalyst delivers a mass activity 4.1 times higher than Pt/C for alkaline HOR with only 9.3% CO&#8208;induced loss, while simultaneously exhibiting remarkable activity for acidic HER, thus establishing a rare cross&#8208;environment bifunctional platform. Leveraging this property, we design an electrochemical neutralization energy fuel cell (ENFC) that converts acid&#8212;base neutralization energy directly into electricity. Using O&#8208;Pt3Co&#8208;RuNC as both anode and cathode catalyst, the ENFC achieves a peak power density of 75.0&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stable operation beyond 400&#160;h while simultaneously neutralizing waste acid and alkali. Operando spectroscopy and theoretical analyses reveal that Ru atoms electronically reprogram adjacent Co sites, strengthening hydrogen bonding in interfacial water and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer. This study offers a blueprint for constructing hydrogen electrocatalysts and hybrid fuel cells that harmonize activity, durability, and sustainable resource utilization.

         <title>Tailored Biodegradable Copolymers With Random&#8208;Block Architecture for High&#8208;Performance Absorbable Tissue Ligation Clips</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A random&#8208;block copolymer (PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA) is innovatively designed for absorbable tissue ligation clips. This tailored molecular architecture combines the flexibility of random PLCL copolymer and the high strength of PLLA homopolymer, providing good rebound ability and strong closure force, along with controlled degradability and biocompatibility. The copolymer highlights a structural innovation that advances next&#8208;generation absorbable tissue ligation clips.








ABSTRACT
To address the balance between mechanical strength and flexibility in absorbable tissue ligation clips, a novel copolymer poly(L&#8208;lactide&#8208;r&#8208;&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;b&#8208;poly(L&#8208;lactide) (PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA) with random&#8208;block molecular architecture is developed by integrating the flexibility of PLCL random copolymer and the high strength of PLLA homopolymer. Three random&#8208;block copolymers with different LLA/CL ratios are designed and synthesized. Among them, the copolymer with an LLA/CL ratio of 75:25 (PLC75&#8208;RB) exhibits the most balanced overall performance. The PLC75&#8208;RB copolymer is injected into Hem&#8208;o&#8208;lok&#8211;shaped clips (CLIP75&#8208;RB), and the CLIP75&#8208;RB possesses sufficient closure force and favorable rebound ability, meeting the requirements for tissue ligation. The degradation evaluation indicates that the CLIP75&#8208;RB maintains effective closure force for up to 4 weeks and then begins to degrade gradually. Further validation in a rabbit unilateral nephrectomy model confirms that CLIP75&#8208;RB effectively performs ligation function and subsequently undergoes controlled degradation. The histological analysis demonstrates the good biocompatibility of the clips. The random&#8208;block PLCL&#8208;b&#8208;PLLA copolymers expand the range of biodegradable polymers, and the PLC75&#8208;RB exhibits well&#8208;matched mechanical performance and degradation behavior, highlighting the potential for the next generation of absorbable tissue ligation clips.

         <title>Medium&#8208;Entropy Regulation Enables Phase&#8208;Stable Layered Oxide Cathodes with Reversible Anionic Redox for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The moderate configurational entropy in the medium&#8208;entropy cathode not only induces randomized TM distribution within TMO2 slabs but also facilitates the appropriate facet exposure to sustain sufficient Na+ retention in NaO2 layers, which synergistically alleviates the local lattice strain and delays the P&#8208;to&#8208;O phase transition by modulating interatomic interactions and maintaining robust interlayer Na+ shielding.








ABSTRACT
Layered transition&#8208;metal (TM) oxides with anionic redox reactions are promising cathode candidates for sodium&#8208;ion batteries because of their high theoretical capacity and cost effectiveness, but they still suffer from severe P&#8208;to&#8208;O phase transition, irreversible TM migration, and lattice oxygen release. Herein, we report a strategy of rational entropy regulation for circumventing these multiple issues by systematically investigating layered TM oxide cathodes with low&#8208;, medium&#8208;, and high&#8208;entropy configurations. It reveals that compared with the counterparts, the medium&#8208;entropy cathode not only mitigates the lattice strain by accommodating the changes of local interactions conferred by entropy&#8208;driven stabilization within the TMO2 slabs, but also facilitates the appropriate facet exposure to maintain sufficient interlayer Na+ shielding within the single NaO2 slab, together delaying the P&#8208;to&#8208;O phase transition onset and suppressing the neighboring O&#8208;type stacking. Therefore, this moderate medium&#8208;entropy configuration enables reversible dynamic TM migration, benefiting from the robust phase stability, as revealed by in situ high&#8208;energy&#8208;resolution fluorescence&#8208;detected X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy results, which further minimizes oxygen vacancy formation and inhibits irreversible oxygen release. As a result, enhanced electrochemical performances with a long&#8208;enduring reversible anionic redox activity are achieved. Our work underscores the critical role of rational entropy regulation for achieving high&#8208;performance layered TM oxide cathodes.

         <title>Effective Ionic Potential Guided Dual&#8208;Gradient Structural Engineering for Spent LiCoO2 Upcycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upcycling spent LiCoO2 into high&#8208;voltage cathodes presents a sustainable recycling solution. Using effective ionic potential as a guide, we successfully engineered dual&#8208;gradient structure in upcycled LiCoO2. Mechanistic insights not only reveal how inherent defects are leveraged to engineer the stable structure, but also further elucidate the relationship between this structure and the superior electrochemical stability of upcycled LiCoO2.








ABSTRACT
Sustainable recycling of degraded LiCoO2 (LCO) cathode is critical for minimizing the environmental footprint of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, we propose an upcycling method that converts degraded LCO into high&#8208;voltage cathodes by constructing a compositional and structural dual&#8208;gradient structure, guided by the effective ionic potential (EIP, &#934;*), a descriptor for foreign dopant diffusivity in degraded LCO lattices. Specifically, low&#8208;&#934;* dopants tend to exhibit high bulk diffusivity, whereas high&#8208;&#934;* dopants are retained near the surface, which promotes the formation of the compositional gradient and leads to a structural transition in LCO from a fully disordered, dense surface to an ordered layered structure in the bulk. This structure endows the upcycled cathode with a stabilized surface and low&#8208;strain bulk structure, enabling its superior electrochemical performance over the commercial counterpart at cut&#8208;off potentials of 4.6 and 4.65 V. Comprehensive kinetic and thermodynamic analyses reveal the critical role of vacancies in spent LCO for this structural engineering: Bulk vacancies facilitate the formation of deeper dopant concentration gradients within particles, while vacancies near the surface promote the development of a continuous and dense surface disordered structure. Multiscale characterizations and theoretical calculations elucidate the relationship between the engineered structure and the electrochemical stability of the upcycled cathode.

         <title>Halogenated Chiral Spacer Integration in Silver Bismuth Double Perovskites for Efficient and Selective CPL Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In silver&#8211;bismuth double perovskites exhibiting in&#8208;plane elongation of AgI6 octahedra induced by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, we demonstrate that bulk brominated chiral cations promote efficient organic&#8208;to&#8208;inorganic chirality transfer through pronounced steric interactions. This enhanced transfer results in a threefold increase in circular dichroism and enables a CPL photodetector distinguishability of 0.32, the highest value reported to date among 2D chiral double perovskite systems.








ABSTRACT
Chiral double perovskites (DPs) have emerged as a versatile class of materials for detecting circularly polarized light (CPL), offering sustainable alternatives to toxic Pb&#8208;based systems. Despite their superior oxidative stability, the interplay between A&#8208;site chiral cations and B&#8208;site metal cations in DPs remains poorly understood, particularly regarding its influence on the electronic structure and chiroptical activity. In this study, we propose a rational chiral cation design strategy in which halogen substitution facilitates cooperative coupling with bond elongation induced by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in the inorganic layer, thereby revealing an enhanced chirality transfer phenomenon across the hybrid framework.

&lt;p&gt;In silver&#8211;bismuth double perovskites exhibiting in-plane elongation of AgI&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; octahedra induced by the Jahn&#8211;Teller effect, we demonstrate that bulk brominated chiral cations promote efficient organic-to-inorganic chirality transfer through pronounced steric interactions. This enhanced transfer results in a threefold increase in circular dichroism and enables a CPL photodetector distinguishability of 0.32, the highest value reported to date among 2D chiral double perovskite systems.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chiral double perovskites (DPs) have emerged as a versatile class of materials for detecting circularly polarized light (CPL), offering sustainable alternatives to toxic Pb-based systems. Despite their superior oxidative stability, the interplay between A-site chiral cations and B-site metal cations in DPs remains poorly understood, particularly regarding its influence on the electronic structure and chiroptical activity. In this study, we propose a rational chiral cation design strategy in which halogen substitution facilitates cooperative coupling with bond elongation induced by Jahn&#8211;Teller distortion in the inorganic layer, thereby revealing an enhanced chirality transfer phenomenon across the hybrid framework. Moreover, halogen&#183;&#183;&#183;halogen interactions contribute to increased lattice rigidity in the 2D DPs, enhancing phase stability in thin-film configurations. As a result, a CPL photodetector based on Br-substituted chiral DPs achieves a CPL distinguishability of 0.32, the highest reported value among 2D chiral DP-based devices, alongside high photodetection performance and extended operational stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Twist&#8208;Induced All&#8208;Flat&#8208;Band Higher&#8208;Order Acoustic Topological Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by introducing periodic strong localized resonances into the superlattices, a novel acoustic flat&#8208;band higher&#8208;order topological insulator is proposed based on the standing&#8208;wave effect of multipolar Mie resonances, varied frequency edge states and high&#8208;Q corner states are observed in the topological twist array with all&#8208;flat band owing to the operational simplicity of acoustic TMS, it can be readily stacked into a 3D configuration, yielding out&#8208;of&#8208;phase topological hinge states.








ABSTRACT
Twisted Moir&#233; superlattices (TMSs) exhibit unique geometric periodicity and interlayer Bragg scattering effects, which have been widely exploited for flat&#8208;band engineering. However, to date, no report has directly addressed the mechanism of achieving all&#8208;flat&#8208;band topology with the intrinsic eigenmodes of Moir&#233; periodicity. In this work, by introducing periodic strong localized resonances into the superlattices, a novel acoustic flat&#8208;band higher&#8208;order topological insulator is proposed. Based on the standing&#8208;wave effect of multipolar Mie resonances, varied&#8208;frequency edge states and high&#8208;quality (high&#8208;Q) corner states are observed in the topological all&#8208;flat&#8208;bandgaps. More interestingly, owing to the operational simplicity of acoustic TMS, it can be readily stacked into a 3D configuration, yielding out&#8208;of&#8208;phase topological hinge states. This study unveils a simple strategy to construct acoustic all&#8208;flat&#8208;band topological insulators, providing new potential for applications such as energy harvesting and sensing.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Driven Ionic Trap Construction and Interface Modulation for Rapid Li+ Kinetics in Composite Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;engineered carbon nitride nanosheets introduce shallow ionic trap into composite solid electrolytes, enabling reversible Li+ capture/release and selective conduction over bulky anions. This shallow ionic trap regulation balances transport and stability, guiding uniform interfacial growth and establishing a new paradigm for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








ABSTRACT
Composite solid electrolytes (CSEs) hold great promise for lithium metal batteries owing to the inherent safety and mechanical flexibility, yet their progress is impeded by sluggish Li+ transport and unstable interfacial chemistry. Herein, we unveil an ionic&#8208;trap framework to clarify the essential role of inorganic fillers in regulating ion migration. Specifically, milled carbon nitride with oxamide incorporation (MCNOI) introduces abundant nitrogen vacancies that function as a shallow ionic trap, enabling reversible Li+ capture/release and constructing continuous conduction pathways. By contrast, traditional carbon nitride forms a deep ionic trap that immobilizes Li+, whereas ionic trap&#8208;free polymer electrolytes lack effective guidance for Li+ transport. Beyond intrinsic ion conduction, MCNOI facilitates the formation of a gradient organic&#8208;inorganic interphase, redistributing interfacial charges, suppressing anion migration, and promoting uniform Li deposition. Consequently, the optimized CSE achieves a high Li+ transference number (0.68), ultralong cycling stability (&gt;3000&#160;h), and remarkable full&#8208;cell durability (92.3% capacity retention after 1800 cycles at 5 C). These findings highlight defect&#8208;engineered fillers as active regulators of Li+ transport, redefining design strategies for durable high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Engineering Free Volume within Frontal Ring&#8208;Opening Metathesis Polymerization via Pendant Plasticization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Norbornene&#8208;based copolymers with tunable n&#8208;alkyl pendant length provide control over matrix free volume, enabling elastomeric materials via frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP).








ABSTRACT
Frontal ring&#8208;opening metathesis polymerization (FROMP) enables rapid, energy&#8208;efficient access to high&#8208;performance thermosets and thermoplastics, but the range of accessible properties remains constrained by the rigidity of norbornene&#8208;type backbones. Here we introduce a side&#8208;chain plasticization strategy for FROMP, wherein norbornene esters bearing n&#8208;alkyl groups of varying length (n = 8, 12, 16) are copolymerized with dicyclopentadiene (DCPD) or hydrogenated DCPD (DCPD&#8208;H2). Systematic incorporation of these pendants tunes free volume, resulting in predictable reductions in glass transition temperature (Tg), decreased moduli, and a transition from rigid&#160;thermosets to elastomers&#160;exceeding 800% elongation at break. Free&#8208;volume analysis via dynamic mechanical analysis and solvent swelling ratios confirms pendant length and distribution as key parameters governing network porosity and mobility. Moreover, high&#8208;alkyl&#8208;content formulations exhibit nonlinear front propagation (spin modes) and strain&#8208;induced whitening&#8212;features that highlight opportunities for spatial patterning and cooperative molecular alignment under load. Collectively, these results establish side&#8208;chain engineering as a versatile design principle for expanding FROMP into elastomeric regimes, providing a scalable pathway to soft, tunable, and structurally programmable materials.

         <title>C16 Phase High Entropy Borides With High Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare&#8208;earth&#8208;free C16&#8208;phase high entropy boride thin films exhibit enhanced magnetic anisotropy with coercivities surpassing their binary and ternary counterparts. Combinatorial synthesis of (Fe&#8208;Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mn)2B films combined with density functional theory enables mapping of the magnetic properties across the composition space, revealing high entropy compositions with high magnetic anisotropy mediated by an optimized electronic structure.








ABSTRACT
High magnetic anisotropy materials have critical applications in numerous technology sectors, largely relying on rare&#8208;earth and precious metals which poses major sustainability challenges. The high entropy composition space offers a vast arena for exploration of high magnetic anisotropy materials based on earth&#8208;abundant elements. However, common high entropy alloys favor disordered cubic crystal structures whereas ordered uniaxial structures are necessary for the desirable strong magnetic anisotropy. Here we report the discovery of novel quinary borides with C16 uniaxial crystal structure and high magnetic anisotropy. Switching the easy&#8208;plane anisotropy of binary C16 borides to easy&#8208;axis can be achieved through a suitable mixing of Fe and Co on the transition metal sublattice. Using a combinatorial sputtering approach, we explore the wider high entropy composition space to further enhance the anisotropy of the C16 phase by incorporation of additional magnetic 3d transition metals. Significant coercivity increase, more than two&#8208;fold, has been observed, compared with binary and ternary transition metal borides. Density functional theory calculations support the experimental findings, predicting anisotropy approaching 107&#160;erg/cm3, which is understood in terms of the optimized electronic structure of the high entropy borides. These results establish a promising boron&#8208;assisted synthesis strategy to achieve strong magnetic anisotropy using earth&#8208;abundant elements.

         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector utilizing ferroelectric Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 ceramic, which exhibits a high sensitivity of 1196.82&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 7.31&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1. It maintains a record sensitivity of 544.69&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 125&#176;C, with successful imaging demonstration. This study opens a new avenue for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection using ferroelectric ceramics.








ABSTRACT
Advancing X&#8208;ray detection technology hinges on creating next&#8208;generation direct&#8208;detection semiconductors that unite high sensitivity, exceptional stability, and self&#8208;powered functionality. Here, Pb(Zr0.52Ti0.48)O3 (PZT) ceramic is developed as a novel self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection material due to its huge internal electrostatic field. Under 70&#160;keV X&#8208;ray radiation, the PZT ceramic detector shows a high sensitivity of 1196.82&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 at room temperature, which is about 60 times larger than commercial &#945;&#8208;Se. Meanwhile, the minimum detectable limit reaches 7.31&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 under 40&#160;keV X&#8208;ray. Interestingly, the self&#8208;powered PZT ceramic detection properties can be regulated by temperature. At 125&#176;C, the PZT detector exhibits a record self&#8208;powered sensitivity of 544.69&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and an ultralow detection limit of 10.71&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 under 70&#160;keV X&#8208;ray radiation. Moreover, the imaging capability of the self&#8208;powered PZT ceramic detector is successfully demonstrated at 125&#176;C. This first demonstration of heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;containing ferroelectric ceramics as excellent self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detection materials marks a breakthrough, revealing their potential for future high&#8208;temperature applications and significantly advancing the use of ferroelectrics in this field.

         <title>Structural Exploration of Zirconium Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Through Linker Desymmetrization and Modulator Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A linker&#8208;desymmetrization&#8208;modulator&#8208;compensation (LDMC) strategy for constructing structurally diverse Zr&#8208;MOFs is reported.&#160;This approach reduces linker symmetry to create defects in Zr&#8208;clusters, which can be compensated for by modulator coordination. Using this approach, we synthesized PCN&#8208;1005 and PCN&#8208;1006, featuring unprecedented Zr&#8208;clusters. In PCN&#8208;1006, a pentacarboxylate linker enables the formation of a dual&#8208;node network, delivering exceptional CH4/CO2 adsorption and H2 selectivity.








ABSTRACT
Zirconium&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Zr&#8208;MOFs) feature exceptional thermal/chemical stability among various MOFs, enabling diverse applications. Their material properties are highly dependent on molecular structures consisting of Zr&#8208;clusters and organic linkers. However, structural diversity in Zr&#8208;MOFs remains constrained by the limited variety of known Zr&#8208;clusters and the predominance of high&#8208;symmetry linkers, which stems from the inherent symmetry constraints presented by Zr&#8208;clusters. In this work, we develop a linker&#8208;desymmetrization&#8208;modulator&#8208;compensation (LDMC) strategy to construct Zr&#8208;MOFs with enhanced structural diversity. This approach reduces linker symmetry to create structural defects in Zr&#8208;clusters, while such a thermodynamically unfavorable process can be compensated for by the coordination of modulators, such as benzoic acid and formic acid. As a result, two MOFs, PCN&#8208;1005 and PCN&#8208;1006, with unprecedented Zr&#8208;clusters have been constructed. PCN&#8208;1005 features an asymmetric Zr6 cluster stabilized by mono&#8208; and capping benzoates. In PCN&#8208;1006, a rare pentacarboxylate linker enables the formation of a dual&#8208;node network comprised of both Zr6 and Zr6&#8208;f&#8208;Zr6 clusters, resulting in one&#8208;dimensional channels with exceptional adsorption performance for methane and carbon dioxide, affording high selectivity over hydrogen. These findings underscore the advancement of the LDMC strategy in promoting the structural complexity and functionality of Zr&#8208;MOFs, providing a versatile platform for energy and environmental applications.

ABSTRACT
Solar steam generation is an eco&#8208;friendly desalination method, but salt crystallization within the evaporator workspace decreases system efficiency and lifespan. We report an enabling dynamic 3D windmill evaporator that achieves continuous water desalination, localized point salt crystallization and harvesting. By adjusting the structure of the windmill evaporator and the position of the water transport point, the salt solution transport and backflow pathway can be controlled to produce different salt crystallization behaviors. Salt crystallization localized solely at the evaporator blade edge apex, spatially isolated from the water evaporation surface, ensuring steady steam generation and salt collection. The system maintained high evaporation rates of 2.25&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and salt collection rates of 41.2&#160;g m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 over 420 h at 20 wt.% NaCl solution. Furthermore, the windmill evaporator combined with microgenerators can convert wind energy into electricity, one 3D dynamic system can generate peak voltage of 12&#160;V and evaporation rate of 12.9&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 in outdoor testing. Finally, this study demonstrated an integrated &#8220;desalination&#8208;wind electricity&#8208;irrigation&#8221; system that utilized solar, terrestrial, and wind energy, which brings new hope for future energy conservation and sustainable development.

         <title>An Inter&#8208;Locking Quasi&#8208;Solid Cathode for Zinc&#8208;Bromine Batteries with Stable 32000 Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The inter&#8208;locking quasi&#8208;soild cathode encapsulates the tribromide molecules within the charged bromine cathode, suppressing bromine dissolution and mitigating self&#8208;discharge. Meanwhile, the flexibility of PAM accommodates volume changes, ensuring stability of the conductive skeleton. Thus, the constructed Zn&#8208;Br2 battery exhibits an exceptional cyclability of &#8776;32000 cycles.









Abstract
Zinc&#8208;bromine static batteries employing solid bromine cathodes present compelling advantages of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and extended&#8208;lifespan for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. However, solid&#8208;state bromine cathodes suffer from polybromide&#8208;induced shuttle effects and substantial volume variations, leading to poor reversibility and severe self&#8208;discharge. Herein, an inter&#8208;locking, quasi&#8208;solid bromine cathode enabling energetic static zinc&#8208;bromine batteries are developed. Theoretical calculation and characterizations confirm that polyacrylamide (PAM) effectively encapsulates tribromide molecules within the charged bromine cathode, suppressing bromine dissolution and mitigating self&#8208;discharge. Meanwhile, its flexibility accommodates volume changes and maintains conductive integrity. The resultant zinc&#8208;bromine battery achieves &#8776;32000 cycles at 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralow decay rate of 0.00016% per cycle. Meanwhile, it delivers scalable areal capacity up to 50 mAh cm&#8722;2. Pouch cell with 200 mAh demonstrates remarkable stability of 3500 cycles, while displays capacity retention of &#8776;93% after 48&#160;h resting. The 1.5 Ah pouch cell delivers a practical energy density of 70&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 based on the total mass of pouch cell, while its modular integration (&#8776;18&#160;Wh) enables storage of hybrid energy harvesting from solar and wind sources, demonstrating versatile applicability in multi&#8208;scenario energy systems. This strategy establishes a viable pathway for developing practical zinc&#8208;bromine batteries toward grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>In Situ Dual&#8208;Interface Modulation for Homogeneous Sn&#9472;Pb Perovskites and Efficient Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tailored in situ dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy is developed, capitalizing on the TTF&#8208;related multiple interactions and self&#8208;assembled interfacial enrichment distribution. This approach effectively regulates the crystallization dynamics, balances Sn ion distribution, promotes the carrier extraction and transfer across both the perovskite bulk and the dual interfaces, as well as stabilizes the perovskite structure, achieving high&#8208;performance Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite TSCs.








ABSTRACT
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) show great promise as the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology with high theoretical efficiency and low fabrication cost. However, further progress in the TSCs is critically hampered by the subpar performance of mixed tin&#8208;lead narrow&#8208;bandgap bottom subcells, which arises from the uncontrolled crystallization, unbalanced Sn2+ oxidation, and undesirable band alignment. Here, we develop an in situ dual&#8208;interface modulation strategy for tin&#8208;lead (Sn&#9472;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) by incorporating planar rigid tetrathiafulvalene (TTF) into the precursor solution. The interactions between electron donor TTF and Sn&#9472;Pb perovskite precursor constituents, coupled with the in situ self&#8208;assembled dual&#8208;interface enrichment of TTF, collectively regulate the crystallization dynamics, homogenize the Sn oxidation states, facilitate the carrier extraction and transport in the perovskite bulk and dual interfaces, and stabilize the perovskite structure. Such improvements enable homogeneous single&#8208;junction Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs to achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.30%, together with a record&#8208;high fill factor of 83.59% and excellent stability. Furthermore, we obtained a high PCE of 29.14% (certified 29.07%) in all&#8208;perovskite TSCs. Encapsulated tandem retains 80% of its initial efficiency following 964&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination in ambient air.

         <title>A Universal Polyelectrolyte&#8208;Locking Strategy: From Common Proteins to Stable Unfolded Protein&#8208;Based Adhesives for Rapid and Robust Tissue Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable and robust unfolded protein&#8208;based adhesives utilize polyelectrolyte&#8208;mediated entanglement&#8208;locking strategy, which stabilizes hydrophobic residue exposure for fluid resistance and interfacial adhesion, and reinforces cohesion properties through chain entanglement with unfolded protein networks. In severe hemorrhage models, the adhesives achieve excellent hemostatic performance, in terms of significantly reduced blood loss compared to commercial fibrin glue.








ABSTRACT
Marine protein adhesives present robust wet adhesion by mediating interfacial interactions through surface&#8208;exposed hydrophobic domains/adhesive groups and maintaining cohesive networks via intrinsically disordered protein structures. Replicating these capabilities in common protein systems remains challenging, especially in stabilizing hydrophobic residues at interface and improving cohesive properties. Here, we developed unfolded protein&#8208;based adhesives via a universal strategy of locking with polyelectrolytes that have flexible long chains and high charge density. These polyelectrolytes simultaneously stabilize exposed hydrophobic residues on the unfolded proteins and reinforce cohesion properties via chain entanglement with electrostatic/hydrogen bonding interactions. The unfolded bovine serum albumin (UBSA) and polyacrylic acid (PAA) are integrated to prepare a representative tissue adhesive (UBSA&#8208;PAA), exemplifying the polyelectrolyte&#8208;locking strategy. The UBSA&#8208;PAA adhesive demonstrated interfacial hydrophobicity (water contact angles &gt;90&#176;) and excellent adhesion performance on wet tissue. In severe liver and femoral artery hemorrhage models, this adhesive significantly reduced blood loss compared to commercial fibrin glue, while maintaining comparable biocompatibility. This polyelectrolyte&#8208;locking molecular engineering strategy provides a universal framework for designing protein&#8208;based adhesives with excellent wet adhesion performance.

Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composites
An enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The composites exhibit high mechanical performance surpassing the natural tooth enamel, which is fundamentally accounted for the interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic. More details can be found in the Research Article by Junfeng Lu, Tianqi Guo, Hewei Zhao, Lin Guo, and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202503537).

         <dc:description>
The nature&#8208;inspired fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy, which enables controllable liquid transfer, has demonstrated advantages in making various desired micro&#8208;patterns with cm&#8208;scale uniformity, &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation. This review systematically summarizes the research progress in making micro&#8208;patterns using a fibrous&#8208;guided strategy, including both the fundamentals of liquid manipulation and applications in optoelectronics, as well as the remaining challenges.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning is a crucial process for making high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, since the carrier transfer behavior is closely related to the uniformity, orientation, and resolution of micro&#8208;patterns. Developing solution processes with good controllability has thus attracted increasing research interest in the last decade. Inspired by Chinese brushes, a fibrous&#8208;guided direct&#8208;writing strategy is recently developed that enables controllable liquid transfer for making micro&#8208;patterns, which is systematically reviewed from viewpoints of both the fundamentals in liquid manipulation and the applications in optoelectronics. First, a model structure of dual&#8208;conical fibers (CFs) is proposed, whose capacity in liquid transfer is featured as the dynamic liquid balance and the uniform liquid film. On the basis, triple&#8208; and multi&#8208; CFs are developed for transferring liquid onto the target substrate in a controllable manner, where the tri&#8208;phase contact line can be finely tuned. Thereafter, micro&#8208;patterns with &#181;m&#8208;scale resolution, cm&#8208;scale uniformity, and molecular&#8208;scale orientation can be achieved, as is demonstrated by the as&#8208;prepared ultrasmooth quantum dot films, highly aligned silver nanowires films, and wrinkle&#8208;free reduced graphene oxide films, respectively. The high&#8208;performance optoelectronic devices, including quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes, flexible transparent electrodes, and pressure sensors, are demonstrated. Perspectives for solution&#8208;processed micro&#8208;patterning in optoelectronics are also suggested.

Life engineering of materials: Constructing life plugins based on artificial materials, and achieving non&#8208;natural transformation and evolution of biological systems through the mutual integration and interaction between materials and life processes. Transform nonliving materials into components of life, breaking the boundaries between traditional material science and life science.








Abstract
Biomineralization is nature's precision engineering system, creating functional biomaterials with exceptional performance through orchestrated organic&#8211;inorganic synergistic interactions. Beyond fundamental investigations into biomineralization processes and mechanisms, research has evolved from structural biomimetics toward creating interdependent material&#8211;organism hybrids through mineralization&#8208;inspired design. Breakthroughs in technologies such as inorganic ion polymerization have significantly advanced strategies for fusing artificial materials with hard tissue regeneration (teeth/bones). Through material&#8211;biological integration strategies such as extracellular assembly, artificial organelle transplantation, and artificial functional tissue construction, the creation of artificial life plugins with enhanced nongenetic biological functions (not directly encoded by the DNA) has been achieved. A key pathway to achieving mineralization&#8208;inspired design lies in the development of a material&#8208;engineered bio&#8208;plugin, the material unit with interfaces characterized by chemically tailored compatibility and programmable bio&#8208;interactions. Materials that can serve as bio&#8208;plugins confer organisms with emergent functionalities such as cell protection, vaccine enhancement, and disease treatment. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in artificial material&#8211;biological fusion technologies, highlights their critical role in the life engineering of materials, and envisions their potential to catalyze new paradigms in biomedical applications.

         <title>Elastic Energy Storage in Biological Materials: Internal Stresses and Their Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing and storing internally generated elastic energy is a clever strategy by biological materials to perform functions like shape transformation, movement, and predation. This review explores how biological systems manipulate mechanisms like atomic or protein integration into minerals, protein conformational shifts, phase transitions, and osmotic pressure to store and utilize elastic energy&#8212;functioning as &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; to drive biological processes.








Abstract
In the biological world, materials are often heterogeneous and anisotropic, comprising components with very different elastic properties. The resulting structures are exposed to force generation by chemo&#8208;mechanical energy conversion&#8212;such as water absorption, phase separation, or crystallization. Such phenomena may result in strain misfits that generate internal stresses that store elastic energies, which turn out to be extremely useful for enabling functions such as shape change, locomotion, or predation. However, the significance of elastic energy storage has received little attention. In this review, by considering examples of a broad spectrum of biological materials spanning shape&#8208;morphing plant seed pods, smart appendages of crustaceans, ballistic tongues, and damage&#8208;tolerant mineralized tissues, the fundamental aspects involved in the generation, storage, and release of internally generated elastic energies are surveyed. These have major implications for functions such as strengthening and toughening, shape morphing and actuation, ballistic movements, tensegrity, and bending stabilization. How Phenomena such as atomic or protein incorporation into minerals, conformational changes of proteins, phase transformation, and osmotic pressure are manipulated in the biological world to generate function by storing elastic energy are described. Such &#8220;elastic energy batteries&#8221; provide efficient performance and evolutionarily adapted functionality through a smart, structure&#8208;based energy management.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Liquid Crystal Polymer Actuators: From Alignment Regulation to Nano&#8208;composition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators appears as a bridge between artificial systems and the natural biological intelligence. Here, an overview of the development and cutting&#8208;edge advancements is provided in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators, focusing on how alignment regulation and nano&#8208;composition influence their actuation modes and performance. Furthermore, an outlook is proposed for the LCP actuators closer to actual biological muscles and their potential in soft robotics.








Abstract
Liquid crystal polymers (LCPs) that possess crosslinked networks and ordered alignment of mesogens are renowned for their large and reversible anisotropic deformation in response to external stimuli, which holds great potential in the burgeoning field of nature&#8208;inspired actuators and robots. Continuous efforts have been made in revealing the interplay between materials chemistry, processing, and alignment of LCPs, to broaden the actuation modes and enhance the actuation performance toward practical utilization. In this review, the advances in nature&#8208;inspired LCP actuators is focused with special attentions devoted in their mesogen alignment and the macroscopic geometry. Since the mesogen alignment is vital for the attainable actuation modes, the methods for alignment regulating are detailly combed, including surface&#8208;enforced alignment, field&#8208;assisted alignment, mechanical alignment, rheological alignment, and self&#8208;assembly. Subsequently, the composition of nanomaterials is futher surveyed in LCP actuators with a focus on enhancing the actuation performance. Finally, perspectives on the current challenges and potential development trends are discussed, which may shed light on future investigations.

         <title>Advances in Nature&#8208;Inspired Particles for Bioanalytical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Learning from unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes, researchers have developed plentiful particle materials for diverse bioanalytical applications. In this review, a comprehensive summary of the advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles, encompassing design principles, preparation methods, and bioanalytical applications is presented. It also critically evaluates the unresolved challenges hindering practical implementations in bioanalysis and proposes some promising research directions.








Abstract
Nature has evolved sophisticated prototypes to achieve functions from efficient separation to selective capture, targeted interaction, and interactive communication. These biological blueprints provide transformative inspiration for engineering advanced particle materials tailored for bioanalytical challenges. This review comprehensively examines recent advances in nature&#8208;inspired particles from natural prototypes to preparation methods and various bioanalytical applications. The design principle of nature&#8208;inspired particles originates from the unique chemical and topological characteristics of natural prototypes including biomolecules (proteins and nucleic acids), subcellular particles (virus, extracellular vesicles (EVs), bacteria, and platelet), cells (erythrocyte, sperm cell, immune cell, and pollen), creatures (urchin and hedgehog), and minerals (zeolites). Various preparation methods have been developed to replicate the intricate features of these prototypes. These nature&#8208;inspired particles have demonstrated effectiveness in bioanalytical applications, such as i) adsorption, separation, and removal of biological molecules, ii) interaction, recognition, and capture of biological particles, iii) biological sensing, and iv) biological imaging. Some existing challenges and potential research opportunities have also been indicated in bioanalytical practice. It is anticipated that more nature&#8208;inspired particles would be created with programmable chemistry and topology, exhibiting integrated functions, and benefiting various practical bioanalytical applications with the assistance of artificial intelligence (AI) and big data processing.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Multidisciplinary Strategies for Tissue and Organ Cryopreservation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rooted in evolutionary adaptations observed in freeze&#8208;resistant organisms, these bioinspired strategies converge to form a cross&#8208;disciplinary synergy&#8212;harnessing principles from physics, molecular biophysics, supramolecular chemistry, and biomimetic materials science&#8212;to engineer tailored cryopreservation protocols for architecturally diverse biosystems such as tissues and organs. By emulating nature's antifreeze mechanisms, desiccation tolerance, and cold&#8208;adaptive cellular signaling, this paradigm shift addresses the unique thermodynamic and structural challenges of complex biological specimens.








Abstract
Cryopreservation of organs and tissues represents a significant advancement in biomedicine, integrating fields such as cell biology, tissue engineering, and organ transplantation. However, this technique faces substantial challenges, primarily due to ice&#8208;related damage and biological stress responses. This review first highlights these critical obstacles and then examines the sophisticated strategies that various organisms have evolved to survive extreme cold. Key mechanisms include complex biological stress responses (involving cold signal perception, metabolic reconfiguration) and physical ice&#8208;control strategies, such as deep eutectic solvents (DESs), adsorption&#8208;inhibition by ice&#8208;binding proteins (IBPs), and the crowding assemblies such as coacervates and hydrogels. Inspired by these biological principles, the review discusses significant advances in cryoprotection technology: 1) Innovative cold&#8208;adaptation biology applied to organ preservation; 2) Advanced techniques to develop artificial ice&#8208;controlling molecules and materials; 3) Advanced rewarming strategies utilizing nanoparticles. Despite this promising progress, key challenges in translating these laboratory innovations into clinical practice are discussed. Finally, we propose an ideal &#8220;cocktail&#8208;style&#8221; cryoprotectant combining vascular&#8208;targeted nanoparticles for ice control, extracellular matrix&#8208;stabilizing polymers, cell&#8208;specific ice regulators, and metabolic modulators, potentially transforming transplant medicine through global organ banking and advancing regenerative therapies.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design Strategies for Efficient Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents advances in bioinspired atmospheric water harvesting systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity have been translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption strategies for enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. It outlines the design principles that bridge biological inspiration with practical, scalable solutions to address the global water challenges.








Abstract
The accelerating global scarcity of freshwater, driven by rapid economic growth, environmental degradation, and climate change, has heightened the urgency for the development of advanced atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) strategies. Earth's atmosphere contains an enormous reservoir of &#8776;13 trillion tons of water, exceeding the volume of all accessible surface freshwater, yet it remains vastly underutilized. Effectively utilizing the atmospheric water requires efficient capture and release strategies that can function under diverse climatic conditions. Through millions of years, organisms in both arid and humid environments have evolved specialized structures or surfaces to capture water directly from the atmosphere. This review highlights recent advances in bioinspired AWH systems, emphasizing how structural motifs such as wettability gradients, directional transport, and hierarchical porosity are translated into engineered fog&#8208;collection and vapor&#8208;sorption systems, leading to enhanced water uptake, accelerated transport, and energy&#8208;efficient release. By integrating insights from various complementary approaches, the design principles and fabrication strategies that bridge biological inspiration with practical, high&#8208;efficiency AWH for scalable solutions to address the global water challenges are outlined.

Mechanical information recognition technology, which integrates information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing&#160;and processing, promises to enable applications in intelligent robotics, healthcare, and virtual reality. The mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired to develop mechanical information bionic recognition technology to address the challenges of information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. In this work, bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing, acquisition, and processing are summarized systematically. The potential applications, future challenges, and opportunities of MIBRT are also presented.








Abstract
Mechanical information is a medium for perceptual interaction and health monitoring of organisms or intelligent mechanical equipment, including force, vibration, sound, and flow. Researchers are increasingly deploying mechanical information recognition technologies (MIRT) that integrate information acquisition, pre&#8208;processing, and processing functions and are expected to enable advanced applications. However, this also poses significant challenges to information acquisition performance and information processing efficiency. The novel and exciting mechanosensory systems of organisms in nature have inspired us to develop superior mechanical information bionic recognition technologies (MIBRT) based on novel bionic materials, structures, and devices to address these challenges. Herein, first bionic strategies for information pre&#8208;processing are presented and their importance for high&#8208;performance information acquisition is highlighted. Subsequently, design strategies and considerations for high&#8208;performance sensors inspired by mechanoreceptors of organisms are described. Then, the design concepts of the neuromorphic devices are summarized in order to replicate the information processing functions of a biological nervous system. Additionally, the ability of MIBRT is investigated to recognize basic mechanical information. Furthermore, further potential applications of MIBRT in intelligent robots, healthcare, and virtual reality are explored with a view to solve a range of complex tasks. Finally, potential future challenges and opportunities for MIBRT are identified from multiple perspectives.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired Molecular Strategies for Fabricating Functional Materials With Underwater Adhesion and Self&#8208;Healing Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, primarily investigated by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The macroscopic adhesive and self&#8208;healing performances of mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, are correlated with the underlying reversible and dynamic molecular interactions.








Abstract
The exceptional underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing capabilities of mussels have fascinated researchers for over two decades. Extensive studies have shown that these remarkable properties arise from a series of reversible and dynamic molecular interactions involving mussel foot proteins. Inspired by these molecular interaction strategies, numerous functional materials exhibiting strong underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing performance have been successfully developed. This review systematically explores the nanomechanical mechanisms of mussel&#8208;inspired molecular interactions, mainly revealed&#160;by direct force measurement techniques such as surface forces apparatus and atomic force microscopy. The development of functional materials, including coacervates, coatings, and hydrogels, with underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties, is then summarized. Furthermore, the macroscopic material&#160;performances are correlated with the underlying molecular mechanisms, providing valuable insights for the rational design of next&#8208;generation mussel&#8208;inspired functional materials with enhanced underwater adhesion and self&#8208;healing properties.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Nacre&#8208;Inspired 2D Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in nacre&#8208;inspired 2D carbon&#8208;based nanocomposites (TDCNs) based&#8208;graphene and MXene. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to align nanosheets while effectively eliminating voids through interfacial bridging, synergistic toughening, and confined assembly. The resulting densified TDCNs demonstrate exceptional fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, and durability, making them suitable for applications in flexible electronics, bone tissue regeneration, and thermal insulation.








Abstract
Nacre has become the golden standard for the structural design of high&#8208;performance composites due to extraordinary fracture toughness, which exceeds the mixing principle of traditional composites by two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, the unique biomaterials are formed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in low energy consumption and no pollution. It is an effective approach to obtain inspiration from structure&#8208;activity relationships of biomaterials for developing the next&#8208;generation of high&#8208;performance composites. Furthermore, 2D carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and MXene, having exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, are ideal candidates for fabricating new generation high&#8208;performance composites that would replace carbon fiber (CF) composites. This review systematically summarizes relevant works for high&#8208;performance 2D carbon nanocomposites (TDCNs) inspired by nacre. The review first explores structural insights from the nacre. Next, the fabrication strategies of TDCNs are systematically summarized, with an emphasis on achieving highly aligned 2D carbon nanosheets through advanced assembly techniques. Subsequently, the critical role of void defects, which is a key factor governing the mechanical properties of TDCNs, is addressed by analyzing their formation mechanisms, characterization methodologies, and elimination strategies. Finally, the applications and challenges of high&#8208;performance TDCNs obtained through highly aligned assembly and densification processes are discussed.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect in Flexible Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing the Hofmeister effect for smart elasticity control in flexible devices, this review reveals how ion&#8208;material interactions enable simplified and adaptive mechanical regulation. It highlights applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedicine, and outlines a forward&#8208;looking roadmap for developing next&#8208;generation intelligent and responsive materials.








Abstract
The Hofmeister effect has attracted considerable attention for its unique ability to modulate elasticity in flexible devices. Unlike traditional approaches that often involve complex procedures and yield unstable outcomes, the Hofmeister effect enables efficient and controllable elasticity tuning through specific ion&#8208;material surface interactions. This mechanism allows precise regulation of surface wettability, thereby facilitating dynamic adjustment of elastic properties. The review systematically summarizes the research progress on the Hofmeister effect, including its concept, underlying mechanisms, and influencing factors, with a particular focus on its applications in flexible electronics, optics, and biomedical devices. By elucidating the underlying mechanisms of ion&#8208;induced material modulation, the review highlights the potential of the Hofmeister effect to advance the design of next&#8208;generation smart materials. It aims to provide both a theoretical foundation and practical guidance for developing high&#8208;performance flexible systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively examines nature cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs), which achieve molecular&#8208;level emulation of natural cells through precise reconstruction of membrane interfaces. It systematically catalogs diverse natural cell membrane sources, details advanced biofabrication strategies, and elucidates functional mechanisms and therapeutic potential across diverse biomedical applications. The review critically analyzes barriers to clinical translation and discusses potential regulatory solutions for NCINP technologies.








Abstract
Natural cell&#8208;inspired nanoparticles (NCINPs) represent a transformative innovation in nanomedicine, featuring a core&#8211;shell structure coated with isolated natural cell membranes (NCMs) that effectively mimic the functions of native cells. The development of NCINPs achieves molecular&#8208;level emulation of native cells by precisely reconstructing the hierarchical architecture of the bio&#8208;interface, including the structure of the phospholipid bilayer, lipid rafts, protein matrix, and polysaccharide interactions. This advanced biomimetic strategy not only retains the inherent biocompatibility and targeting precision of natural cells but also enables programmable functionalities that surpass those of natural systems, offering enhanced therapeutic potential. In this review, an in&#8208;depth introduction to the background of natural cell&#8208;inspired research is provided, the current prevalent synthesis methods of NCINPs is delineated, and the application mechanisms based on various types of NCMs, as well as their applications in both benign and malignant diseases are elucidated. However, clinical translation faces significant challenges: complex synthesis, compromised membrane functionality, and unpredictable in vivo behavior. The work comprehensively synthesizes the progress, limitations, and challenges encountered throughout the development of NCINPs, while delineating future prospects. Bridging the translational gap from bench to bedside accelerates the clinical translation of NCINPs and fully realizes their therapeutic potential across diverse medical applications.

         <title>Recent Progress on Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Evaporation for Resource Recovery and Pollutant Removal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes bioinspired solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. Beyond clean water production, the multifunctional SDIE expanded its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing interconnected challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) has emerged as a transformative technology for clean water generation by localizing solar&#8208;thermal energy conversion at the air&#8208;liquid interface. Beyond water production, recent advancements reveal its potential as a pivotal platform for addressing the challenges in resource reclamation and environmental sustainability. Drawing inspiration from plant transpiration mechanisms, particularly ion&#8208;selective absorption, long&#8208;distance transport, and bioactive enrichment, this review systematically examines bioinspired SDIE architectures that synergistically integrate membrane separation, adsorption, and photocatalytic processes. The recent progress is summarized across three tiers: 1) structural biomimetics replicating natural plants, 2) functional hybridization coupling complementary purification mechanisms, and 3) hierarchical integration of multi&#8208;process cascades. The review highlights the recent progress in material innovation and structure design to expand its function. Furthermore, implementation frameworks addressing interfacial engineering, process optimization, and system durability are proposed to bridge lab&#8208;scale prototypes with practical applications. The future prospects are also outlined for multifunctional SDIE technologies to address water&#8208;energy&#8208;resource interdependency, advancing their role in sustainable environmental management.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review comprehensively overviews the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to boost ion transport efficiency. It emphasizes the systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures to balance permeability and selectivity. Finally, it provides forward&#8208;looking insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion, including AI integration in nanofluidic design, expanded applications, and technology integration.








Abstract
As industrialization deepens and population surges, the demand for sustainable energy has emerged as a globally critical challenge. Osmotic energy&#8212;generated from Gibbs free energy between different solutions&#8212;stands out as a viable solution to the energy crisis. The key to efficient osmotic energy conversion is the development of nanofluidic materials with high&#8208;selectivity and high&#8208;flux transmembrane ion transport behaviors. This Review provides a comprehensive overview of the latest progress in advanced nanofluidic channels, focusing on optimizing permselectivity to enhance ion transport efficiency. The systematic manipulation of nanochannel architectures is underscored to navigate the inherent balance between permeability and selectivity. Furthermore, the impact of external field regulation on the controlled ion transport within nanofluidic channels, aiming to boost osmotic energy conversion, is explored. At last, visionary insights into the future of osmotic energy conversion are offered, encompassing the combination with artificial intelligence (AI) in nanofluidic design, the expansion of application landscapes, and the integration with other complementary technologies.

         <title>Superwetting Catalysts: Principle, Design, and Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here strategies for constructing superwetting catalyst systems via physical mixing and chemical modification are highlighted. The physical mixing strategy emphasizes the selection and classification of diverse superwetting inorganic materials and polymers, while the chemical modification approach focuses on the design of molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and single&#8208;atom catalysts with tailored surface wettability.








Abstract
Superwettability has revolutionized catalyst design for multiphase reactions by significantly enhancing interfacial interactions and mass transport. Here the design principles and synthesis strategies of superwetting catalysts are primarily introduced, with a particular focus on their confinement effects and mass transport mechanisms. First, the critical roles of superwettability is highlighted in facilitating efficient reactant mass transport, product desorption, and intermediate confinement within catalysts, which are pivotal for optimizing multiphase reaction systems. Besides, the key strategies, including physical mixing and chemical modification, are summarized to engineer superwettability interfaces in catalysts. Particular attention is given to wettability regulation in porous materials such as molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), emphasizing its effect on improving mass transport and confinement effects. The materials used for superwetting catalysts design are summarized. Finally, future directions, including large&#8208;scale fabrication of superwetting membrane reactors, dynamic wettability tuning under operational conditions, and advanced in situ characterization techniques to capture real&#8208;time triple&#8208;phase interfacial phenomena, are outlined. These advancements are poised to expand the application of superwetting catalysts in sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and industrial catalysis, addressing key challenges in multiphase reaction systems.

         <title>Nanostructured Protein Surfaces Inspired by Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harnessing recombinant spider silk technology, bioengineered spidroin variants enable the creation of functionalized nanostructured coatings with tunable affinity for specific targets, supporting a broad range of applications &#8208; from antifouling surfaces and targeted drug delivery to advanced cell therapies and precision bio&#8208;patterning via lithography.








Abstract
Spider silk is renowned for its exceptional mechanical properties, surpassing those of many natural and synthetic materials. This review focuses on biotechnologically produced recombinant spidroin variants inspired by well&#8208;understood major ampullate spider silk proteins (=spidroins), which are role models for understanding molecular composition, architecture, and the nanoscopic and mesoscopic structures formed through self&#8208;assembly and phase separation of spider silk fibers. The use of recombinant spidroins is explored to fabricate functionalized nanostructured surfaces, and molecular engineering is highlighted to tailor the interfacial properties of various morphologies, including particles, capsules, electrospun nanofibers, films/coatings, macroscopic nanofibril&#8208;based hydrogels, and nanohydrogel coatings. One focus is on functionalization of spidroins with peptide tags enabling a variety of affinity&#8208;based targets from cellular markers to inorganic nanoparticles, and allowing for instance specific drug delivery, cell accommodation in hydrogels, or bioselective immobilization of cells on surfaces. Furthermore, applying nanostructured spidroin coatings in combination with photo&#8208; and soft&#8208;lithography techniques is demonstrated, which can be used to produce micro&#8208; and nanostructured patterns exhibiting confined, spidroin&#8208;defined targeting, affinity, or repulsion properties.

         <title>Biological and Biologically Inspired Functional Nanostructures: Insights into Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological and biologically&#8208;inspired functional nanostructures with structural, thermal, optical, and sensing applications are reviewed. The role of nanoscale features in biological materials on performance is described, and their blueprints are used for bio&#8208;inspired nanomaterials, synthesized using advanced techniques (i.e., photolithography, bio&#8208;templating, additive manufacturing), demonstrating analogous functional mechanisms and superior performance relative to conventional materials.








Abstract
Biological materials developed over millennia consist of simple biogenic materials, yet exhibit exceptional functional properties. Leveraging design features from these structures with engineered nanomaterial components can lead to bio&#8208;inspired structures that demonstrate superior performance over traditional engineering materials. We describe nanoscale based architectures in biological systems, their role in enhancement of structural, optical, thermal and sensing properties, and their subsequent translation to bio&#8208;inspired structures. In structurally robust biological materials, we highlight nanoscale design features that enhance strength and stiffness, while retaining toughness. In optically active biological materials, we show how periodic nanostructures manipulate electromagnetic waves resulting in structural coloration as well as antireflective and camouflaging properties. Thermally regulating biological materials utilize nanopores and other nanostructural features to statically or dynamically control temperature. In addition, biological materials that are used in sensing utilize various nanostructures that enhance sensitivity by decreasing activation thresholds for signal transduction. We discuss challenges and opportunities including understanding control mechanisms in the formation of biological materials and leveraging advancements in self&#8208;assembly with new additive manufacturing techniques. The continued evaluation of organisms, including those that exhibit multifunctionality, provides not only new design features and pathways, but significant prospects for innovation in this ever&#8208;emerging field.

         <title>Recent Advances in Reactive Microdroplets for Clean Water and Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reactive microdroplets enable precise and sustainable chemistry at small scales. This review explores their role as confined reactors and dynamic interfaces for synthesizing functional materials, fuels, and microdevices. It offers a critical perspective on how droplet&#8208;based platforms can drive next&#8208;generation technologies in clean energy, environmental remediation, and smart sensing.









Abstract
Microdroplets have emerged as powerful and sustainable platforms for the design and synthesis of functional materials under mild and environmentally friendly conditions. Their unique physicochemical environments &#8208; characterized by high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios and confined internal space &#8208; enable precise control over mass and heat transfer, interfacial energy conversion, and chemical reactions. These features have been harnessed in two main ways: first, by employing microdroplets as microreactors for the fabrication of advanced materials such as polymeric microlenses, artificial compound eyes, metal oxide nanoparticles, and metal&#8208;organic framework microstructures; and second, by using microdroplets as reactive entities to accelerate interfacial reactions relevant to hydrogen and biodiesel production, as well as nitrogen and carbon dioxide fixation. Together, these strategies have driven significant advances in clean energy generation, environmental monitoring, and water treatment. This review provides a critical overview of recent progress in microdroplet&#8208;assisted synthesis of functional materials and their integration in energy and environmental technologies. An emerging direction in the integration of microdroplet&#8208;based systems into adaptive sensing and human&#8208;machine interfaces driven by artificial intelligence is also&#160;highlighted.

         <title>Automated Label&#8208;Free Assay for Viral Detection and Inhibitor Screening via Biomembrane&#8208;Functionalized Microelectrode Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic sensor integrating 2D cell membranes with organic microelectrode arrays enables detection of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 fusion pathways. Natively&#8208;expressed viral receptors promote monitoring of viral entry and screening of antibody&#8208;based inhibitors. Integration with microfluidics further enhances throughput and usability, establishing a powerful platform for investigating viral fusogenicity and accelerating antiviral drug development.








Abstract
Most virus infection assays have indirect readout such as virus number following entry (e.g., PCR, cell lysis). While effective, these technologies are labor&#8208;intensive, require specialized environments (e.g., sterile or RNA&#8208;free), and detect later&#8208;stage viral events like lysis or cell death, lacking sensitivity to early fusion events. To address these limitations, we present biologically relevant 2D membrane materials, host&#8208;cell&#8208;derived supported lipid bilayers (hcd&#8208;SLBs), integrated with organic microelectrode arrays (OMEAs) for detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2)&#160;fusion. By overexpressing angiotensin&#8208;converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptors on the native membranes, the platform functions as a viral sensor capable of detecting virus pseudo particles (VPPs) through the late pathway. Additionally, hcd&#8208;SLBs extracted from human lung epithelium expressing native ACE2 detect fusion events through the early pathway. The platform's utility as a drug&#8208;screening tool is demonstrated by testing antibodies targeting either the ACE2 on the host membrane or the viral spike (S) proteins. To enhance the throughput, microfluidics are integrated for automation and OMEAs are incorporated within each channel, miniaturizing the testing units. This system supports high&#8208;throughput data generation, automation, and scalability, providing an efficient platform for viral fusion detection that advances the study of pathogen&#8208;host interactions and accelerates antiviral drug discovery.

         <title>A Gradient Enamel&#8208;Mimetic Composite via Crisscross Assembly of Aligned Hybrid Nanowires for Excellent Mechanical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites (GEMC) are fabricated by the magnetic&#8208;assisted dual&#8208;directional freezing assembly of amorphous ZrO2 layer&#8208;coated hydroxyapatite nanowires and subsequently, scalable layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly with nanowires&#8217; direction crossed stacking. The enamel analog exhibits high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. Such an enamel biomimetic strategy offers guidelines for the engineering of gradient structure materials with excellent mechanical properties.








Abstract
Materials with excellent comprehensive mechanical properties (e.g., strength and toughness, stiffness and damping, fatigue et&#160;al.) are highly desirable for engineering applications, while it is still challenged for design. Tooth enamel is a typical biomaterial with outstanding mechanical properties that originate from its multiscale and gradient structure. Some composites with enamel&#8208;like multiscale structures are successfully synthesized, but mimicking the gradient structure of tooth enamel is still difficult to realize. Here, an enamel analog is fabricated with a gradient structure similar to inner enamel based on the crisscross assembly of aligned hybrid nanowires through a magnetic&#8208;assisted freeze casting and subsequent mechanical compression strategy. The gradient enamel&#8208;mimetic composites exhibited high strength and toughness surpassing the natural tooth enamel, and simultaneously high stiffness and damping comparable to those of enamel, as well as high fatigue resistance. The interface reinforcement of gradient structure, crystal/amorphous and organic/inorganic, fundamentally accounted for high mechanical performance. The gradient design strategy provides an avenue for the engineering of structural materials with excellent mechanical properties.

         <title>How Does a Delicate Insect Wing Resist Damage? Chitin Orientation Is Adapted to the Mechanical Demands at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale chitin fiber orientations in the insect wing play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber&#8208;reinforced materials.








Abstract
Insect wings achieve an extraordinary balance between structural robustness and lightweight flexibility, enabling efficient and durable flight. This performance arises from their hierarchical composite architecture, where nanoscale chitin fiber orientations play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. Using scanning X&#8208;ray micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;diffraction, the spatial distribution and orientation of chitin fibers in the hindwing of the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria are systematically mapped. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. Finite element simulations further demonstrate how these nanoscale structural adaptations enhance crack resistance, structural integrity, and elastic strain energy distribution, reinforcing vein&#8208;membrane connections for sustained functionality under various loadings. By integrating high&#8208;resolution structural analysis with computational modeling, this study uncovers the sophisticated biomechanical strategies that enable insect wings to endure extreme flight conditions.

&lt;p&gt;Nanoscale chitin fiber orientations in the insect wing play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber-reinforced materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insect wings achieve an extraordinary balance between structural robustness and lightweight flexibility, enabling efficient and durable flight. This performance arises from their hierarchical composite architecture, where nanoscale chitin fiber orientations play a critical role in adapting to complex mechanical demands. Using scanning X-ray micro- and nano-diffraction, the spatial distribution and orientation of chitin fibers in the hindwing of the desert locust &lt;i&gt;Schistocerca gregaria&lt;/i&gt; are systematically mapped. These findings reveal two distinct and functionally adaptive chitin orientation patterns in the membranes that vary regionally, optimizing mechanical resilience and deformation control. Finite element simulations further demonstrate how these nanoscale structural adaptations enhance crack resistance, structural integrity, and elastic strain energy distribution, reinforcing vein-membrane connections for sustained functionality under various loadings. By integrating high-resolution structural analysis with computational modeling, this study uncovers the sophisticated biomechanical strategies that enable insect wings to endure extreme flight conditions. These insights provide a foundation for bioinspired designs in micro air vehicles and advanced fiber-reinforced materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultra&#8208;High&#8208;Power Output in Triboelectric Energy Harvesters by Torrent&#8208;Like Charge Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR) strategy that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges by combining transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture and bio&#8208;inspired vascular system. Compared to traditional energy harvesters, the TCR&#8208;based energy harvester increases the energy density by 100 times, achieving a volumetric peak power density over 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3.








Abstract
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art energy harvesters that harness environmental kinetic energy toward realizing battery&#8208;free Internet of Things (IoT) applications are susceptible to low power density owing to low charge density and high output impedance. Here, a new charge regulation strategy is introduced that simultaneously enhances charge transport rate and the total amount of charges, allowing for achieving a volumetric peak power density exceeding 10 MW&#160;m&#8722;3. It is demonstrated that such an enhanced performance results from the synergistic cooperation between a transistor&#8208;inspired switching architecture that accelerates charge transfer rate whereas minimizing internal impedance and a bio&#8208;inspired charge vascular system that enhances the amount of generated charge, together contributing to a torrent&#8208;like charge regulation (TCR). The unique TCR strategy as well as the induced high power output endows a fully battery&#8208;free wireless sensing and communication platform, highlighting its potential to enable sustainable, distributed battery&#8208;free IoT networks in real&#8208;world applications.

         <title>Anisotropically Thermal&#8208;Protective Porous Ceramics Enabled by Nacre&#8208;Like Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Relying on the porous nacre&#8208;like framework, large&#8208;scale thermal&#8208;protective ceramic is produced via a simple bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly strategy. This porous ceramic achieves the combination of mechanical and anisotropic thermal properties, making it good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.








Abstract
Ever more severe energy dilemma and unfulfilled demands for thermal protection applications have drawn a great interest in developing thermal protective materials. Though great progress is achieved by implementing several advanced micro&#8208;architectures, the conflict between thermal insulation and mechanical properties, along with the complex manufacturing process, remains the main obstacles for fabricating ideal integrated thermal insulation materials. Here, a scalable nacre&#8208;like porous ceramic is reported with a good combination of thermal insulation and mechanical strength (&#8776;0.058&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, 22&#160;MPa) via a bottom&#8208;up film&#8208;to&#8208;bulk assembly. The well&#8208;aligned microplatelets constructed the nacre&#8208;like framework and produced porosity in between for thermal insulation while the mineral bridges between microplatelets connected and strengthened the whole framework. Besides, the structure&#8208;induced anisotropy of thermal conductivity on out&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions provides the possibilities for heat management. Moreover, this material shows an excellent fire&#8208;resistance and maintained performance after fire. These structure&#8208;induced integrated superiorities made this material good candidate for complex thermal protection applications.

         <title>Towards Differentiation in Untethered Microactuators: A Soft Fabrication Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces a fabrication strategy for developing soft microactuators with orthogonally programmed shape, texture, and molecular anisotropy. Using microfluidics to generate liquid crystal droplets encased in hydrogel fibers enables the shaping of droplets into various geometries, which are then magnetically aligned and polymerized to give rise to a diverse library of soft microactuators.








Abstract
This work describes a microfluidic high&#8208;throughput fabrication method for untethered soft microactuators which, while initially unspecific, develop distinct shapes, surface textures, and actuation modes based on various environmental cues. Analogous to the core concept of cell differentiation, the central idea of this technique is to apply controlled mechanical and chemical stimuli to a deformable hydrogel fiber and transmit the induced geometrical and textural changes to embedded droplets. Using liquid crystal (LC) monomer droplets as a core allows&#160;us to orthogonally program the geometric, textural, and molecular architecture of the resulting microactuators upon droplet polymerization. Fine&#8208;tuning of the microfluidic parameters yields microdroplets that dry and transform into microparticles with a variety of shapes, including spindle, rod, pancake, dumbbell, pyramid, and worm&#8208;like assemblies with a range of aspect ratios. Leveraging mechanical instability via rapid dehydration of hydrogel fibers allows us to generate and impart stable 3D patterns to the core, resulting in microparticles that vary both in global shape and surface texture. After polymerizing these precursor droplets in a magnetic field to encode the mesogenic orientation, LCE microactuators are realized with a rich library of shapes, surface patterns, and molecular structures, each displaying distinct deformations upon heating, validated via finite element analysis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Sustained, Continuous Jumping of a Light&#8208;Driven Electronics&#8208;Free Insect&#8208;Scale Soft Robot</title>

         <dc:description>
This work presents a 301 mg soft robot capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics. Coupling snap&#8208;through instability with self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive LCEs yields over 188 nonstop and 800 lifetime jumps, with self&#8208;righting, directional locomotion, sensing, and heavy load&#8208;bearing, advancing long&#8208;lived insect&#8208;scale autonomy.








Abstract
Insects scavenge energy from the environment for self&#8208;sustained operation, and some species use repeated jumping to traverse varied terrain. Such capabilities are desirable for surveillance, disaster recovery, environmental monitoring, and hazardous environment exploration. However, insect&#8208;scale (sub&#8208;gram) robots are typically limited to few jumps due to inefficient integration of energy, actuators, and control. Here, insect&#8208;scale (301&#160;mg) soft robots capable of continuous, autonomous jumping with energy harvesting, actuation, and control embedded in their physical structure without electronics are introduced. Powered by constant light, a single robot achieves 188 nonstop jumps and accumulates over 800 jumps in a year without diminished performance. This behavior is enabled by self&#8208;sustained, repeated snapping (SSRS), a light&#8208;driven mechanism from a self&#8208;shadowing&#8208;induced feedback loop based on dynamic light&#8211;material interplay. The SSRS exploits snap&#8208;through instability and self&#8208;shadowing of photoresponsive liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs), enabling untethered, perpetual actuation, and the snapping dynamics are investigated through simulations and experiments. Beyond sustained motion, the robot demonstrates self&#8208;righting, directional jumping, obstacle negotiation, hazardous gas sensing, and extreme load&#8208;bearing (&#8776;1700 times its weight), highlighting potential for disaster recovery, confined&#8208;space exploration, and environmental monitoring. This work advances insect&#8208;scale robotics toward fully autonomous, long&#8208;lived micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Heterogeneous Nanopore Arrays &#8211; Selective Modification of Nanopores Embedded in a Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 51, December 23, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biological processes rely on the concerted action of channels with different functionalities embedded in the same membrane. Inspired by nature, heterogeneous nanopore arrays are prepared where two nanopores are connected in parallel and function as two different elements of an ionic circuit: a diode and a resistor. The results provide the basis to design ionic circuits that mimic physiological processes and communication.








Abstract
Much effort in the field of nanopore research has been directed toward reproducing the efficient transport phenomena of biological ion channels. For synthetic nanopores to replicate channel function on the scale of a cellular membrane, it is necessary to consider the modes of crosstalk between channels as well as to develop approaches to prepare nanopore arrays consisting of pores with different transport properties, akin to a membrane in an axon. In this manuscript, first ion concentration polarization (ICP) is identified as the primary means of the crosstalk, and subsequently, the extent and degree of ICP is tuned via targeted chemical modification of the pore walls&#8217; functional groups. Next, two fabrication methods of a model two&#8208;nanopore array are presented in a silicon nitride membrane in which one nanopore contains a bipolar ionic junction and functions as an ionic diode, while the other one is a homogeneously charged ionic resistor. The targeted chemical modification of a thin gold layer at the opening of one pore in an array that leaves the other pore located a few tens of nm away, unmodified, is utilized. These results provide an important framework for designing abiotic ionic circuits that can mimic physiological multichannel ion transport and communication.

This perspective summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group. Beyond superwettability, A crucial question is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission? The physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes is revealed, and a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis/energy conversion/information transmission in artificial systems are provided.








Abstract
This Perspective first briefly summarizes the progress of superwettability research in the group over the past 25 years, starting by studying the effect of nanostructure and micro/nanostructure on surface wettability. The intrinsic wetting thresholds for different liquids according to the transition point of superlyophilicty and superlyophobicity on nanostructured surface are experimentally determined, and over 10 superwetting interfacial materials are invented. Recently, the study of dynamic superwettability is focused, which refers to the property of liquids superspreading on 1D or 2D surfaces with micro/nano structures, or partial ordered flow in micro/nano channels, and even the ordered flow of ions and molecules in biological ion channels/water channels/enzyme channels. Furthermore, a crucial question in life science is raised: how can life systems achieve ultralow energy consumption (UEC) in high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission? It is revealed that the ordered directional collective motion of ions/molecules in biological nanochannels is the physicochemical essence to achieve these UEC processes, and provides a summary and perspective on high&#8208;efficiency bio&#8208;synthesis, energy conversion, and information transmission in artificial systems.

         <title>Catechol&#8208;Functionalized Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer for Highly Efficient Sn&#9472;Pb and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conjugated catechol&#8208;anchored self&#8208;assembled monolayer (9&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole, DOPhCz) is designed to enhance molecular packing, reduce interfacial defects, and improve charge extraction, enabling highly efficient and stable Sn&#9472;Pb and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiencies of 24.17% and 28.30%, respectively.








ABSTRACT
The performance of all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is strongly dependent on the properties of Sn&#8208;Pb narrow&#8208;bandgap subcells. Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) such as 2PACz have shown great success in lead&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs), yet their application in Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs remains limited, largely due to suboptimal carrier&#8208;extraction capability and insufficient interfacial stability. Here, we design and introduce a new SAM, 9&#8208;(3,4&#8208;dihydroxyphenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazole (DOPhCz), featuring a conjugated catechol anchoring group, into Sn&#9472;Pb PSCs for the first time. The well&#8208;formed and uniform DOPhCz SAM layer promotes more homogeneous perovskite nucleation and improved crystallinity, lowering interfacial defect density and enhancing device performance compared with phosphonic&#8208;acid&#8208;based [2&#8208;(9Hcarbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl]phosphonic acid (2PACz)M. In addition, DOPhCz accelerates hole extraction and reduces chemical perturbation during device operation. As a result, the DOPhCz&#8208;based Sn&#9472;Pb PSC achieves a power conversion efficiency of 24.17%, outperforming its 2PACz&#8208;based counterpart (22.87%) and exhibiting significantly improved operational stability. When applied in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells, a high efficiency of 28.30% is obtained. This work establishes a coherent mechanism for SAM&#8208;induced interfacial stabilization and provides valuable insights for molecular engineering of high&#8208;performance all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.

         <title>Dynamic Optical Lattices Through Conducting Polymer&#8208;Gated Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The conducting polymer gate is incorporated into organic dielectric lattices to control the dynamic switching of nonlocal Mie resonances in the visible/NIR regions. The &#8220;closed gate&#8221; from oxidized PEDOT confines the light within dielectric nanocylinders and activates nonlocal Mie resonances, while the &#8220;opened gate&#8221; from reduced PEDOT facilitates optical leakage from the dielectric nanocylinders to the substrate, which eliminates the Mie resonances. 








ABSTRACT
Organic metasurfaces based on conducting polymers are emerging as new opportunities for active nano&#8208;optic devices, but their tunable plasmonic resonances are limited to infrared wavelengths (&#8805;960&#160;nm) and mainly with low quality&#8208;factors (Q &lt; 2). Here we propose the concept of a &#8220;conducting polymer gate&#8221; to endow organic metasurfaces with switchable high&#8208;Q nonlocal resonances within the visible/NIR&#8208;I regime (640&#8211;950&#160;nm). Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is integrated into organic dielectric nanocylinder lattices and serves as a gate that controls optical leakage from the nanocylinders to the substrate. The quasi&#8208;metallic PEDOT blocks such leakage channel and induces light confinement within the dielectric nanocylinders despite their low refractive index (ndie &lt; 1.7). This facilitates the generation of Mie collective lattice resonances (CLRs) at the air superstrate with Q&#8208;factor reaching 25, which is &#8764;16 times higher than previously reported organic metasurfaces near this spectral regime. Converting the PEDOT into its dielectric state opens the leakage channel and eliminates the CLRs, which can be reversibly switched by redox reactions. The concept of conducting polymer&#8208;gated optical confinement in low&#8208;index nanostructures provides new routes for intelligent nano&#8208;optics including dynamic nonlocal metasurfaces.

         <title>Charge&#8208;Transfer&#8208;Coupled J&#8208;Aggregation Enhances ROS Generation via Efficient Intermolecular Electron Transfer for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;transfer&#8211;coupled J&#8208;aggregates enable efficient intersystem crossing and intermolecular electron transfer, markedly boosting Type I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for superior in vivo antibacterial photodynamic therapy. This approach overcomes the ROS inefficiency of traditional Coulomb&#8208;coupling J&#8208;aggregated photosensitizers, establishing a foundational framework for the rational design of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers.








Abstract
Aggregation engineering of organic photosensitizers (PSs) is a promising strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, current approaches primarily rely on traditional long&#8208;range coulomb&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregate (JC) that exhibit suboptimal Type II ROS production and weak intermolecular electron transfer (InterET), which is unfavorable for Type I ROS generation. Here, we report a charge&#8208;transfer (CT)&#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates (JCT) as efficient organic PS (BDR NPs) to significantly enhance both Type I and Type II ROS production for superior PDT. Unlike traditional JC&#8208;aggregates, JCT &#8208;aggregates exhibit both accelerated intersystem crossing for improved Type II ROS generation and enlarged intermolecular orbital overlap that promotes efficient InterET for Type I ROS production. Therefore, BDR NPs achieve 8.2&#8208; and 4.1&#8208;fold increases in superoxide (O2&#8722;&#8226;) and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) production, respectively, compared with its JC&#8208;counterparts. Notably, BDR NPs exhibit an over 2&#8208;fold higher production of O2&#8722;&#8226; and &#8226;OH compared with commercial PS Rose Bengal, achieving markedly accelerated wound healing. This superior PDT efficacy arises from the synergistic suppression of inflammation and activation of tissue regeneration. This work elucidates the mechanistic basis of JCT&#8208;aggregate in enhancing ROS production, offering a foundational framework for designing high&#8208;performance PSs.

&lt;p&gt;Charge-transfer&#8211;coupled J-aggregates enable efficient intersystem crossing and intermolecular electron transfer, markedly boosting Type I/II reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation for superior in vivo antibacterial photodynamic therapy. This approach overcomes the ROS inefficiency of traditional Coulomb-coupling J-aggregated photosensitizers, establishing a foundational framework for the rational design of high-performance photosensitizers.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aggregation engineering of organic photosensitizers (PSs) is a promising strategy to enhance reactive oxygen species (ROS) production for photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, current approaches primarily rely on traditional long-range coulomb-coupled J-aggregate (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) that exhibit suboptimal Type II ROS production and weak intermolecular electron transfer (&lt;i&gt;Inter&lt;/i&gt;ET), which is unfavorable for Type I ROS generation. Here, we report a charge-transfer (CT)-coupled J-aggregates (&lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;CT&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) as efficient organic PS (BDR NPs) to significantly enhance both Type I and Type II ROS production for superior PDT. Unlike traditional &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-aggregates, &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;CT&lt;/sub&gt; -&lt;/i&gt;aggregates exhibit both accelerated intersystem crossing for improved Type II ROS generation and enlarged intermolecular orbital overlap that promotes efficient &lt;i&gt;Inter&lt;/i&gt;ET for Type I ROS production. Therefore, BDR NPs achieve 8.2- and 4.1-fold increases in superoxide (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8226;) and hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) production, respectively, compared with its &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;-counterparts. Notably, BDR NPs exhibit an over 2-fold higher production of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#8226; and &#8226;OH compared with commercial PS Rose Bengal, achieving markedly accelerated wound healing. This superior PDT efficacy arises from the synergistic suppression of inflammation and activation of tissue regeneration. This work elucidates the mechanistic basis of &lt;i&gt;J&lt;sub&gt;CT&lt;/sub&gt;-&lt;/i&gt;aggregate in enhancing ROS production, offering a foundational framework for designing high-performance PSs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Field&#8208;Free, Deterministic Giant Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Switching of 1.3 T Perpendicular Magnetization With Symmetry&#8208;Lifted Topological Surface States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We show a giant, bias&#8208;field free, deterministic, spin&#8208;orbit&#8208;torque switching of perpendicular hard magnets with HC over 1.3&#160;T. By combining the three&#8208;fold 3m symmetry from topological insulator surface states with the rectangular mm2 symmetry from the 2&#160;x&#160;1 intercalation in Cr3Te4, the interface symmetry is significantly reduced into a unidirectional m symmetry and produces the extremely strong, deterministic perpendicular switching.








ABSTRACT
The field&#8208;free control of perpendicular magnetization using spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is a key challenge in spintronics, simplifying design and integration for both memory and logic applications. Unlike conventional heavy metal/ferromagnet heterostructures that already break out&#8208;of&#8208;plane symmetry, thus can readily offer in&#8208;plane switching, realizing deterministic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane switching requires breaking additional in&#8208;plane symmetries. In this study, we demonstrate field&#8208;free switching in a heterostructure composed of a self&#8208;intercalated 2D magnet, Cr3Te4, and a topological insulator, (Bi0.75Sb0.25)2Te3. In this system, the surface states of the topological insulator ensure efficient charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion, but not deterministic on its own. The ordered 2&#160;&#215;&#160;1 self&#8208;intercalation of the perpendicular magnet provides additional symmetry breaking on the interface, rendering a combined unidirectional m (Cs) symmetry. This synergy allows for extremely strong, field&#8208;free SOT switching of Cr3Te4 with perpendicular coercivity &#8776;1.3&#160;T. Unlike exfoliated 2D materials that tend to be single&#8208;crystal, our wafer&#8208;scale deposition naturally nucleates three equivalent types of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;1 sublattices, and therefore the combined SOT switching manifests an apparent three&#8208;fold angular dependence. These findings highlight a promising pathway toward efficient, topological insulator&#8208;based spintronic device and material engineering.

         <title>Improving Ionic Conformality Across Polymer Electrolyte|Electrode Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer electrolytes typically form physically intimate electrode interfaces but often fail to maintain continuous ionic pathways, critically limiting battery performance. Through strategic compositional design, this study introduces a molecular ionic composite electrolyte that effectively reduces interfacial ionic depletion, ensuring consistent ion transport. Enhanced ionic conformality is directly visualized, improving cycling stability in solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
Maintaining uniform ionic transport at electrode|electrolyte interfaces, i.e., ionic conformality, remains challenging in polymer electrolyte (PE)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries. Morphological conformality does not necessarily imply ionic conformality. In PEs, which typically consist of a mechanically supporting component and distinct ionically conductive components, the rearrangement or depletion of mobile ion&#8208;conductive domains at interfaces can disrupt ionic transport pathways. Such localized ionic depletion contributes to interfacial instability and capacity degradation in high&#8208;voltage lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, an electrolyte design approach aimed at minimizing interfacial heterogeneities is demonstrated through compositional adjustments, characterized by spatially resolved structural and chemical X&#8208;ray techniques and NMR diffusometry to elucidate ion transport dynamics. This approach improves ionic conformality at electrode interfaces, enhancing cycling stability in Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NMC811) coin and pouch cells cycled at high voltages. These results contribute to understanding interfacial behaviors in multiphase PEs and inform strategies for improving stability across solid&#8208;state battery interfaces.

         <title>Demystifying Tunneled Niobium Molybdenum Oxide With Near&#8208;Zero&#8208;Strain for Hydrogen Bond&#8208;Assisted Ammonium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A second&#8208;level prepared 3D tunnel&#8208;structured niobium molybdenum oxide (Nb2Mo3O14) is developed for ammonium ion (NH4+) storage with a near&#8208;zero volume strain. Combining an unusual hydrogen bond match mechanism involves fast NH4+ migration in small&#8208;sized tunnels under weak hydrogen bonding interactions, which enables Nb2Mo3O14 to achieve high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;stability anode material for aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








ABSTRACT
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs) have emerged as compelling contenders for sustainable large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the advancement is significantly impeded by the dearth of energetic electrode materials and unclear relationship between diffusion kinetics and channel size. Herein, we present a second&#8208;level prepared 3D tunnel&#8208;structured binary transition metal oxide&#8212;niobium molybdenum oxide (Nb2Mo3O14)&#8212;as a high&#8208;performance anode material for AAIBs. Comparative electrochemical evaluations across various metal ion systems (Li+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, Ca2+) reveal that Nb2Mo3O14 exhibits superior storage performance specifically for NH4+ ions with a near&#8208;zero&#8208;strain characteristic. In ammonium acetate electrolyte, Nb2Mo3O14 electrode delivers a high specific capacity of 210.9 mAh g&#8722;1, at a current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1, accompanied by an exceptional capacity retention of 88.9% after 14,000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the promotion of NH4&#8314; storage under hydrogen bond chemistry is dependent on the matched size of the tunnels. The relatively weak hydrogen bonds promote the efficient motion of bulky NH4+ in 3D tunneled Nb2Mo3O14. These findings highlight 3D tunnel&#8208;like binary transition metal oxides as valuable models for high&#8208;performance ammonium&#8208;ion storage, paving the way for the development of advanced AAIBs.

         <title>Beyond Rigid Frameworks: A Dynamic 2D Supramolecular Organic Network of Luminescent Radicals in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble luminescent radical self&#8208;assembles with cucurbit[8]uril into a 2D honeycomb supramolecular organic framework (SOF) in water. This framework exhibits enhanced optical and magnetic properties and, notably, features reversible disassembly and reassembly upon thermal stimuli, providing a dynamic platform for constructing adaptive radical&#8208;based materials.








ABSTRACT
We report the design and synthesis of a water&#8208;soluble luminescent radical, TTM&#8208;3IMB, which spontaneously assembles with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) into a well&#8208;defined 2D honeycomb supramolecular organic framework (SOF) in aqueous solution. Unlike conventional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) or metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the resulting SOF exhibits dynamic and reversible assembly behavior. Heating to 90&#176;C triggers disassembly of the framework, while subsequent cooling to room temperature induces reassembly, as confirmed by temperature&#8208;dependent fluorescence and EPR spectra. This reversible process enables modulation of spin&#8211;spin interactions and excited&#8208;state dynamics within the framework. The SOF architecture not only enhances the photostability of TTM&#8208;3IMB by four times but also increases its photoluminescence quantum efficiency from 2.0% to 5.0%. Multiscale characterization, including EPR, SEM, SAXS, and SQUID measurements, reveals an ordered honeycomb morphology and weak antiferromagnetic coupling among radical units. This work introduces a dynamic supramolecular strategy for constructing open&#8208;shell 2D materials in water, offering new opportunities for tunable optoelectronic, magnetic, and bioresponsive applications.

This framework exhibits enhanced optical and magnetic properties and, notably, features reversible disassembly and reassembly upon thermal stimuli, providing a dynamic platform for constructing adaptive radical-based materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ABSTRACT&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We report the design and synthesis of a water-soluble luminescent radical, TTM-3IMB, which spontaneously assembles with cucurbit[8]uril (CB[8]) into a well-defined 2D honeycomb supramolecular organic framework (SOF) in aqueous solution. Unlike conventional covalent organic frameworks (COFs) or metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), the resulting SOF exhibits dynamic and reversible assembly behavior. Heating to 90&#176;C triggers disassembly of the framework, while subsequent cooling to room temperature induces reassembly, as confirmed by temperature-dependent fluorescence and EPR spectra. This reversible process enables modulation of spin&#8211;spin interactions and excited-state dynamics within the framework. The SOF architecture not only enhances the photostability of TTM-3IMB by four times but also increases its photoluminescence quantum efficiency from 2.0% to 5.0%. Multiscale characterization, including EPR, SEM, SAXS, and SQUID measurements, reveals an ordered honeycomb morphology and weak antiferromagnetic coupling among radical units. This work introduces a dynamic supramolecular strategy for constructing open-shell 2D materials in water, offering new opportunities for tunable optoelectronic, magnetic, and bioresponsive applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Effective Single&#8208;Atom Catalytic Descriptor for Accelerating Sulfur Reduction Reaction in Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work establishes a universal electronic descriptor (&#952;&#8208;&#967;) linking transition metal properties to sulfur electrochemistry kinetics. The &#952;&#8208;&#967; metric predicts Li2S2 conversion barriers across 3d/4d&#8208;TM@NG catalysts with 0.90 correlation, identifying V@NG and Mo@NG as top performers. Transferable to sodium&#8208;sulfur systems without recalibration, it enables electronic&#8208;structure&#8208;driven catalyst design beyond adsorption&#8208;based approaches for next&#8208;generation batteries.








ABSTRACT
The solid&#8208;solid Li2S2&#8208;to&#8208;Li2S transition represents a fundamental bottleneck in sulfur electrochemistry, critically governing reaction kinetics and energy efficiency in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries (LSBs). While single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) show promise in modulating this process, the absence of intrinsic descriptors linking atomic&#8208;scale electronic properties to macroscopic catalytic performance has hindered rational catalyst design. Here, we establish a universal electronic descriptor, &#952;&#8208;&#967;, defined as the difference between the valence electron count (&#952;) and electronegativity (&#967;) of transition metal (TM) centers. This descriptor quantitatively correlates d&#8208;band modulation and interfacial charge redistribution with catalytic activity, circumventing the conventional reliance on polysulfide adsorption configurations. Systematic screening across 3d/4d&#8208;TM@nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene (NG) systems reveals a strong &#952;&#8208;&#967; dependence of the energy barriers for the Li2S2&#8208;to&#8208;Li2S conversion, with a correlation coefficient (R2) of about 0.90. Descriptor&#8208;guided screening not only identifies V@NG, Ti@NG, and Nb@NG as outperforming benchmark catalysts consistent with experimental validation but also uncovers the Mo@NG system, which exhibits superior catalytic activity. Notably, &#952;&#8208;&#967; exhibits transferability to sodium&#8208;sulfur batteries (NSBs), accurately predicting Na2S2&#8208;to&#8208;Na2S kinetics trends without requiring system&#8208;specific recalibration. This work marks a paradigm shift from configuration&#8208;dependent simulations to electronic&#8208;structure&#8208;driven catalyst design, providing atomic&#8208;level insights into sulfur electrochemistry for both LSBs and NSBs catalysts.

         <title>Resonant Interlayer Coupling in NbSe2&#8208;Graphite Epitaxial Moir&#233; Superlattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory derived calculations, this work reveals strong interlayer coupling and moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states in molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy grown van der Waals heterostructures of monolayer&#8208;NbSe2/graphite, with implications for its collective phases that form.








Abstract
Moir&#233; heterostructures, created by stacking 2D materials together with a finite lattice mismatch or rotational twist, represent a new frontier of designer quantum materials. Typically, however, this requires the painstaking manual assembly of heterostructures formed from exfoliated materials. Here, clear spectroscopic signatures of moir&#233; lattice formation in epitaxial heterostructures of monolayer (ML) NbSe2 grown on graphite substrates are observed.&#160;Angle&#8208;resolved photoemission measurements and theoretical calculations of the resulting electronic structure reveal moir&#233; replicas of the graphite &#960; states forming pairs of interlocking Dirac cones. Interestingly, these intersect the NbSe2 Fermi surface at the k$k$&#8208;space locations where NbSe2's charge&#8208;density wave (CDW) gap is maximal in the bulk. This provides a natural route to understand the lack of CDW enhancement for ML&#8208;NbSe2/graphene as compared to a more than fourfold enhancement for NbSe2 on insulating support substrates, and opens new prospects for using moir&#233; engineering for controlling the collective states of 2D&#160;materials.

         <title>Opportunities of Semiconducting Oxide Nanostructures as Advanced Luminescent Materials in Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review discusses the challenges of wide and ultrawide bandgap semiconducting oxides as a suitable material platform for photonics. They offer great versatility in terms of tuning microstructure, native defects, doping, anisotropy, and micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structuring. The review focuses on their light emission, light&#8208;confinement in optical cavities, and their prospects for single photon sources. 








Abstract
The luminescence properties of semiconductors are key to the development of photonics. In recent years, the targeted semiconductor materials have shifted from narrow&#8208;bandgap to wide&#8208; and ultra&#8208;wide&#8208;bandgap ones, which means spanning the domains of operation for devices beyond those possible with conventional semiconductors in the fields of high&#8208;power devices and deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors. Furthermore, materials nanostructures with one or more dimensions at the nanoscale drive additional novelties in their optical properties, boosting innovative features. The next step in advanced materials necessarily goes through the quantum &#8211; photonic link, in which electromagnetic waves and electronic quantum states display all possible degrees of freedom. To achieve effective advances in this field, both innovative research in materials science and the development of suitable strategies to assess the quantum signatures in the material systems under study are required. This work reviews the fascinating light emission and confinement in wide and ultra&#8208;wide bandgap semiconducting oxides of technological interest in nanostructured form, focusing on their luminescence and the key role they can play in future quantum photonic technologies, such as single photon sources and quantum sensing. Finally, an outlook on future avenues in research is&#160;outlined.

         <title>Liquid Metal Microrobots for Magnetically Guided Transvascular Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metal&#8208;based microrobots combine magnetic steering, intrinsic X&#8208;ray visibility and softness, to navigate blood vessels even against flow. Under clinically relevant magnetic fields, liquid metal microrobots roll along vessel walls, cross endothelial barriers, and accumulate in target tissues. Their robust motion and imaging contrast highlight their potential for minimally invasive, image&#8208;guided biomedical interventions.








Abstract
Soft microrobots, compared with their rigid counterparts, offer superior adaptability in dynamic and confined biological environments. Here, magnetically&#8208;guided liquid metal microrobots composed of gallium&#8208;indium alloys embedded with Fe nanoparticles are introduced. The unique combination of magnetic maneuverability, high surface tension, intrinsic radiopacity, and deformability allows liquid metal&#8208;based microbots to overcome limitations of both hard microrobots and fragile droplet&#8208;based systems. Under magnetic actuation, liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microrobots exhibit controllable rolling and upstream locomotion resembling neutrophil&#8208;like navigation, enabling precise maneuvering even against physiological flow. Bridging in vitro with in vivo experiments, quail egg chorioallantoic membrane models are used to demonstrate guided transport of these microrobots through blood vessels, accumulation at tumor xenografts, and migration within subcutaneous tissues. Moreover, their strong X&#8208;ray visibility enables real&#8208;time fluoroscopic tracking, validated in porcine heart vasculature. Importantly, liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microbots can cross endothelial barriers in a vascular flow&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip platform, while maintaining endothelial biocompatibility. By integrating deformability, magnetic steerability, and imaging visibility, liquid metal&#8208;based microrobots establish a powerful platform for minimally invasive transvascular navigation. This work highlights the potential of liquid metal&#8208;based magnetic microrobots for targeted drug delivery, image&#8208;guided therapy, and intelligent biomedical interventions.

         <title>Dynamic Geminal&#8208;Atom Coordination for Highly Efficient Photo&#8208;Fenton Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu based geminal&#8208;atom catalyst leverages inert carbonate ions in seawater to dynamically reorganize active centers, enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. In situ spectroscopy and theory reveal reversible Cu&#8208;CO32&#8722; coordination and accelerated charge transfer, achieving 17&#8208;fold higher &#183;OH yield, efficient pollutant and Chlorella degradation, and proven environmental and economic sustainability.








ABSTRACT
Understanding and leveraging non&#8208;reactive species in natural environments to modulate the active centers of geminal&#8208;atom catalysts (GACs) is crucial for enhancing their catalytic performance. Here, we develop a two&#8208;coordinated copper geminal&#8208;atom catalyst and reveal that the ubiquitous yet inert carbonate ions (CO32&#8722;) in seawater dynamically reorganize the coordination environment of active copper sites, thereby enhancing photo&#8208;Fenton reactivity. Control experiments, in situ spectroscopy and theoretical modeling demonstrate that CO32&#8722; induces reversible coordination transformations that modulate the electronic structure and facilitate interfacial charge transfer, resulting in a 17&#8208;fold increase in hydroxyl radical production. This effect enables efficient degradation of diverse marine pollutants, including effective Chlorella decomposition under natural sunlight. Life&#8208;cycle and technoeconomic assessments further demonstrate the environmental benefits and economic feasibility of this approach. Overall, this work establishes a generalizable strategy for active geminal&#8208;atom catalysts via environmentally abundant species, offering mechanistic insights and scalable pathways toward large&#8208;scale and sustainable aquatic pollution remediation.

         <title>Lattice Mismatched Platinum&#8208;Tellurium@Platinum&#8208;Ruthenium Core@Shell Nanorods Achieve Ultrahigh Alkaline Hydrogen Electrocatalysis for Dual Practical Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of LM&#8208;PtTe2@PtxRu NRs (x = 2, 4, 9, 12, 16) have been constructed for highly efficient alkaline HER and HOR catalysis, in which the optimized LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru NRs with moderate lattice mismatch degree of 18.7% exhibit the best HER, HOR, and their MEA performances, demonstrating an unprecedented potential for dual AEMWE and AEMFC devices.








ABSTRACT
Lattice mismatch engineering is necessary yet challenging for core@shell structured platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts in alkaline hydrogen electrocatalysis. Herein, a series of lattice mismatched Pt&#8208;tellurium@Pt&#8208;ruthenium core@shell nanorods (LM&#8208;PtTe2@PtxRu NRs, x = 2, 4, 9, 12, 16) are constructed for alkaline hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). The optimized LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru/C exhibits much better HOR and HER performances versus commercial PtRu/C and Pt/C. More importantly, its ultrahigh membrane electrode assembly (MEA) power densities of 26.4/21.0&#160;W mgPt+Ru&#8722;1 in H2&#8208;O2/H2&#8208;air media for anion exchange membrane fuel cell (AEMFC) and remarkable MEA performance of 1.55 V@0.5&#8201;A cm&#8722;2/2.0 V@5.8&#8201;A cm&#8722;2 for AEM water electrolysis (AEMWE) outperform the vast majority of PtRu&#8208;based catalysts reported to date, displaying an unprecedented potential in dual practical devices. The lattice mismatch degree of 18.7% between trigonal PtTe2 and cubic Pt9Ru induces numerous lattice dislocations and unusual lattice strain effect in LM&#8208;PtTe2@Pt9Ru/C, which simultaneously optimizes the surface electron distribution and the adsorption of intermediates, responsible for its high hydrogen catalysis performance. This work aims to achieve the high&#8208;performance MEA catalysis for AEMFC and AEMWE with lattice mismatch engineering induced by these well&#8208;organized PtRu&#8208;based core@shell nanocatalysts.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Artificial Photosynthetic Machinery for Carbon Dioxide Capture and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) is constructed for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.








ABSTRACT
Producing value&#8208;added chemicals directly from CO2 powered by sunlight offers a sustainable approach to addressing both environmental and economic challenges. However, the inherent chemical stability of CO2 poses a grand challenge in achieving highly active and selective CO2 conversion. Herein, we develop a biohybrid semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic system that integrates carbonic anhydrase (CA) and a CuZn nanozyme photosensitizer with a dendritic polymer (PPA) for the sustainable transformation of CO2 into dimethyl carbonate (DMC). The PPA&#8208;wrapped CA/CuZn can capture CO2 to form active intermediates. Through photo&#8208;induced charge transfer under visible light illumination, the CA/CuZn@PPA system achieves 100% selectivity for DMC production at room temperature and low CO2 pressure.

         <title>Operationally Stable Perovskite Solar Modules Enabled by MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Crystallization and Passivation via Scalable Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable, air&#8208;processed blade&#8208;coating of Cs&#8211;FA perovskites is enabled by CsPbX3&#8211;NMP inks and optimized Br incorporation, yielding dense films with controlled crystallization. A newly designed CHCA passivator ensures homogeneous surface interactions. The integrated strategy delivers high module efficiency and exceptional operational stability, advancing perovskite photovoltaics toward practical commercialization.








ABSTRACT
Perovskite solar modules (PSMs) must deliver not only high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) but also long&#8208;term operational stability to approach commercialization. Yet efficiency and stability are both compromised when translating laboratory spin&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) into scalable PSMs, owing to mismatched crystallization dynamics, ineffective defect passivation, and compositional degradation. Here we resolve these challenges through a three&#8208;pronged strategy. First, we deconstruct the compositional origins of operational stability, identifying MA (methylammonium)&#8208;free Cs&#8211;FA (formamidinium) composition as intrinsically robust against continuous operation. Second, we tailor the phase&#8208;transition and crystallization pathways of air&#8208;processed scalable&#8208;coating by controlled Br incorporation in CsPbX3, which reconciles precursor solubility, nucleation kinetics, and &#945;&#8208;phase stability, yielding dense and defect&#8208;suppressed films. Finally, we analyze the root cause of scalable passivation inefficacy and developed cyclohexanecarboxamidinium (CHCA) as a blade&#8208;coating&#8208;compatible passivator enabling uniform and durable defect suppression. The optimized devices exhibited improved PCEs up to 26.1% (0.646 cm2) and 22.8% (20.8 cm2). Meanwhile, we documented exceptional operational stability with &#8764;3200&#160;h T96 for PSC and &#8764;2000&#160;h T84 for PSM. Our findings establish a mechanistic framework for achieving operationally stable perovskite solar modules under industrially relevant conditions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Focusing on organic liquid electrolytes toward commercialization, this review links solvent&#8211;salt&#8211;additive chemistry with electrode requirements, operational extremes, and manufacturability considerations. By aligning electrolyte formulation with emerging high&#8208;energy cathodes, high&#8208;capacity anodes, and real&#8208;world deployment scenarios, it provides a practical framework for advancing competitive, scalable high&#8208;energy sodium&#8208;ion battery technologies.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as one of the most promising candidates among post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) due to abundance and low cost of sodium resources. However, the commercialization of SIBs is hindered by their limited cell performance. Although great efforts have been made, it is still challenging to balance the trade&#8208;off between energy density and cycle life while simultaneously meeting the requirements for practical applications, which are largely governed by the stability of the electrode/electrolyte interfaces. Therefore, it is crucial to design new electrolyte components or formulations to stabilize the interphases and thus the cycling stability for high&#8208;energy and high&#8208;capacity cathodes/anodes. In this review, based on a comprehensive comparison of the fundamental mechanisms between SIBs and LIBs, the challenges and governing principles for electrolyte design in SIBs are first introduced. The progress in electrolyte designs for various high&#8208;energy cathodes is summarized according to their ion&#8208;transport characteristics and the interphase formation. Electrolyte design strategies, particularly for the high&#8208;capacity anodes, are also surveyed, together with effective electrolyte design strategies to fulfill the requirements under practical operating conditions. Finally, future perspectives on electrolyte development from the viewpoints of full cell&#8208;level performance, cost, and feasibility are highlighted. This review aims to provide a roadmap for advancing electrolyte design toward practical&#160;SIBs competitive with LIBs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Dual&#8208;Color Fluorescence With Large Stokes Shift From Dye&#8208;Encapsulated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Dynamic Cellular Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable dual&#8208;emitting MOF&#8208;based material is constructed by integrating spiropyran as a cascade ET mediator with two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (C153) and methylene blue (MB) into rho&#8208;ZMOF. The system exhibits dynamically switchable green/red fluorescence with a large Stokes shift, showing great promise for high&#8208;resolution, depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging applications.








ABSTRACT
Photoswitchable dual&#8208;color fluorescent materials are highly valuable for applications in cellular imaging and super&#8208;resolution microscopy. However, realizing these materials, especially broadening their Stokes shift remains a critical challenge. Herein, a novel strategy for achieving photoswitchable dual&#8208;emission fluorescence with a large Stokes shift is proposed via a cascade energy transfer (ET) process in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs). By incorporating the photoisomerizable molecule spiropyran as an ET intermediate, and two fluorescent dyes coumarin 153 (Cou153) and methylene blue (MB) within a MOF, rho&#8208;ZMOF, the dual&#8208;color dynamic luminescent material rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB is achieved. When excited at 400&#160;nm, rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB exhibits coumarin&#8208;centered green emission at 516&#160;nm and methylene blue&#8208;centered red fluorescence at 700&#160;nm, with a maximum Stokes shift of 300&#160;nm. More importantly, these dual&#8208;color emissions can be reversibly switched on or off upon altering UV&#8208; and visible&#8208;light irradiation because of the photoswitchable cascade energy transfer from coumarin 153 to methylene blue based on the photochromic transformation of spiropyran. As an example, the potential use of rho&#8208;ZMOF&#8835;Cou153&amp;SP&amp;MB in high&#8208;resolution and depth&#8208;resolved bioimaging is demonstrated.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance NIR&#8208;II Sn&#8208;Based Perovskite LEDs Enabled by the Functionalization of Sulfaguanidine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, we demonstrate that the incorporation of sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules effectively passivates Sn2+&#8208;related defects in CsSnI3 perovskite. Moreover, SG molecules promote the growth of crystals with improved morphological uniformity and facilitate balanced carrier injection. As a result, CsSnI3&#8208;SG light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an emission peak at 948 nm achieved a record EQE of 8.1%.








ABSTRACT
Eco&#8208;friendly CsSnI3&#8208;based perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with the emission peak extending to the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) region hold tremendous potential for applications in biological monitoring, night vision, and optical communications. However, the various defects caused by the instability of Sn2+ within the CsSnI3 film, and the non&#8208;equilibrium carrier injection rate in the devices are the two major factors that limit the device performance. Here, we report high&#8208;performance NIR&#8208;II CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs achieved by employing functional sulfaguanidine (SG) molecules. Due to the strong S&#9552;O&#9472;Sn coordination bonds, NH2&#183;&#183;&#183;I&#8722; hydrogen bonds could be formed between CsSnI3 and SG, which effectively eliminated various Sn(II)&#8208;related defects in the CsSnI3 film. Moreover, the SG molecules significantly improved the morphological uniformity and regulated the carrier injection balance, resulting in more balanced carrier injection that enhanced the effective radiation recombination rate. Consequently, the optimized CsSnI3&#8208;SG PeLEDs achieved a breakthrough external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.1%, which is the highest efficiency reported for CsSnI3&#8208;based PeLEDs to date.

         <title>Reconfigurable Multi&#8208;Stimuli Responsive Smart Phosphorescent Polymer Composites with Time&#8208;Dependent and Wavelength&#8208;Dependent Phosphorescence Color Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New reconfigurable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color variation modulated by multiple stimuli are prepared, which promotes the development of smart security technologies with multi&#8208;dimensional and multi&#8208;level encryption capabilities.








ABSTRACT
Developing smart systems based on phosphorescent materials that can control the time&#8208;dependent phosphorescent color (TDPC) in response to external stimuli holds promise for advancing information encryption, but significant challenges remain. Herein, a facile strategy is proposed to construct smart phosphorescent polymer composites through immobilizing dual&#8208;emission centers with distinct stimuli sensitivities within a soft&#8208;rigid coupled hybrid matrix. The smart phosphorescent polymer composites show switchable phosphorescence between static phosphorescence and wavelength&#8208;dependent dynamic TDPC, induced by multi&#8208;stimuli (light, humidity, heat). The photoactivated phosphorescent composites transform from initial static monochromatic emission to dynamic multicolor TDPC through the synergistic effect of triplet oxygen depletion&#8208;induced selective activation of the emission centers and the distinct decay rates of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The evolution paths of TDPC also exhibit excitation&#8208;dependence. Moreover, the photoactivated composites enable reversible switching between dynamic TDPC and monochromatic phosphorescence through water and thermal stimuli, due to the combined effects of water&#8208;induced dissociation of the rigid hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and differential quenching of the dual&#8208;emission centers. The composites also exhibit recyclability and self&#8208;healing capability. The processable smart phosphorescent polymer composites with good stability demonstrate outstanding potential in multi&#8208;dimensional information encryption, opening up a new perspective for upgrading security technologies.

         <title>Solar Energy Storage in Polyoxometalate for On&#8208;Demand Hydrogen Transportation and Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under sunlight irradiation, the semiconductor can transfer photogenerated electrons to polyoxometalates, enabling a unique system that achieves spatiotemporal separation of light absorption, electron storage, and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production.








ABSTRACT
Widespread application of solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is hindered by critical limitations: the inherent safety risks of high&#8208;pressure H2 storage/transport, and the intermittent nature of solar energy. To address these challenges, we develop a solar energy storage and on&#8208;demand hydrogen production system by synergistically integrating commercial polyoxometalate (NH4)6H2W12O40 (W12) with graphitic carbon nitride (g&#8208;C3N4). This system demonstrates remarkable efficiency in storing solar energy as electrons within W12 during illumination. These stored electrons can be released on demand in the dark through Pt/C activation to produce H2, achieving a highly efficient hydrogen evolution rate of 3220&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under dark photocatalytic conditions. Notably, the system maintains robust performance under real&#8208;world conditions, delivering an outdoor hydrogen evolution rate of 954&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under natural sunlight irradiation. Detailed analysis reveals an optimized electron storage&#8208;release pathway, facilitated by the favorable alignment between the reduction potential of W12 and the band structure of g&#8208;C3N4, as well as the electrostatic self&#8208;assembly driven by oppositely charged g&#8208;C3N4 and W12. In this system, solar energy is facilely stored as stabilized electrons within the POM&#8208;semiconductor suspension, which can then be efficiently transported to light&#8208;deficient environments and controllably released for on&#8208;demand hydrogen evolution.

These stored electrons can be released on demand in the dark through Pt/C activation to produce H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, achieving a highly efficient hydrogen evolution rate of 3220&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under dark photocatalytic conditions. Notably, the system maintains robust performance under real-world conditions, delivering an outdoor hydrogen evolution rate of 954&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under natural sunlight irradiation. Detailed analysis reveals an optimized electron storage-release pathway, facilitated by the favorable alignment between the reduction potential of W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; and the band structure of g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the electrostatic self-assembly driven by oppositely charged g-C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and W&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;. In this system, solar energy is facilely stored as stabilized electrons within the POM-semiconductor suspension, which can then be efficiently transported to light-deficient environments and controllably released for on-demand hydrogen evolution.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Mediated Gradient Oxygenophilic Architecture on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy for Dynamic Spillover and Bifunctional Hydrogen Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise control of competitive adsorption behavior of H* and OH* intermediates represents a fundamental challenge in hydrogen electrocatalysis. By engineering gradient oxyphilic sites within high&#8208;entropy alloys, we create continuous energy landscapes that enable low&#8208;barrier spillover pathways, break conventional scaling relations, and overcome kinetic limitations&#8212;transcending the static Sabatier principle through dynamic surface regulation.








ABSTRACT
Breaking scaling relations and overcoming kinetic limitations in multistep hydrogen electrocatalysis remains a fundamental challenge. In this work, we designed and synthesized a high&#8208;entropy alloy catalyst comprising Ir, Ru, Mo, W, and Cu supported on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon spheres. This unique structure creates active sites with a quasi&#8208;continuous distribution of binding energies for H* and OH* intermediates. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the random spatial arrangement of sites enables low&#8208;energy&#8208;barrier spillover pathways for H* and OH* (&#967;H*max = 0.27&#160;eV; &#967;OH*max = 0.61&#160;eV), while continuous d&#8208;orbital coupling facilitates efficient electron transfer. This design enables each elementary step of hydrogen oxidation and evolution reactions (HOR/HER) to be directed to a site with favorable energetics. As a result, it exhibits exceptional bifunctional performance with a HOR mass activity of 8.83 A mg&#8722;1 and an HER overpotential of only 11&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, significantly outperforming commercial Pt/Ccom and previously reported catalysts. Operando spectroscopy and DFT analyses reveal that the gradient energy landscape promotes dynamic intermediate spillover, preventing site blocking and enhancing reaction kinetics. This work establishes a universal design strategy develop high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts that transcend conventional Sabatier principle limitations.

         <title>Programmable Multicolor Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Hydrogels via the Synergy of Freeze&#8208;Soaking and Salting&#8208;Out</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out strategy enables multicolor room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) hydrogels. By embedding phosphors within polymer microcrystalline domains, this method yields long&#8208;lived afterglow (&gt;10 s) in highly hydrated and flexible gels. Emission color and lifetime can be finely tuned through salt type, concentration, or dye incorporation, highlighting a broadly adaptable platform for phosphorescent soft materials.








Abstract
Room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is rarely achieved in hydrogel systems, as water severely quenches their emission. Achieving multicolor RTP in hydrogels is even more challenging, despite its high potential in cutting&#8208;edge applications such as advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting and camouflaging skins. Here, a universal strategy is presented to fabricate multicolor RTP hydrogels through the cascading freeze&#8208;soaking and salting&#8208;out process (F&#8208;S method). This method induces in situ polymer assembly around the phosphors, providing effective confinement and protection against quenching. As a result, RTP hydrogel (RTPgel) with strong phosphorescence (lifetime &gt; 200&#160;ms and afterglow &gt;10 s), high water content (71 %), and excellent flexibility (stretchability &gt; 3000%) is achieved in a modal system composed of polycyclic aromatic boronic acids (PABAs)&#8208;grafted polyvinyl alcohol (PVA). Since chain aggregation strongly correlates with the kosmotropic nature of the salt solution, the phosphorescence properties, including lifetime and intensity, are feasibly tunable by re&#8208;soaking the hydrogels in solution with different types of salts or concentrations, enabling programmable spatiotemporal emission patterns. Such a method is universal, adaptable for various luminophores and polymer matrices, allowing customizable emission colors across a wide spectrum. Moreover, it is compatible with scalable, high&#8208;precision fabrication techniques such as fiber spinning, direct ink writing (DIW), and digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing.

         <title>An Injectable and Modular NO&#8208;Adaptive Delivery System for Modulating Regenerative Microenvironment in Long&#8208;Segment Nerve Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electroactive nerve conduit integrating ROS&#8208;responsive NO&#8208;releasing nanoparticles and microgel&#8208;based hydrogels was developed for long&#8208;segment nerve repair. Adaptive NO release modulates inflammation, oxidative stress, angiogenesis, and mitochondrial function, while interconnected macroporous microgels support cell infiltration and axonal growth. Magnetically induced electrical stimulation further enhances neurotrophic factor secretion and directional nerve regeneration.








Abstract
Repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries remains a significant clinical challenge, hindered by oxidative stress, inflammation, insufficient revascularization, and limited axonal regeneration speeds. This study addresses these barriers by reconstructing the nerve regeneration microenvironment, enhancing cell migration, and accelerating axonal growth. An integrated regenerative microenvironment combining chemical signals, micro/nano structures, and electrical stimulation is developed. Specifically, nitric oxide (NO), a versatile signaling molecule, is dynamically released using sustained and responsive&#8208;release strategies to regulate oxidative stress and inflammation effectively. Furthermore, a gelatin&#8211;lipoic acid&#8211;seleno&#8208;lipoic acid (Gel&#8208;LA&#8208;SA) microgel&#8208;based hydrogel is designed, forming interconnected macroporous scaffolds that significantly enhance cell infiltration and growth compared to traditional hydrogels. Additionally, a non&#8208;invasive electroactive conduit is constructed to provide external electrical stimulation, promoting nerve cell migration and nerve growth factor secretion. Together, these elements guide axonal regeneration, support rapid revascularization, and enhance nutrient supply. By integrating NO signaling, advanced hydrogel scaffolds, and electrical stimulation, this multifunctional conduit effectively addresses the critical barriers to regenerating nerves across extensive defect sites, offering a promising approach for repairing long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injuries and providing insights into broader applications for neurological disease treatment and tissue regeneration.

         <title>Bulk Fabrication of Space&#8208;Confined CsPbI3 Nanocrystal Films Toward Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;Red LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulk fabricated CsPbI3 nanocrystal films of &#8764;700&#160;nm emission are demonstrated with strong space confinement and minimized trap density. Modulated grain nucleation and growth, together with Lewis base coordination, enable the crystallization of high quality CsPbI3 nanocrystals. The resultant deep&#8208;red PeLEDs achieve a record EQE of 23.4% and an ultrahigh luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2.








ABSTRACT
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with 690&#8722;710&#160;nm emission show high significance in optical, agricultural, and biomedical applications. As primary candidates for deep&#8208;red emitters, all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 films suffer from fused large grains with abundant trap states, leading to inferior performance of deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). Here we report CsPbI3 nanocrystal films with strong space confinement and notable performance at &#8764;700&#160;nm of deep&#8208;red emission via bulk fabrication. The dual roles of diaza&#8208;18&#8208;crown&#8208;6 dihydriodide additive as crystallization regulator and Lewis base ligand trigger more nucleation sites, retarded grain growth and passivated trap states, ensuring the crystallization of high&#8208;quality space&#8208;confined CsPbI3 nanocrystal films. This approach establishes a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% for deep&#8208;red PeLEDs, and achieves a maximum luminance of 10152&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Low roll&#8208;off is also demonstrated that EQE maintain over 20% under a high current density of 900&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art deep&#8208;red organic and quantum&#8208;dot LEDs. The T50 operating lifetime is estimated to be 234 h at an initial radiance of 6.3&#160;W sr&#8722;1 m&#8722;2. This work provides an effectual strategy to accelerate radiative recombination and enhance the performance of CsPbI3&#8208;based deep&#8208;red PeLEDs.

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Adaptive Artificial Synapses with High Linearity for Intelligent Computing in Extreme Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) is developed based on VO2 nanoparticles, capable of neuromorphic computing under extreme high pressures up to &#8776;15 GPa.








Abstract
The ongoing exploration of the physical world has intensified the demand for intelligent computing in extreme environments. However, intelligent devices operating under extreme high&#8208;pressure conditions are limited by the pressure tolerance of the materials used for intelligent computing. A pressure&#8208;adaptive artificial synapse (PAAS) using VO2 (M1) nanoparticles is developed, leveraging the increased lattice rigidity during the M1&#8208;to&#8208;M1&#8217; phase transition (1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa), which causes the photoinduced insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition to be Mott dominated. The PAAS demonstrated a stable operating current, a superior biomimetic plasticity (maximum paired&#8208;pulse facilitation index from 109.6% to 155.4%), and an improved postsynaptic current linearity (Pearson's r from 0.64 to 0.97) from 1 atm to 15.1&#160;GPa. Furthermore, an artificial neural network mapped by PAAS under high pressure achieved a validation accuracy of 95%&#8211;97% in handwritten digit recognition. The PAAS is also applied to a convolutional autoencoder for denoising reconstruction of color images.

         <title>Ferroelectric Transistors: from Materials Innovation to Intelligent Electronic Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review surveys ferroelectric materials systems and polarization mechanisms, elucidates the device physics and engineering of three&#8208;terminal ferroelectric transistors, compares dielectric and semiconductor&#8208;based operation principles, and summarizes performance challenges and optimization strategies. It further reviews Ferroelectric transistor applications in nonvolatile memory, neuromorphic, and AI hardware, and outlines prospects for scalable, low&#8208;power, multifunctional electronics.








Abstract
The explosive growth of artificial intelligence, big data, and the Internet of Things is driving an unprecedented demand for computing power and energy efficiency. However, conventional von Neumann architectures are increasingly constrained by the physical and economic limits of transistor scaling in the post&#8208;Moore era. Ferroelectric transistors (FeFETs) are far more than a novel memory technology and instead represent a revolutionary platform that seamlessly integrates nonvolatile storage, in&#8208;memory computation, and multi&#8208;modal sensing into a single, energy&#8208;efficient device, overcoming&#160;the bottlenecks of traditional computing architectures. This review provides a comprehensive overview of ferroelectric materials, including perovskite oxides, hafnium&#8208;based compounds, organics, and emerging 2D systems, emphasizing their polarization original mechanisms and structureproperty relationships. This study focuses on the device physics and engineering of three terminal FeFETs, with particular attention to the current issues, optimization strategies, and contrasting operation principles of ferroelectric dielectric and semiconductor&#8208;based designs. Finally, the expanding applications of FeFETs in nonvolatile memory, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence hardware from device to system integration is discussed, and an outlook toward scalable, low&#8208;power, and multifunctional electronics driven by ferroelectric innovation is presented.

         <title>Designing Synergistic Lewis Acid&#8208;Base Pairs in Compressed Bismuth&#8208;Copper Oxide for Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Formate Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compressive lattice strain strengthens synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base pairs (Bi&#8211;VO&#8211;Cu) in a bimetallic oxide catalyst via metal&#8208;oxygen bond contraction, optimizing the electronic structure for selective CO2 reduction. The strain&#8208;engineered catalyst achieves stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;formate conversion with &gt;95% Faradaic efficiency across industrial current densities and outstanding operational stability over 120 h, offering a general design principle for atomic&#8208;scale catalytic systems.








ABSTRACT
Electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reduction (CO2RR) to formate represents a sustainable pathway for carbon utilization, yet its industrial deployment remains hindered by insufficient current density and stability of the electrocatalysts. While lattice strain engineering can modulate catalytic performance by altering electronic structures, a major challenge is the lack of a clear mechanistic understanding connecting the induced strain to the activity enhancement. Herein, by precisely engineering lattice strain in an atomically integrated catalytic system, we establish a definitive intrinsic structure&#8208;activity relationship, moving beyond conventional correlations with apparent properties. Combined experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that compressive strain effectively modulates the electronic structure of the Cu d&#8208;orbital and the local electronic states of oxygen vacancies, thereby enhancing the cooperation within the Lewis acid&#8211;base pairs. This mechanism facilitates CO2 adsorption and activation, stabilizes the key *HCOO intermediate, and significantly lowers the reaction energy barrier. Consequently, the catalyst exhibits high formate Faradaic efficiency (&gt;95%) over a broad current density range (&#8722;100 to &#8722;700 mA cm&#8722;2), achieving 96.1% at &#8722;576.8 mA cm&#8722;2. This research not only elucidates the synergistic Lewis acid&#8208;base catalytic mechanism at the molecular level but also provides universal design principles for the sustainable electro&#8208;synthesis of value&#8208;added formate.

         <title>Control of Covalent Bond Enables Efficient Magnetic Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant and reversible magnetocaloric effect (MCE) is achieved by tuning covalency through sub&#8208;unit&#8208;cell chemical engineering, establishing a novel design principle for effective hysteresis control in magnetocaloric materials.








Abstract
Magnetic cooling, harnessing the temperature change in matter when exposed to a magnetic field, presents an energy&#8208;efficient and climate&#8208;friendly alternative to traditional vapor&#8208;compression refrigeration systems, with a significantly lower global warming potential. The advancement of this technology would be accelerated if irreversible losses arising from hysteresis in magnetocaloric materials are minimized. Despite extensive efforts to manipulate crystal lattice constants at the unit&#8208;cell level, mitigating hysteresis often compromises cooling performance. Herein, we address this persistent challenge by forming Sn(Ge)3&#8722;Sn(Ge)3 bonds within the unit cell of the Gd5Ge4 compound. This approach enables an energetically favorable phase transition, leading to the elimination of thermal hysteresis. Consequently, we achieve a synergistic improvement of two key magnetocaloric figures of merit: a larger magnetic entropy change and a twofold increase in the reversible adiabatic temperature change (from 3.8 to 8 K) in the Gd5Sn2Ge2 compound. Such synergies can be extended over a wide temperature range of 40&#8211;160 K. This study demonstrates a paradigm shift in mastering hysteresis toward simultaneously achieving exceptional magnetocaloric metrics and opens up promising avenues for gas liquefaction applications in the longstanding pursuit of sustainable energy solutions.

De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202509221), Jiong Lu, Yafei Zhao, Shibo Xi, and co&#8208;workers introduce a de&#8208;saturation strategy that efficiently converts the CuN4 into CuN3 under a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock. The resulting de&#8208;saturated CuN3 catalysts promote copper&#8211;alkyny formation and significantly enhance catalytic performance. Symbolically, the CuN4&#8212;with a molecular weight of exactly 120&#8212;celebrates the 120th anniversary of NUS.

         <dc:description>
Accurate in vitro recreation of the tumor microenvironment, particularly the complex cancer&#8211;stromal interactions, is essential for deciphering cancer biology and advancing therapies. This review summarizes fundamental design principles for developing physiologically faithful tumor models, surveys recent technological and translational developments, and provides guidance for selecting modeling approaches based on specific&#160;research questions. Outstanding&#160;challenges and future directions are also discussed.








Abstract
Accurate in vitro modeling of the tumor microenvironment (TME) is essential for advancing our understanding of cancer biology and for developing effective anti&#8208;cancer therapeutics. Context&#8208;dependent and patient&#8208;specific, the dynamic interactions between cancer cells and stromal elements significantly affect tumor progression and treatment response. Recent advances in biomaterials, microdevices, and molecular analysis techniques have facilitated the development of in vitro tumor models that better replicate these cancer&#8208;stromal interactions. In turn, these models have deepened the understanding of cancer biology, leading to the discovery of new prognostic markers and establishing preclinical platforms that more reliably predict clinical outcomes. However, challenges persist in fully capturing the immense complexity of the TME and translating these models for real clinical impact. In this review, key design principles for creating physiologically relevant tumor models are first described, then the latest advances in tumor modeling that have contributed to new biological insights and progress in drug development are discussed.

         <title>From Pollution to Value: Electrochemical Systems for Transforming Flue Gas into Chemicals and Fuels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a comprehensive overview of the strategies whereby low&#8208;concentration CO2 in flue gas can be directly valorized to value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels. It covers recent progress in integrated CO2 capture and conversion, including amine and bi(carbonate) reduction&#8208;based systems. This study also focuses on how the presence of impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides can be overcome.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) can enable the production of fuels and chemicals from CO2 emissions. Direct flue gas conversion can address the emissions from hard&#8208;to&#8208;abate sectors, including cement, steel, and power generation industries. Such integration with SCO2RR can also decarbonize the petrochemical industry and eliminate separation and purification steps. Here, recent progress and emerging opportunities for transformative flue&#8208;gas&#8208;tolerant systems for producing fuels and chemicals are reviewed. The review begins by analyzing recent progress in direct flue gas conversion and highlighting emerging micro&#8208;reaction environment features. Next, performance degradation mechanisms associated with flue gas conversion in CO2RR systems are discussed. Following this, the bicarbonate reduction reaction (BRR) and CO2RR from amine&#8208;based capture as emerging strategies for high&#8208;rate, selective, and stable electrosynthesis of chemicals from feeds containing low CO2 concentrations are highlighted. Finally, the mitigation of flue gas impurities such as oxygen, sulfur oxides, and nitrogen oxides, is discussed,&#160;and perspectives for emerging opportunities are shared.

This review highlights recent advances in 2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), with a focus on programmable pore architectures and functional skeletons. It underscores the critical roles of porosity and framework design in facilitating adsorption and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as in developing semiconductors with electronic properties vital for energy storage and conversion applications.








Abstract
2D open framework materials (2D OFMs), including metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs), have emerged as a versatile class of materials that combine atomic precision, intrinsic porosity, and tunable chemical functionality. By bridging the structural features of inorganic layered materials with the chemical diversity of organic polymers, 2D OFMs provide unique opportunities in molecular separations, semiconductors, and related technologies. Their in&#8208;plane periodicity and layered architectures enable precise control over pore environment, stacking mode, and electronic coupling, thereby unlocking structure&#8211;property relationships not accessible in conventional porous materials. This review highlights recent advances in the topological design of 2D OFMs, incorporating functional skeletons and programmable pore architectures, as well as emerging characterization techniques capable of resolving structural details or providing high&#8208;resolution imaging at the atomic scale. Particular attention is given to the roles of porosity and the framework skeleton in enabling adsorptive and membrane&#8208;based separations, as well as to semiconductors with electronic properties that underpin energy storage and conversion applications. By providing a comprehensive overview of current progress and future directions, this review underscores the technological promise of 2D OFMs. The advances summarized here establish a foundation for further innovation and practical deployment across diverse scientific and engineering domains.

         <title>Design Strategies and Roles of Hydrogels for Sustainable Energy Conversion and Harvesting from Natural and Biological Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizes their unique contributions to energy conversion. It provides insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.








Abstract
The growing demand for sustainable energy has spurred interest in harvesting ambient sources, such as solar radiation, mechanical vibrations, water flow, and temperature gradients, and biological activities, such as motion and respiration. In this context, hydrogels have emerged as promising materials bridging natural and physiological energy environments. Known for their polymer networks and biocompatibility, hydrogels are widely used across bioengineering, biomedicine, and agriculture. Beyond these applications, hydrogels are also gaining attention in environmental and energy&#8208;related technologies, including solar&#8208;driven desalination, catalysis, and energy generation and storage. Their appeal lies in unique physicochemical properties, stimuli&#8208;responsiveness, tunable interfacial chemistry, environmental benignity, and efficient mass and heat transfer while maintaining mechanical compatibility with hybrid or soft&#8211;hard systems. Despite these promising attributes, few reviews focus on the role of hydrogels in energy harvesting. This review addresses that gap by examining hydrogel&#8208;based technologies driven by environmental stimuli and emphasizing their unique contributions to energy conversion. It offers insights into design strategies and recent advancements in functional hydrogels, highlighting opportunities and challenges in this field. As hydrogel&#8208;based energy harvesting evolves, innovative design, deeper mechanistic understanding, and interdisciplinary integration are needed to unlock its potential.

         <title>Advances in Intelligent Nano&#8208;Micro&#8208;Scale Sensors and Actuators: Moving toward Self&#8208;Sustained Edge AI Microsystems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents a system&#8208;level synthesis of advances enabling next&#8208;generation Edge&#8208;AI microsystems: transduction materials and mechanisms, hybrid photonic&#8211;MEMS platforms, rigid and stretchable devices, in/near&#8208;sensor computing, and tribo/piezo energy harvesting. Integrating photonics&#8208;enabled sensing and AI across edge and cloud will yield autonomous, human&#8208;centric systems and energy&#8208;aware AIoT, including digital&#8208;human twins and city sensing commons across healthcare, industry, and smart cities.








Abstract
Over recent decades, nano&#8208;micro&#8208;scale sensors and actuators have evolved from discrete microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) components. As demand for maintenance&#8208;free systems grew, developments emphasized integrating energy harvesting into sensing platforms and deploying self&#8208;powered sensors that utilize piezoelectric and triboelectric transducers. Such co&#8208;localization enabled self&#8208;sustained Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things (IoT) deployments, supporting continuous operation without external power and improving network autonomy and scalability. Integrating artificial intelligence (AI) at the sensor edge has further transformed these platforms into intelligent AI&#8208;of&#8208;Things (AIoT) systems, enabling multimodal analytics, adaptive decision&#8208;making, and immersive human&#8211;machine interaction. Concurrently, advances in photonics&#8212;including mid&#8208;infrared, terahertz, and near&#8208;infrared technologies&#8212;have produced sensitive molecular and chemical sensors with improved selectivity and spectral resolution. These advances have also yielded photonic integrated circuits capable of ultrafast in&#8208;sensor computation and real&#8208;time Bayesian photonic neural inference, delivering sophisticated edge&#8208;AI processing with low latency and power consumption. Hybrid systems that combine flexible wearable electronics with integrated photonic platforms have emerged, allowing direct transduction and interpretation of mechanical and physiological signals from flexible sensors via photonic chips. Progress in materials, packaging, and system co&#8208;design underpins reliability and operation in harsh environments. Together, these advances foreshadow highly integrated, self&#8208;sustained edge&#8208;AI microsystems that embody perpetual, real&#8208;time intelligence and seamless user&#8211;environment interaction.

         <title>Targeted ROS Scavenging for Disease Therapies Using Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, their mechanisms, classifications, and targeting strategies for disease treatment. It discusses progress, challenges, and perspectives for future clinical applications of ROS&#8208;related nanomedicines.








Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are essential by&#8208;products of cellular metabolism and serve as key mediators in cell signaling and homeostasis. Excessive ROS production is associated with cellular damage and various diseases. Therefore, targeted ROS scavenging may enhance therapeutic efficacy and minimize side effects. With significant progress in nanotechnology, various nanomaterials with targeted ROS&#8208;scavenging properties have been developed to modulate ROS levels in biological microenvironments. In this review, the mechanisms underlying ROS generation and elimination in humans and in ROS&#8208;related diseases are first outlined. The latest advancements in ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials, particularly their mechanisms and composition&#8208;based classifications, are then focused on. Strategies for improving the targeting ability of ROS&#8208;scavenging nanomaterials and their application in the therapeutics of ROS&#8208;induced diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, acute kidney injury, diabetic wounds, and cancer are highlighted. Finally, the challenges faced by ROS&#8208;targeted nanotherapeutics are discussed, and possible alternatives to accelerate their clinical translation are proposed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Impurity&#8208;Induced Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), emphasizing the critical role of trace impurities. Their origins, mechanisms, and potential applications are discussed for RTP systems while underscoring the importance of purity analysis to avoid misinterpretations and ensure an accurate understanding of RTP mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with large Stokes shifts and prolonged afterglows are gaining increasing attention in a variety of applications, including displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high&#8208;performance organic RTP remains challenging due to weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, rapid non&#8208;radiative decay, and unstable triplet excitons. Early studies focused on crystal engineering, as ordered lattices restrict molecular motion and stabilize triplet excitons. Analyzing crystal structures and packing provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions, while theoretical calculations have clarified electronic structures, laying the foundation for rational RTP material design. However, recent findings suggest RTP in many single&#8208;component systems may arise from trace impurities, significantly influencing RTP properties. This discovery has greatly advanced the understanding of impurity&#8208;induced phosphorescence. This review systematically examines the role of impurities in RTP, detailing their origins from starting materials, solvents, and side reactions. It also explores how these identified impurities can serve as essential building blocks for designing new RTP materials. Finally, essential methods for evaluating compound purity, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous analysis and validation are presented. Material purity plays a pivotal role in RTP research, as impurities can distort experimental data, potentially leading to misinterpretations that can impede advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

         <dc:description>
The tunability of band gap enables wide bandgap perovskites to serve as top subcells shared by various emerging tandem technologies. Based on the application of wide bandgap perovskites in perovskite/silicon, perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS tandem solar cells, this review outlines the theory, progress, challenges, and future path of wide bandgap perovskites.








Abstract
The global demand for clean energy is driving the need for next&#8208;generation solar technologies with higher power conversion efficiencies. Multijunction solar cells, which stack absorbers with cascaded bandgaps, offer a compelling path forward by more efficiently utilizing the solar spectrum. Among these, metal halide perovskites stand out for their bandgap tunability, enabling efficient tandem solar cells (TSCs) when paired with a range of semiconductors&#8212;including perovskite/perovskite, perovskite/silicon, perovskite/organic, and perovskite/CIGS. Central to these architectures are wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, which harvest high&#8208;energy, short&#8208;wavelength photons. This review highlights recent advances and challenges in perovskite&#8208;based TSCs, focusing on the photophysical properties and application of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites across different tandem configurations. Future research directions are outlined aimed at enhancing performance and long&#8208;term stability to accelerate industrial deployment.

         <title>Utilize Natural Forces in Water Treatment Through 3D&#8208;Printed Structures: From Purification to Clean Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed functional materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water treatment, including oil/water separation, photodegradation, desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the unique benefits conferred by structural design. Integrated design and modular manufacturing workflow are proposed, promoting standardized production and collaborative development to accelerate design iteration.








Abstract
The utilization of natural forces for water purification has long been a pursuit of scientific and technological interest, offering the potential to reduce both energy consumption and secondary pollution associated with conventional processes. Structural materials play a pivotal role in water treatment by harnessing natural forces, such as gravity, capillarity, and solar energy, to purify water or even to generate clean energy from water, enabling structure&#8208;determined properties beyond material functionality. With their advantages in design freedom and structural customization, 3D printing techniques offer significant potential for materializing these designs into functional devices. This review investigates recent advances in 3D&#8208;printed materials and devices that utilize natural forces for water purification, including gravity&#8208;driven oil/water separation, solar&#8208;powered photodegradation, solar evaporation desalination, and photovoltaic water splitting for clean energy, with a particular focus on the benefits conferred by structural design. Harnessing the holistic design freedom and modular manufacturing capabilities afforded by 3D printing, the approach proposes an integrated water treatment system where an oil/water separator and a photodegradation module are assembled with solar evaporators to generate purified water for photovoltaic water splitting. This design aims to establish a conceptual framework that enables rapid iteration, collaborative innovation, and digital model&#8208;based standardization across the field.

         <title>Dry Transfer of CVD Graphene Film Using Adhesion Switchable Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrostatic charge doping of graphene can tailor its adhesion to the copper surface, thus enabling etchant&#8208;free dry delamination. A switchable ferroelectric P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) film first acts as a graphene transfer support layer, where polarization controls adhesion to peel graphene from copper, and subsequently releases graphene onto SiO2 substrates upon depolarization. This method yields clean graphene with low crack density and is extendable to other 2D materials.








Abstract
Although chemical vapor deposition (CVD) produces meter&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality graphene (Gr) on copper (Cu) foils, its practical integration is hampered by challenges in the transfer process. Conventional wet transfers are slow, produce chemical waste, and lack scalability, whereas existing dry transfer methods struggle with mechanical damage and residues due to strong Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion and the difficulty in precisely tuning interfacial forces. Here, a fully dry, industrially compatible transfer platform utilizing a ferroelectric poly(vinylidene&#8208;fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) film with electrostatically switchable adhesion, serving as both a mechanical support and a transfer layer, is demonstrated. Negative Corona poling of P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) induces p&#8208;type doping in graphene. Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr&#8208;Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8208;Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large&#8208;scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm&#8208;scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality 2D material films.

Density Functional Theory calculations confirm that this simultaneously reduces Gr-Cu adhesion while increasing P(VDF-TrFE)-Gr adhesion, enabling clean, large-scale graphene delamination from Cu foils with &amp;gt;99% coverage. Subsequent thermal annealing above P(VDF-TrFE)&#8217;s Curie temperature (&#8776;135&#160;&#176;C) depolarizes the film, neutralizing the interfacial charge for a clean release. The versatility of this method is shown for other two-dimensional (2D) materials, including molybdenum disulfide and hexagonal boron nitride. Crucially, the process has been validated on cm-scale samples using a fully automated system with a transfer time of &amp;lt;5 min, highlighting a viable path toward industrial-scale production of high-quality 2D material films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spatially Programmable Electroadhesive Enables In Situ Site&#8208;Selective Functional Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A light&#8208;activated, in situ spatially programmable bioadhesive (STICH) enables microscale, site&#8208;selective integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue. It achieves robust mechanical bonding and low&#8208;impedance electrical coupling, enabling reconfigurable neuromodulation and directional electromechanical sensing in vivo and ex vivo.








Abstract
Precise intraoperative integration of bioelectronic devices with wet tissue surfaces remains a challenge due to the limited spatial control of adhesion sites. Here, an in situ spatially programmable electrical bioadhesive (termed &#8220;STICH&#8221;)&#160;is reported that enables site&#8208;selective adhesion and functional coupling via light&#8208;activated bonding with wet biological tissue. Upon irradiation with patterned green light, Rose Bengal in a chitosan/silver nanowire hydrogel matrix generates singlet oxygen, which oxidizes amino acid residues into carbonyl groups on the tissue surface. The covalent bonding is then formed between the newly formed reactive carbonyl group and amine groups on chitosan. The spatially programmable adhesive allows robust tissue bonding with a lap&#8208;shear strength of 160&#160;kPa and precise adhesion regions at &#8776;2 &#181;m resolution. The light&#8208;patternable adhesive enables spatially resolved mechanical coupling for directional electromechanical sensing on ex vivo cardiac tissue. The low impedance adhesive interface also provides spatially programmed electrical coupling for in vivo neuromuscular stimulation on intraoperatively selected muscle groups. This platform advances microscale device&#8208;tissue integration and paves the way for reconfigurable bioelectronic therapies.

         <title>Self&#8208;Spiking Linear Neuromorphic Soft Pressure Sensor for Underwater Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel design of a neuromorphic pressure sensor that can generate self&#8208;spiking symmetric signals with direct event&#8208;based encoding through the integration of magnetic spheres and alternating coil circuits. The key advantages of this work include high linearity up to 200&#160;kPa (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997), self&#8208;spiking behavior for simplified signal processing, and robust underwater stability.








Abstract
Many aquatic vertebrates rely on neuromasts in their lateral line system to detect water vibrations and pressure gradients. These neuromasts contain specialized hair cells that function as mechanoreceptors, converting mechanical stimuli into electric signals for brain processing. While neuromorphic sensors can emulate biologic sensory systems, they are facing significant challenges in underwater stability and complex data processing. Here, a bioinspired neuromorphic soft pressure sensor designed for stable underwater performance and simplified signal processing is proposed. This is achieved through a novel integration of micro&#8208;magnetic spheres, a microfluidic channel, and alternating coil connections. This sensor exhibits self&#8208;spiking behavior upon applied force with high linearity (R2&#160;=&#160;0.997) in response to pressure changes up to 200&#160;kPa. The proposed mechanism generates distinct magnetic action potentials via its alternating coil design, enabling efficient signal processing. This artificial neuromast achieves 92.19% accuracy in game control applications and 94.71% accuracy in underwater object recognition using machine learning. Additionally, the sensor was validated in both experimental ocean basins and open&#8208;sea environments, confirming its potential for underwater robotics, ocean environmental monitoring, and marine industrial applications.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Coordinated Trienzyme Nanogel Cascade Therapy for Accelerated Post&#8208;Pancreatectomy Cutaneous Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;coordinated nanogel assembly is reported that co&#8208;delivers three enzymes to regulate glucose, oxidative stress, and oxygen levels. This system mimics natural enzyme cascades to reprogram the wound environment after pancreatectomy. In a post&#8208;pancreatectomy mouse model, it accelerates healing by reducing infection, promoting blood vessel growth, and supporting tissue regeneration. The design offers a modular strategy for post&#8208;surgical therapy.








Abstract
Orchestration of enzyme cascades in synthetic systems remains a major challenge for catalytic control in complex biological environments. Here, a zinc&#8208;coordinated tri&#8208;enzyme nanogel system (Zn@nGSC) is reported that mimics natural enzymatic assemblies by confining individual glucose oxidase (GOX), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) within an imidazole&#8208;functionalized polymeric nanogel matrix. The nanogel is fabricated via mild in situ polymerization combined with Zn2&#8314;&#8208;imidazole coordination, yielding structurally stable multi&#8208;enzyme assemblies. The engineered assemblies demonstrate simultaneous preservation of enzymatic activity and enhanced cascade efficiency under thermal and proteolytic stress. Cascade reactions proceed as follows: i) glucose is depleted by GOX, ii) superoxide radicals are scavenged by SOD to alleviate oxidative stress, and iii) residual H2O2 is converted into oxygen by CAT in order to mitigate hypoxia. Functionally, Zn@nGSC restores redox balance and metabolic homeostasis, demonstrated in a murine model of post&#8208;pancreatectomy wound healing, with emphasis on treating hyperglycemia and improving regeneration. Another pronounced advantage of Zn@nGSC treatment is its antibacterial effect, which enhances angiogenesis, collagen deposition, and immune modulation. Overall, this modular nanoplatform provides a blueprint for designing robust, bioresponsive cascade systems with therapeutic potential in metabolically compromised microenvironments.

         <title>Reconfigurable Magnetotransport in MnBi2Te4 via Gate and Magnetic Field Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gate&#8208;tunable magnetoresistance sign reversal under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields is observed in an ultrathin MnBi2Te4 device, arising from spin reorientation and distinct scattering mechanisms. Moreover, angular&#8208;dependent measurements reveal clear gate&#8208;controlled magnetotransport anisotropy, underscoring the strong coupling between gating, spin configuration, and transport behavior in MnBi2Te4.








Abstract
The intrinsic magnetic topological insulator MnBi2Te4 is a promising platform for exploring quantum phases with nontrivial band topology and for enabling electrical control over coupled magnetic and electronic phase transitions. In&#8208;plane magnetic fields, in particular, offer a distinct means of tuning these properties by strengthening quantized Hall effects, enhancing surface energy gaps, and driving spin reorientation transitions. However, a systematic understanding of how such fields affect magnetotransport is limited. Here, the magnetotransport behavior of few&#8208;layer MnBi2Te4 as a function of gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field angle, with a primary focus on in&#8208;plane field effects, are investigated. A gate&#8208;tunable crossover in magnetoresistance is observed from positive to negative values under in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as the gate voltage is swept below the charge neutrality point at temperatures below the N&#233;el temperature. The in&#8208;plane field drives a transition from the antiferromagnetic ground state to a ferromagnetic configuration with spins aligned in&#8208;plane, while simultaneously altering the electronic structure, as revealed by gate&#8208;dependent transport features. The angle&#8208;dependent measurements reveal strongly gate&#8208;tunable magnetotransport anisotropy. These results establish in&#8208;plane magnetic fields as an effective tuning parameter for modulating spin and charge transport in MnBi2Te4, advancing prospects for reconfigurable spintronic and topological devices.

         <title>Rhus Chinensis &#8208; Inspired Vertical Hierarchical Structure for Solar &#8208; Driven All &#8208; Weather Co &#8208; Harvesting of Fresh Water, Clean Salts, and Authigenic Electricity</title>

The unsatisfactory outdoor performance and potential contamination of recovered products limit the wider practical deployment of interfacial solar evaporators. In response, we develop a Rhus chinensis &#8208; inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity.








Abstract
The escalating challenges in water, energy, and environmental sustainability necessitate the efficient utilization of diverse water sources, such as seawater and wastewater. Herein, a Rhus chinensis &#8208;inspired vertical hierarchical structure (RVHS) is developed to achieve all &#8208; weather extraction of fresh water, clean salt, and authigenic electricity. The RVHS achieves high water production rates of 5.07&#160;kg m&#8722;2 during the day and 2.04&#160;kg m&#8722;2 at night, approximately 1.2 times and 1.8 times those of conventional ones, respectively, by strategically&#160;manipulating phase change material (PCM) and heat storage. Simultaneously, it enables an enhanced salt recovery of 2.24&#160;kg m&#8722;2, yielding purified salt free from detectable contaminants (such as microplastics and persistent organic pollutants), facilitated by a pollutant capture trap integrated into the RVHS, a feature rarely explored in prior research. Furthermore, during salt recovery, the optimized salt concentration gradient can be further utilized for energy harvesting with high power output through thermodynamic optimization, which is approximately 60% greater than traditional devices. Further performance improvements can be realized by optimizing thermodynamic structures or integrating higher &#8208; performance materials. In conclusion, this work offers a universal routine for solar &#8208; driven resource recovery from seawater.

         <title>HZO/HSO Superlattice ReFET Array Integrating Optical Sensing for Neuromorphic Vision Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic ReFET array with an engineered HZO&#8211;HSO superlattice enables monolithic integration of optical sensing, nonvolatile memory, and synaptic computation. It exhibits forming&#8208;free, &gt;8&#8208;bit analog states, &gt;1010 endurance cycles, and light&#8208;tunable conductance. Integrated into a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, it achieves 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST in an in&#8208;sensor vision transformer.








Abstract
Neuromorphic vision systems require artificial synapses that integrate sensing, memory, and computation with high precision and stability. Conventional memristors face limitations including forming requirements, few multilevel states, low endurance, and poor integration density, while ferroelectric and flash&#8208;based transistors suffer trade&#8208;offs among endurance, retention, and switching ratio, and generally lack intrinsic photonic sensitivity, constraining in&#8208;sensor computing. Here, a photonic resistive&#8208;gate field&#8208;effect transistor (ReFET) array is presented that combines optical sensing, forming&#8208;free multilevel memory, and analog computation in a single device. The ReFET employs a Hf0.5Zr0.5O2/Hf0.95Sr0.05O2 (HZO/HSO) superlattice gate and an amorphous InGaZnO (IGZO) channel, achieving 272 stable conductance states (&gt;8&#8208;bit) in a 20&#160;&#215;&#160;20 array, ON/OFF ratios &gt;10&#8310;, endurance &gt;1010 cycles, and retention &gt;10&#8310;&#160;s. The array functions as an in&#8208;sensor optical convolutional layer, performing multiply&#8211;accumulate (MAC) operations with 94.45% accuracy on Fashion&#8208;MNIST using 8&#8208;bit quantized weights, while delivering high energy efficiency. This platform enables scalable, high&#8208;precision, energy&#8208;efficient photonic neuromorphic computing, integrating sensing, memory, and computation in one architecture.

         <title>3D Photonic Metacrystals with Enhanced Collective Mie Resonances for Dual Structural Coloration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents high&#8208;quality 3D CdS metacrystals with long&#8208;range order that suppress radiation losses, yielding 13&#8208;fold enhanced magnetic Mie resonances (Q = 17) and dual nonfading structural coloration. &#160; Wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues F.








Abstract
3D photonic crystals offer nonfading structural coloration and complex optical properties through coupled Mie resonances in high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index materials. Although strong magnetic resonances make them promising, they often suffer from optical losses in the visible spectrum. Enhancing Mie resonances and quality factors through collective coupling in lithographically ordered arrays has been demonstrated. However, large&#8208;area applications using self&#8208;assembled colloidal resonators in metafluid inks have been limited by&#160;inadequate monodispersity and insufficient surface charge, hindering effective ordering. Here, we report high&#8208;quality 3D Mie&#8208;resonant metacrystals formed by high&#8208;temperature self&#8208;assembly of CdS nanoparticles (refractive index 2.5). Their long&#8208;range ordering attenuates local density of states overlapping with Mie resonances, minimizing external radiation losses and yielding&#160;one order of magnitude enhancement in collective Mie behavior. A 13&#8208;fold enhancement in magnetic Mie resonances with quality factors reaching 17 is experimentally demonstrated. The structures produce Bragg peaks that coexist with enhanced collective Mie resonances, enabling angle&#8208;dependent, dual nonfading structural coloration across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum. As a proof of concept, wafer&#8208;scale inkjet printing using metafluid inks of CdS and ZnS nanoparticles demonstrates stable coloration and angle&#8208;sensitive hues. This work opens new avenues in durable structural coloration and multifunctional optical platforms for applications such as ultrasensitive polarimetry and advanced optical sensing.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Resorbable Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bio&#8208;resorbable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) is presented that combine on&#8208;demand data erasure, transient functionality, and biocompatibility, making them suitable for secure, short&#8208;lived electronics. Through dissolution studies under physiological conditions, this is demonstrated that MTJ functionality can be removed within 10 h. Moreover, the bio&#8208;resorbable lifetime can be tuned by selecting appropriate materials and adjusting the layer thickness of individual layers.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) play a crucial role in spintronic applications, particularly data storage and sensors. Especially as a non&#8208;volatile memory, MTJs has received substantial attention due to its CMOS compatibility, low power consumption, fast switching speed, and high endurance. In parallel, bio&#8208;resorbable electronics have emerged as a promising solution for systems requiring temporary operation and secure data disposal, especially in military, intelligence, and biomedical systems where devices must safely disintegrate under physiological conditions. In this study, the bio&#8208;resorbability of MTJ is investigated by analyzing the dissolution behavior of its nanometer&#8208;thick constituent layers in phosphate&#8208;buffered saline solution at pH 7.4, simulating physiological environments. The MTJ structures, composed of bio&#8208;resorbable materials, exhibit well&#8208;controlled degradation behaviors. Critically, as one of the ferromagnetic layers dissolves, binary information is irreversibly lost, within 10 h of immersion. These findings highlight the potential of MTJs not only as high&#8208;performance memory elements but also as secure, transient data storage platforms. The ability to modify the dissolution lifetime by materials and thickness selection offers unique advantages for short&#8208;lived implantable devices, paving the way for integrating spintronic functionality into next&#8208;generation bioresorbable electronics.

         <title>Ce Single Atom&#8208;Engineered Amorphous/Crystalline Nanosheets for Enhanced Alkaline Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
We leveraged Ce single&#8208;atom engineering to generate short&#8208;range ordered crystalline nanodomains in amorphous RuOx for creating amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, in an effort to regulate the water dissociation kinetics for enhanced HER. Specifically, the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains greatly reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation and possess optimal free energy for H* adsorption, which collectively contributes to the enhanced HER performance.








Abstract
Designing nanocatalysts with fast water dissociation kinetics is key to achieving the industrial current density of the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) for green hydrogen production via water electrolysis, which remains a grand challenge. Here, leverage single&#8208;atom engineering,a Ce single&#8208;atom&#8208;doped amorphous RuOx nanosheet featuring abundant amorphous/crystalline nanojunctions, namely, ac&#8208;CeSARuOx is successfully developed. When employed as a catalyst for alkaline HER, the ac&#8208;CeSARuOx catalyst displays an overpotential of only 8.3 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope as low as 23.1&#160;mV dec&#8722;1, outperforming the Ru&#8208;based catalysts reported in recent studies. Anion exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) tests using ac&#8208;CeSARuOx as the cathode catalyst exhibit a low cell voltage of 1.71 V at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2, and the performance can be well maintained after 300 h. In situ spectroscopic analyses demonstrate the increased coverage of OH species on ac&#8208;CeSARuOx for enhanced water dissociation. Density function theory calculations suggest that the Ce&#8208;doped crystalline nanodomains in the amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunction could effectively reduce the energy barrier to water dissociation, while the Ce&#8208;doped amorphous constituents regulate the H* adsorption, which collectively boost the HER performance. This work offers a new strategy to create amorphous/nanocrystalline nanojunctions in nanocatalysts for enhanced electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Graphite Interlayers with Electron&#8208;Acceptor Bridges Raises Ion Diffusion Kinetics for Ultrafast Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present study systematically identifies and develops an electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride pre&#8208;intercalation graphite. The pre&#8208;intercalated graphite builds C&#9472;Cl&#9472;Al&#9472;C electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers, which facilitate charge transfer kinetics during lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and storage, thereby enabling fast&#8208;charging performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sluggish solid&#8208;state diffusion kinetics of lithium ions is among the primary bottlenecks limiting the fast&#8208;charging performance of graphite anodes. Pre&#8208;intercalating molecules in graphite interlayers can tune the valence &#960;&#8208;electrons, but there are few systematic studies in designing such structures by electron coupling to optimize the charge transfer kinetics. Herein, deliberately guided by simulations, the present study identifies and develops a class of electron&#8208;acceptor aluminum chloride species for intercalation into graphite (AC&#8208;G), aiming to accelerate lithium ions charge transfer to the intercalated graphite through the formation of electron&#8208;acceptor bridges within the graphite interlayers. Consequently, the AC&#8208;G achieves a two&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in lithium ions diffusion coefficient (5.85 &#215; 10&#8722;7 cm2 s&#8722;1) compared to that in pristine graphite. It delivers stable cycling over 2000 cycles with a high areal capacity retention of 3.84 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 1C and maintains 500&#8208;cycle stability at 5C. Furthermore, an Ah&#8208;level pouch cell assembled with AC&#8208;G and cathode achieves an energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 3C. The present work provides a new design strategy for graphite by introducing interlayer electron&#8208;bridging structures, offering valuable insights for next&#8208;generation fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries

         <title>De&#8208;Saturation of Single&#8208;Atom Copper Catalysts for Accelerating Propargylic Substitution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
De&#8208;saturation of copper&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalysts (De&#8208;sat SACs) are realized by a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock strategy. Benefiting from the under&#8208;saturation coordination environment of single&#8208;atom Cu center, De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates.








Abstract
Rational design of proximal coordination microenvironments surrounding catalytic sites to achieve optimal reaction kinetics represents a paramount pursuit in single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), yet continues to pose substantial synthetic challenges. Developing innovative strategies that simultaneously stabilize low&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;metal species on solid supports, while ensuring atomic precision and high activity, remains imperative. Herein, a de&#8208;saturation strategy for SACs is demonstrated (denoted as De&#8208;sat SACs) using a top&#8208;down approach based on a KOH&#8208;mediated Joule thermal shock to obtain under&#8208;coordinated and asymmetric SACs for efficient organic synthesis. Using copper&#8208;based SACs as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the de&#8208;saturation strategy effectively converts the CuN4 to CuN3 configuration. The De&#8208;sat Cu SACs exhibit remarkable catalytic activity in propargylic substitution reactions, tolerating a broad range of nucleophiles (N&#8211;, C&#8211;, and O&#8211;), as well as diverse aryl, alkyl, tertiary, and cyclic propargylic carbonates. The coordination reduction in these De&#8208;sat SACs not only breaks the structural symmetry to enhance site accessibility but also elevates the energy of the dz2${d}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital of Cu atom, thereby facilitating the formation of copper&#8211;alkynyl intermediates and boosting their catalytic performance. These findings establish a new platform for the rational design and synthesis of de&#8208;saturated yet stable SACs, facilitating challenging catalytic transformations toward sustainable chemical manufacturing.

         <title>Surface Energy&#8208;Confined Multi&#8208;Layer Inkjet Printing for Customizable Optical Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for customizable fabrication of 3D optical microstructures. By combining interfacial energy confinement with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer processing, various 3D curved optical microstructures with tailorable morphology, material composition, and spatial configuration are precisely fabricated and integrated, offering great promise for applications in miniaturized optical systems, multi&#8208;dimensional imaging, and high&#8208;security encryption.








Abstract
Inkjet printing emerges as a versatile on&#8208;demand patterning technique for additive manufacturing of optical microstructures, yet its ability to regulate the ink droplet morphology is constrained by the intrinsic interplay between ink&#8208;substrate wetting conditions, thereby hindering the customizable fabrication of 3D microstructures. Here, a surface energy&#8208;confined multi&#8208;layer inkjet printing strategy is developed for precisely fabricating curved optical microstructures with tunable size, solid angle, and configuration. The strategy is implemented through custom&#8208;engineered layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer printing on a pre&#8208;patterned substrate with spatially defined interfacial energy barriers, enabling the precise construction and integration of distinct optical microdomes (characterized by substrate attachment and uniform curved profiles) at the microscale. Notably, the strategy facilitates the high&#8208;throughput printing of diverse topological microdomes, ranging from triangular to hexagonal architectures. The as&#8208;fabricated microdomes, featuring precisely engineered morphology and sub&#8208;nanometer surface roughness, exhibit integrated light&#8208;field manipulation capabilities and unique multifocal characteristics, highlighting their potential for miniaturized optical systems and intelligent imaging devices. Beyond UV&#8208;cured polymers, this methodology is extendable to nanomaterial&#8208;based micro&#8208;3D printing (e.g., colloidal photonic crystal microdomes), opening avenues for more sophisticated optical functionalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, a non&#8208;imaging multidimensional encryption platform is printed leveraging 3D morphology&#8208;tailored optical readout.

The emerging galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronics for biomedical applications with passive and active control strategies are summarized. In addition, the challenges and opportunities for galvanic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Bioelectronic devices hold significant promise for advancing biomedical technologies, addressing critical healthcare challenges, and improving the quality of human life. Conventional bioelectronic devices are typically powered by external, bulky batteries connected by extended electrical wires, which limit the compactness and miniaturization of bioelectronics, restrict patient mobility, and increase the risk of complications such as infections and device&#8208;related failures. This perspective discusses the emerging concept of galvanic&#8208;cell&#8208;based self&#8208;powered bioelectronic devices, in which galvanic electrodes serve directly as the tissue&#8208;contacting interfaces. We provide an overview of the principles and working mechanisms of biocompatible galvanic cells in galvanic devices for diverse biomedical applications, including electrical modulation, chemical and biochemical modulation, and hybrid electrical/(bio)chemical modulation, along with their control strategies: passive control and active control. Furthermore, we envision that the advancement of galvanic devices will represent a promising direction for biomedical applications, despite the presence of inherent challenges.

         <title>Materials Design and Assessment of Redox&#8208;Mediated Flow Cell Systems for Enhanced Energy Storage and Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;mediated flow cells, which operate on an electrochemical&#8208;chemical cycle, shift desired reactions from electrode compartments to dedicated reactors and enable diversified applications for high&#8208;density flow batteries, fuel cells, CO2 capture, electrosynthesis, waste recycling, etc. This perspective outlines the material selection criteria, evaluation methods, and targeted design strategies toward next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The transition toward sustainable energy systems necessitates innovations that overcome the limitations of conventional electrochemical systems. Redox&#8208;mediated flow cell systems emerge as a transformative paradigm by decoupling energy storage, conversion, and chemical processes from traditional electrode&#8208;bound reactions. These systems employ soluble redox mediators to shuttle electrons between electrodes and spatially separated reactive phases (solid, liquid, or gas), thereby enabling unprecedented operational flexibility and scalability. This standpoint underscores the adaptability of redox&#8208;mediated electrified systems across a range of applications, encompassing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density redox targeting&#8208;based flow batteries, fuel cells, electrified CO2 capture, sustainable chemical synthesis, waste recycling, etc. The rational design of redox&#8208;active materials is central to their success, with precise alignment of redox potentials, enhanced electron&#8208;transfer kinetics, and robust stability underpinning performance. The challenges of new materials development, system durability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness can be addressed through advances in experimental measurement, computational modeling, operando characterization, and interdisciplinary collaboration. Moving forward, the integration of redox&#8208;mediated technologies with renewable energy systems and industrial processes is predicted to transform energy and chemical landscapes. The integration of laboratory innovations with real&#8208;world deployment facilitates a pathway to decarbonization, resource efficiency, and the circular economy. This perspective emphasizes the pivotal functions of redox&#8208;mediated architectures in fostering a robust, electrified future, where the convergence of energy storage, environmental stewardship, and sustainable chemical production is pivotal in addressing global challenges.

         <title>Precise Surface Engineering of Metal Nanoclusters: Ligand Programming for Functionality Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 50, December 17, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ligand programming offers a precise strategy to tune metal nanocluster surfaces at the atomic level. By controlling metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry, this approach enables customizable structures with enhanced catalytic, optical, and biomedical functions. This work highlights how precise surface engineering transforms metal nanoclusters into smart platforms for next&#8208;generation materials.








Abstract
Precise surface engineering of metal nanoclusters (MNCs) has emerged as a powerful strategy for tailoring their structural, electronic, and catalytic properties. On the basis of traditional surface chemistry, ligand programming enables atomic&#8208;level control over MNC functionality by modulating metal&#8208;ligand coordination, intra/inter&#8208;ligand interactions, and interfacial chemistry. These three layers within the &#8220;Engineering Zone&#8221; define structural flexibility, charge transfer pathways, molecular rigidity, and surface accessibility, key factors in optimizing catalytic activity, luminescence efficiency, and molecular recognition. This Perspective explores the chemistry governing ligand&#8208;directed MNC behavior in the three layers, highlighting its role in catalysis, photonics, and biomedicine. By integrating coordination chemistry, intra/inter&#8208;ligand design, and interfacial interactions, how ligand programming transforms MNCs is demonstrated into tunable platforms for next&#8208;generation functional materials. Insights from MNCs also provide a model for advancing surface engineering in broader nanomaterials, paving the way for innovative applications in materials science.

         <title>Engineering Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin Granules with High&#8208;Payload for Long&#8208;Acting Glycemic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study highlights the significant potential of high&#8208;payload, physiologically responsive delivery systems in diabetes management, which also offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;payload systems that dynamically respond to physiological fluctuations is crucial not only for improving the precision, safety, and efficacy of protein therapies but also for addressing biosafety concerns associated with carriers, reducing administration frequency, minimizing infection risks, and enhancing patient compliance. However, achieving precise control over protein release in the high&#8208;payload carriers remain a major challenge. In this study, a physiology&#8208;responsive, high&#8208;payload insulin (Ins) granule is engineered for long&#8208;term glucose management, using Ins as a model&#8212;an essential hormone that must be released in response to blood glucose changes for effective glycemic control in diabetic patients. The [(Ins&amp;GOx)@Zn]@[TA&amp;Fe] granules achieve an Ins loading capacity (LC%) exceeding 80%, significantly higher than the previously reported maximum of &#8776;40%. These granules extend the glucose&#8208;regulating effect of free Ins, typically limited to 3&#160;h, to 6&#160;days with a single injection, without any observed risk of hypoglycemia. Long&#8208;term administration (28&#160;days, 4 injection cycles, 7&#160;days&#160;injection&#8722;1) shows no significant physiological toxicity or immune response. This approach offers a promising strategy for developing intelligent, high&#8208;payload delivery systems for protein&#8208;based therapeutics, advancing more precise, safe, and patient&#8208;compliant treatments.

         <title>Potential in &#8220;Imperfection&#8221;: From Precise Construction to Electrocatalytic Enhancement of Vacancy Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article reviews the research progress of vacancies in electrocatalysis in recent years. It introduces the detection techniques and synthesis strategies of vacancies, discusses the catalytic functions of vacancies in typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms, elaborates on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between vacancies and catalytic performance, and provides theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering.








Abstract
Driven by the &#8220;dual carbon&#8221; strategic goals, electrocatalytic reactions have increasingly become a research frontier in the fields of energy and materials science due to their crucial role in the conversion of clean energy and environmental governance. Vacancy engineering has great potential in enhancing catalytic activity and selectivity. Systematically and deeply revealing the mechanism of vacancies in the electrocatalytic process has important value for achieving precise structural regulation and performance optimization of electrocatalysts. This work systematically reviews the research progress of vacancy modification electrocatalysts in recent years. The detection technology of vacancies is introduced, the synthetic strategies for vacancy construction are summarized, the catalytic functions of vacancies in various typical electrocatalytic reactions and their internal regulatory mechanisms are mainly discussed, and the regulatory effect of vacancies on the adsorption behavior of intermediates is analyzed. The structure&#8211;function relationship laws of factors such as vacancy type, concentration, and spatial distribution on catalytic performance are further summarized, providing theoretical support for the rational design of vacancy engineering. Finally, the future development direction of vacancy engineering is prospected, with the expectation of providing a theoretical basis and research ideas for constructing new electrocatalytic materials that are efficient, stable, and applicable on a large scale.

Flexible Integration Method for Flexible Electronics
In their Research Article (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202417590), Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, Tomoyuki Yokota, and co&#8208;workers present a novel hybrid direct bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives. This technique enables the connection of wiring and devices without increasing thickness, thereby providing high flexibility, mechanical robustness, and electrical conductivity required for integrated, flexible devices. Leveraging this method for flexible electronics integration promises the development of flexible stacked devices.

Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non&#8208;invasive, and non&#8208;destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non&#8208;resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PUF devices is examined using non&#8208;deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next&#8208;generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons. This has opened the path toward more powerful biomedical applications, including surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) and photothermal therapy (PTT). When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing. A comprehensive outlook on the evolution of plasmonic&#8208;based materials for the next therapies is provided.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Selective Lipolysis by Photoactivation of Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy Using Adipocyte Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticle in Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles loaded with rosiglitazone in hydrogel offer an alternative approach to conventional obesity treatments. This system selectively targets adipocytes, inducing lipolysis by activating chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy through mild photothermal stimulation. Demonstrating significant weight loss in animal models, this nanomaterial&#8208;based strategy holds promise for obesity management and other autophagy&#8208;related disorders.








Abstract
Despite the clinical importance of obesity, treatments have been confined to surgery or drugs, both of which carry adverse effects. Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP&#8208;H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP&#8208;H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed mice, ARNP&#8208;H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP&#8208;H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP&#8208;H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.

         <title>Wideband Tuning and Deep&#8208;Tissue Spectral Detection of Indium Phosphide Nano&#8208;Laser Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces indium phosphide (InP) nanolaser particles operating in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) spectrum, with ultrawide tunability (740&#8211;970&#160;nm) and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidths. Optimized for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and multiplexed barcoding, these particles offer excellent stability, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios in scattering media, and biocompatibility, making them highly promising for advanced biomedical research and applications.








Abstract
Laser particles (LPs) emitting narrowband spectra across wide spectral ranges are highly promising for high&#8208;multiplex optical barcoding of biological cells. Here, LPs based on indium phosphide (InP) nanodisks are presented, operating in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range of 740&#8211;970&#160;nm. Utilizing low&#8208;order whispering gallery resonance modes in size&#8208;tuned nanodisks, an ultrawide color palette with 25% spectral utilization and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidth is achieved. A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer&#8208;silica&#8208;protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon&#8208;detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios in highly&#8208;scattering media, including 1&#8208;cm&#8208;thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.

A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer-silica-protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon-detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal-to-background ratios in highly-scattering media, including 1-cm-thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.









Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision&#8208;based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Robust Full&#8208;Surface Bonding of Substrate and Electrode for Ultra&#8208;Flexible Sensor Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full&#8208;surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high&#8208;resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra&#8208;flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate&#8208;only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D&#8208;stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra&#8208;flexible electronics integration.

Upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework (UCNP&#8208;COF) core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi&#8208;spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP&#8208;COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP&#8208;COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP&#8208;COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real&#8208;time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high&#8208;performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

         <title>Multifunctional Photonic Nanomaterials and Devices for Digital Photomedicine via Neuro&#8208;Immune Cross&#8208;Talks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>

This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

It introduces fundamental components, discusses strategies for spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization in magnetic soft materials, and highlights representative applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced broadband photodetector technologies are essential for military and civilian applications. 2D semimetals, with their gapless band structures, high mobility, and topological protection, offer great promise for broadband PDs. This study reviews the latest advancements in broadband PDs utilizing heterostructures that combine 2D semimetals with materials of various dimensions and highlights their applications in optoelectronics.








Abstract
Hybrid heterostructures are pivotal in the advanced broadband detection technology. The emergence of 2D semimetals has expanded the range of materials in heterostructures beyond conventional narrow&#8208;gap materials for room&#8208;temperature broadband detection applications due to their extraordinary optical and electrical properties. This review outlines the cutting&#8208;edge and latest advancements in broadband photodetectors (PDs) engineered from heterostructures that synergistically combine 2D semimetals with several different dimensional materials. It begins with a fundamental investigation, offering an in&#8208;depth explanation of the essential material properties and a summary of synthesis methodologies. Then, the discussion advances to provide an analytical overview of the categorization, underlying photodetection mechanism, and figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit of these advanced PDs. Subsequently, the narrative shifts to a comprehensive analysis of heterogeneous integrated devices. The review further highlights the diverse optoelectronic applications of broadband PDs, spanning image sensing, optical communication, position&#8208;sensitive detection, integrated sensing and computing, spintronics, and computational spectroscopy are thoroughly highlighted. Finally, the review concludes by addressing the challenges and opportunities in advancing 2D semimetal materials for photodetection.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <dc:description>
Strategies achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are summarized and analyzed from both their separate advancements and the integrated effectiveness in this review. Then, perspectives are given for valuable guidance for further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs) are emerging as a promising energy storage technique supplementary to Li&#8208;ion batteries, attracting much research attention owing to their intrinsic safety, cost economy, and environmental friendliness. However, energy densities for AZIBs still do not fulfill practical requirements because of the low specific and areal capacity, limited working potential, and excessive negative&#8208;to&#8208;positive electrode capacity (N/P) ratio. In this review, a comprehensive overview of basic requirements and major challenges for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density AZIBs is provided. Following that, recent progress in the optimization of each component and the overall configuration is summarized, and crucial design principles are discussed. Apart from conventional emphasis on each part, especially cathode materials, separately, the comprehensive discussion about the synergistic interactions among all components is conducted. Finally, the outlook and research direction are given to provide valuable guidance for the further holistic development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

Abstract
Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.

         <title>Progress and Prospect for Conducting Polymer Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) are examined along five lines: classification based on raw materials, dispersion behaviors, fabrication methods, multilevel structure&#8208;performance correlations, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications as flexible and wearable electronics. A deep discussion on the dependence of overall performance on the multilevel structure is presented. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are discussed.








Abstract
The integration of plastic&#8208;like mechanical flexibility and metal&#8208;level electrical conductivity makes conducting polymer fibers (CPFs) find extensive uses, covering from lightweight conductors to wearable devices. Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes. Finally, existing challenges, possible solutions, and potential applications of CPFs are prospected. This review can provide helpful guidance for manufacturing ideally structured high&#8208;performance CPFs for advanced flexible electronics.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation.

     alt="Efficient Low-temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru-free Catalyst"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leveraging the strong metal-support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co-based catalyst are designed to enable low-temperature ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core-shell structure modulates &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-band center of Co, enhancing NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation and by-product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low-temperature NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt; core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru-based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Synchrotron X-ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X-ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co-core and BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;-overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&#8722;x&lt;/sub&gt;, which enhances NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption and facilitates the rate-determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal-support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low-temperature NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; cracking.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on.

&lt;p&gt;In the past few years, self-assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co-SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution-processable third-generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high-efficiency inverted PSCs, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole-selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non-radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so-called co-SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co-SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in-depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co-SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM-based HSLs in perovskite-based optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
