         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Optoelectronic Transistors for Bio&#8208;Inspired Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optoelectronic transistor with comprehensive visual functions is reported. By coupling photoreceptive properties of the IGZO channel and electrical regulation through charge injection/ferroelectric switching from the HZO gate, functions of photoreceptors in the retina and synapses in the visual cortex are achieved. This work provides a potential solution for developing compact and efficient devices for the next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;inspired visual system.








Abstract
Visual perception has profound effects on human decision&#8208;making and emotional responses. Replicating the functions of the human visual system through device development has been a constant pursuit in recent years. However, to fully simulate the various functions of the human visual system, it is often necessary to integrate multiple devices with different functions, resulting in complex, large&#8208;volume device structures and increased power consumption. Here, an optoelectronic transistor with comprehensive visual functions is introduced. By coupling diverse photoreceptive properties of the channel and electrical regulation through charge injection/ferroelectric switching from the hafnium&#8208;based gate, the devices can simulate functions of both photoreceptors in the retina and synapses in the visual cortex. A device array is constructed to confirm the perceptual functions of cone and rod cells. Subsequently, color discrimination and recognition for color images are achieved by combining the tunable perception and synapse functions. Then an intelligent traffic judgment system with this all&#8208;in&#8208;one device is developed, which is capable of making judgments and decisions regarding traffic signals and pedestrian movements. This work provides a potential solution for developing compact and efficient devices for the next&#8208;generation bio&#8208;inspired visual system.

         <title>Electrochemical Switching of Electromagnetism by Hierarchical Disorder Tailored Atomic Scale Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through electrochemically tailoring interfacial and cationic disordering, atomic electric fields are controllably coupled to form the local polarization domain, which eventually realizes superior electromagnetic tunability and dynamic switching between electromagnetic wave absorption/transparency.








Abstract
High&#8208;frequency electronic response governs a broad spectrum of electromagnetic applications from radiation protection, and signal compatibility, to energy recovery. Despite various efforts to manage electric conductivity, dynamic control over dielectric polarization for real&#8208;time electromagnetic modulation remains a notable challenge. Herein, an electrochemical lithiation&#8208;driven hierarchical disordering strategy is demonstrated for actively modulating electromagnetic properties. The controllable formation and diffusion of coherent interfaces and cation vacancies tailor the coupling of atomic electric field and thus the locally polarized domains, which leads to the reversible electromagnetic transparency/absorption switching with a tunable range of &#8722;0.8&#8211;&#8722;20.4 dB for the reflection loss and a broad operation bandwidth of 4.6 GHz. Compared to traditional methods of heteroatomic doping, hydrogenation, mechanical deformation, and phase transition, the electrochemical strategy shows a larger regulation scope of dielectric permittivity with the maximum increase ratios of 260% and 1950% for real and imaginary parts, respectively. This enables the construction of various device architectures including the adaptive window and pixelated metasurface. The results offer opportunities to achieve intelligent electromagnetic devices and pave an avenue to rejuvenate various electromagnetic functions of semiconductive oxides.

         <title>Enable Rechargeable Carbon Fluoride Batteries with Unprecedented High Rate and Long Life by Oxygen Doping and Electrolyte Formulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate (364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1), long life (600 cycles) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2 V by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. This Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates application potentiality in view of its low temperature operation, low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading.








Abstract
Here, a rechargeable carbon fluoride battery is demonstrated with unprecedented high rate and long life by oxygen doping and electrolyte formulation. The introductions of Mn2+&#8211;O catalyst and porous structure during the oxidation process of CFx cathode can promote the splitting of Li&#8211;F during charging. By further modulating the electrolyte with triphenylantimony chloride (TSbCl) as anion acceptor and CsF as product modulator, the more readily dissociable CsLiF2 product instead of LiF is preferentially formed, and the TSbCl&#8208;salt protection interface is constructed to confine Li&#8211;F based products and reduce fluoride loss at cathode side. These effects endow Li&#8208;CFx batteries with durable reversible conversion reaction (for at least 600 cycles), ultrahigh rate performance (e.g., 364 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 20 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and low charging plateau voltage down to 3.2&#160;V. The cathode exhibits the maximum power density of 38342&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1 and energy density of 1012&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1. Furthermore, this Li&#8208;CFx system demonstrates the promising prospects for applications in view of its low temperature operation (e.g., 280 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C), low self&#8208;discharge ability, large&#8208;scale pouch cell fabrication and high cathode loading (5&#8211;6&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2), enabling it to move beyond previous role as primary battery and into new role as fast&#8208;charging rechargeable battery with high energy density.

         <title>A NIR&#8208;II Organic Dendrimer with Superb Photothermal Performance Based on Electron&#8208;Donor Iteration for Photothermal Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under the electron&#8208;donor iteration strategy, the near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) absorbing&#160;organic photothermal dendrimer CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T nanoparticles (CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs) is for the first time designed to exhibit superb photothermal performance with the value (&#603;1064&#160;&#215;&#160;PTCE1064) of 2.85&#160;&#215;&#160;104 at 1064&#160;nm, offering a universal strategy to develop NIR&#8208;II organic small molecule photothermal materials for photothermal immunotherapy.








Abstract
Organic photothermal materials have attracted extensive attention due to their designable molecular structure, tunable excited&#8208;state properties, and excellent biocompatibility, however, the development of near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) absorbing&#160;organic photothermal materials with high photothermal conversion efficiency (PTCE) and molar extinction coefficient (&#603;) remains challenging. Herein, a novel &#8220;electron&#8208;donor iteration&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct organic photothermal dendrimers (CR&#8208;DPA&#8208;T, CR&#8208;(DPA)2&#8208;T and CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T) with donor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;acceptor&#8208;&#960;&#8208;donor (D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A&#8208;&#960;&#8208;D) features and diradical characteristics. Owing to the enhanced D&#8211;A effect and intramolecular motions, their absorption and photothermal capacity increase as the generation grows. Surprisingly, an excellent photothermal performance (&#603;1064 &#215;&#160;PTCE1064) with a superb value of 2.85&#160;&#215;&#160;104 in the NIR&#8208;II region is achieved for CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T nanoparticles (CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs) compared to most reported counterparts. Besides, CR&#8208;(DPA)3&#8208;T NPs exhibit superior antitumor efficacy by the synergistic effect of photothermal therapy (PTT)&#160;and immunotherapy, efficiently inhibiting the growth of both primary and distant tumors. To the best knowledge, organic photothermal dendrimer is for the first time reported, and a universal donor engineering strategy is offered to develop NIR&#8208;II&#8208;absorbing organic photothermal materials for photothermal immunotherapy.

         <title>Jamming Giant Molecules at Interface in Organic Photovoltaics to Improve Performance and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant molecule designated DQx&#8208;Ph is synthesized, characterized by a reduced Huang&#8208;Rhys parameter and suppressed non&#8208;radiative energy loss. Through the implementation of an interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabrication strategy, DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules are successfully jammed at the interface of donor and acceptor crystalline fibrils. This configuration preserves the superior transport properties of PM6 and L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage and thermodynamically stable characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Consequently, the organic photovoltaic device exhibits a high efficiency of 19.9%, along with improved operational stability.








Abstract
A novel approach for depositing the giant molecule acceptor (GMA) at the donor&#8211;acceptor interface to enhance the efficiency and stability of organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through a designed interface&#8208;enhanced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer device fabrication protocol is proposed. The giant molecule acceptor DQx&#8208;Ph is mixed with the polymer donor in the bottom layer to form a polymer donor fibril phase and a mixed phase, followed by subsequent deposition of the main acceptor L8&#8208;BO. The L8&#8208;BO solution swells the bottom layer and alters the localized morphology of the mixing phase, introducing L8&#8208;BO fibrillar crystallization and pushing DQx&#8208;Ph giant molecules outwards to the fibril interfaces. Through this approach, the localized morphology and optoelectronic property of the bulk heterojunction are optimized. This configuration maintains the superior transport properties of L8&#8208;BO while integrating the high open&#8208;circuit voltage characteristics of DQx&#8208;Ph. Additionally, exciton dissociation and charge generation are simultaneously enhanced, with suppressed energy losses. A power conversion efficiency of 19.9% with improved operational stability is achieved, underscoring the importance of GMA interface jamming in advancing OPV technology. This study provides new insights into the development of ancillary OPV materials to overcome the critical limitations in OPV, revealing innovative approaches for photovoltaic technologies.

This configuration preserves the superior transport properties of PM6 and L8-BO while integrating the high open-circuit voltage and thermodynamically stable characteristics of DQx-Ph.

         <title>Crosslinkable Ligands for High&#8208;Density Photo&#8208;Patterning of Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and synthesis of a bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for high&#8208;density photo&#8208;patterning of perovskite nanocrystals is reported. The incorporation of the photo&#8208;crosslinker to perovskite nanocrystals enables the creation of a high&#8208;density crosslinked film with high optical density of 1.1, at a film thickness of only 1.4 &#181;m. Patterning via laser writing gave well&#8208;defined patterns with feature sizes of 20 &#181;m.








Abstract
Perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs) are promising luminescent materials for electronic color displays due to their high luminescence efficiency, widely&#8208;tunable emission wavelengths, and narrow emission linewidth. Their application in emerging display technologies&#160;necessitates precise micron&#8208;scale patterning&#160;while maintaining good optical performance. Although photolithography is a well&#8208;established micro&#8208;patterning technique in the industry, conventional processes are incompatible with PNCs as the use of polar solvents can damage the ionic PNCs, causing&#160;severe luminescence quenching. Here,&#160;we report the rational design and synthesis of a new bidentate photo&#8208;crosslinkable ligand for the direct photo&#8208;patterning of PNCs. Each ligand contains two photosensitive acrylate groups and two carboxylate groups, and is introduced to the PNCs via an entropy&#8208;driven ligand exchange process. In a close&#8208;packed thin film, the acrylate ligands photo&#8208;polymerize and crosslink under ultraviolet light, rendering the PNCs insoluble in developing solvents. A high&#8208;density crosslinked PNC film with an optical density of 1.1 is attained at 1.4&#160;&#181;m thickness, surpassing industry requirements on the absorption coefficient. Micron&#8208;scale patterning is further demonstrated using direct laser writing, producing well&#8208;defined 20&#160;&#181;m features. This study thus offers an effective and versatile approach for micro&#8208;patterning PNCs, and may also be broadly applicable to other nanomaterial systems.

         <title>Switching from Molecules to Functional Materials: Breakthroughs in Photochromism With MOFs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uniting the innovative design strategies of reticular chemistry with photoresponsive moieties creates a synergistic relationship that elevates material performance and overcomes common challenges in functional material development. These advances can be realized using photochromic metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) as platforms, paving the way for breakthroughs in the areas of high&#8208;speed and programable optoelectronics, heterogeneous photocatalysis, and beyond.








Abstract
Photochromic materials with properties that can be dynamically tailored as a function of external stimuli are a rapidly expanding field driven by applications in areas ranging from molecular computing, nanotechnology, or photopharmacology to programable heterogeneous catalysis. Challenges arise, however, when translating the rapid, solution&#8208;like response of stimuli&#8208;responsive moieties to solid&#8208;state materials due to the intermolecular interactions imposed through close molecular packing in bulk solids. As a result, the integration of photochromic compounds into synthetically programable porous matrices, such as metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), has come to the forefront as an emerging strategy for photochromic material development. This review highlights how the core principles of reticular chemistry (on the example of MOFs) play a critical role in the photochromic material performance, surpassing the limitations previously observed in solution or solid state. The symbiotic relationship between photoresponsive compounds and porous frameworks with a focus on how reticular synthesis creates avenues toward tailorable photoisomerization kinetics, directional energy and charge transfer, switchable gas sorption, and synergistic chromophore communication is discussed. This review not only focuses on the recent cutting&#8208;edge advancements in photochromic material development, but also highlights novel, vital&#8208;to&#8208;pursue pathways for multifaceted functional materials in the realms of energy, technology, and biomedicine.

         <title>Achieving Efficient X&#8208;ray Scintillation of Purely Organic Phosphorescent Materials by Chromophore Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of rigid and flexible is proposed host&#8208;guest doping strategies to achieve efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillation. Under UV&#8208;light excitation, the phosphorescence efficiency of the doped crystal reaches up to 99.4%. Compared with single&#8208;component crystals, the doped crystals display markedly enhanced radioluminescence because of the confinement of isolated chromophores and the effective harvesting of triplet excitons, which benefits potential applications in X&#8208;ray radiography.








Abstract
Scintillators have attracted significant attention due to their wide&#8208;ranging applications in both industrial and medical fields. However, one of the ongoing challenges is the efficient utilization of triplet excitons to achieve high radioluminescence efficiency. Here, a series of purely organic phosphors is presented for X&#8208;ray scintillation, employing a combined rigid and flexible host&#8208;guest doping strategy. The doped crystals exhibit a remarkable maximum phosphorescence efficiency of 99.4% under UV excitation. Furthermore, upon X&#8208;ray irradiation, the radioluminescence intensities of the doped phosphors are markedly higher compared to their single&#8208;component crystal counterparts. Through systematic investigations, it is demonstrated the crucial role of confining isolated chromophores in enhancing scintillation efficiency. Additionally, a transparent scintillator screen fabricated with the doped phosphor exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray imaging performance, achieving a high spatial resolution of 18.0 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1. This work not only offers valuable insights into suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions of triplet excitons during scintillation but also opens a new avenue for designing highly efficient purely organic phosphorescent scintillators.

         <title>Zinc Chemistries of Hybrid Electrolytes in Zinc Metal Batteries: From Solvent Structure to Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The microscopic solvent structures, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in hybrid electrolytes, which consist of aqueous solution, multiple ions, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent, are systematically elaborated and reviewed. The scotoma and amelioration strategies for designing current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited as well.








Abstract
Along with the booming research on zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) in recent years, operational issues originated from inferior interfacial reversibility have become inevitable. Presently, single&#8208;component electrolytes represented by aqueous solution, &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent system are hard to undertake independently the task of guiding the practical application of ZMBs due to their specific limitations. The hybrid electrolytes modulate microscopic interaction mode between Zn2+ and other ions/molecules, integrating vantage of respective electrolyte systems. They even demonstrate original Zn2+ mobility pattern or interfacial chemistries mechanism distinct from single&#8208;component electrolytes, providing considerable opportunities for solving electromigration and interfacial problems in ZMBs. Therefore, it is urgent to comprehensively summarize the zinc chemistries principles, characteristics, and applications of various hybrid electrolytes employed in ZMBs. This review begins with elucidating the chemical bonding mode of Zn2+ and interfacial physicochemical theory, and then systematically elaborates the microscopic solvent structure, Zn2+ migration forms, physicochemical properties, and the zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in each type of hybrid electrolytes. Among of which, the scotoma and amelioration strategies for the current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited, expecting to provide referenceable insights for further progress of future high&#8208;quality ZMBs.

&lt;p&gt;The microscopic solvent structures, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration forms, physicochemical properties, and zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in hybrid electrolytes, which consist of aqueous solution, multiple ions, &#8220;water-in-salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent, are systematically elaborated and reviewed. The scotoma and amelioration strategies for designing current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited as well.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Along with the booming research on zinc metal batteries (ZMBs) in recent years, operational issues originated from inferior interfacial reversibility have become inevitable. Presently, single-component electrolytes represented by aqueous solution, &#8220;water-in-salt,&#8221; solid, eutectic, ionic liquids, hydrogel, or organic solvent system are hard to undertake independently the task of guiding the practical application of ZMBs due to their specific limitations. The hybrid electrolytes modulate microscopic interaction mode between Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and other ions/molecules, integrating vantage of respective electrolyte systems. They even demonstrate original Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; mobility pattern or interfacial chemistries mechanism distinct from single-component electrolytes, providing considerable opportunities for solving electromigration and interfacial problems in ZMBs. Therefore, it is urgent to comprehensively summarize the zinc chemistries principles, characteristics, and applications of various hybrid electrolytes employed in ZMBs. This review begins with elucidating the chemical bonding mode of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and interfacial physicochemical theory, and then systematically elaborates the microscopic solvent structure, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; migration forms, physicochemical properties, and the zinc chemistries mechanisms at the anode/cathode interfaces in each type of hybrid electrolytes. Among of which, the scotoma and amelioration strategies for the current hybrid electrolytes are actively exposited, expecting to provide referenceable insights for further progress of future high-quality ZMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Dynamic H&#8208;Bonding Network Enables Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Color&#8208;Tunable Chiral Afterglow Polymer for 4D Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy utilizing dynamic H&#8208;bonding networks is proposed to create stimuli&#8208;responsive, color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials, offering precise control over both color and lifetime. These materials pave the way for the development of advanced optical information displays and sophisticated 4D encryption systems, significantly enhancing the functionality and adaptability of optoelectronic information systems.








Abstract
The development of stimuli&#8208;responsive and color&#8208;tunable chiral organic afterglow materials has attracted great attention but remains a daunting challenge. Here, a simple yet effective strategy through the construction of a dynamic H&#8208;bonding network is proposed to explore the multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow by doping a self&#8208;designed chiral phosphorescent chromophore into a polyvinyl alcohol matrix. A stimuli&#8208;responsive deep blue chiral afterglow system with a lifetime of up to 3.35 s, quantum yield of 25.0%, and luminescent dissymmetry factor of up to 0.05 is achieved through reversible formation and breakdown of the H&#8208;bonding network upon thermal&#8208;heating and water&#8208;fumigating. Moreover, multi&#8208;color stimuli&#8208;responsive chiral afterglow can be obtained by chiral and afterglow energy transfer, allowing the establishment of afterglow information displays and high&#8208;level 4D encryption. This work not only offers a facile platform to develop advanced stimuli&#8208;responsive materials but also opens a new avenue for developing next&#8208;generation optical information technology with enhanced functionality and responsiveness.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven, Reversible Spatiotemporal Control of Dynamic Covalent Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is utilized for the reversible spatiotemporal activation of dynamic bond exchange in a covalently cross&#8208;linked polymer. The reorganization rate of the network structure is controlled by the exposure to UV or visible light, which enables advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps.








Abstract
Dynamic covalent polymer networks exhibit a cross&#8208;linked structure like conventional thermosets and elastomers, although their topology can be reorganized through externally triggered bond exchange reactions. This characteristic enables a unique combination of repairability, recyclability and dimensional stability, crucial for a sustainable industrial economy. Herein the application of a photoswitchable nitrogen superbase is reported for the spatially resolved and reversible control over dynamic bond exchange within a thiol&#8208;ene photopolymer. By the exposure to UV or visible light, the associative exchange between thioester links and thiol groups is successfully gained control over, and thereby the macroscopic mechanical material properties, in a locally controlled manner. Consequently, the resulting reorganization of the global network topology enables to utilize this material for previously unrealizable advanced applications such as spatially resolved, reversible reshaping as well as micro&#8208;imprinting over multiple steps. Finally, the presented concept contributes fundamentally to the evolution of dynamic polymers and provides universal applicability in covalent adaptable networks relying on a base&#8208;catalyzed exchange mechanism.

         <title>Asymmetrically Coordinated Cu Dual&#8208;Atom&#8208;Sites Enables Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual&#8208;atom sites with CuN2&#8208;CuNS moiety exhibits excellent electrocatalytic CO2RR performances. The asymmetrical electron cloud distribution around the CuN2&#8208;CuNS of the asymmetrically coordinated Cu dual&#8208;atom catalyst destabilizes the ethylene reaction intermediates and thereby promotes ethanol production.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 (CO2RR) to value&#8208;added liquid fuels is a highly attractive solution for carbon&#8208;neutral recycling, especially for C2+ products. However, the selectivity control to preferable products is a great challenge due to the complex multi&#8208;electron proton transfer process. In this work, a series of Cu atomic dispersed catalysts are synthesized by regulating the coordination structures to optimize the CO2RR selectivity. Cu2&#8208;SNC catalyst with a uniquely asymmetrical coordinated CuN2&#8208;CuNS site shows high ethanol selective with the FE of 62.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE and 60.2% at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE in H&#8208;Cell and Flow&#8208;Cell test, respectively. Besides, the nest&#8208;like structure of Cu2&#8208;SNC is beneficial to the mass transfer process and the selection of catalytic products. In situ experiments and theory calculations reveal the reaction mechanisms of such high selectivity of ethanol. The S atoms weaken the bonding ability of the adjacent Cu to the carbon atom, which accelerates the selection from *CHCOH to generate *CHCHOH, resulting in the high selectivity of ethanol. This work indicates a promising strategy in the rational design of asymmetrically coordinated single, dual, or tri&#8208;atom catalysts and provides a candidate material for CO2RR to produce ethanol.

         <title>A Robust Core&#8208;Shell Nanofabric with Personal Protection, Health Monitoring and Physical Comfort for Smart Sportswear</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

This work proposed a strategy to seamlessly integrate the essential functions of multiple sensory, heat regulation, and impact protection into a thin, soft, lightweight, non&#8208;woven textile for smart sportswear via facile coaxial electrospinning technology.








Abstract
Smart textiles with a high level of personal protection, health monitoring, physical comfort, and wearing durability are highly demanded in clothing for harsh application scenarios, such as modern sportswear. However, seamlessly integrating such a smart clothing system has been a long&#8208;sought but challenging goal. Herein, based on coaxial electrospinning techniques, a smart non&#8208;woven textile (Smart&#8208;NT) integrated with high impact resistance is developed, multisensory functions, and radiative cooling effects. This Smart&#8208;NT is comprised of core&#8208;shell nanofibers with an ionic conductive polymer sheath and an impact&#8208;stiffening polymer core. The soft smart textile, with a thickness of only 800&#160;&#181;m, can attenuate over 60% of impact force, sense pressure stimulus with sensitivity up to 201.5 kPa&#8722;1, achieve temperature sensing resolution of 0.1&#160;&#176;C, and reduce skin temperature by &#8776;17&#160;&#176;C under a solar intensity of 1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2. In addition, the stretchable Smart&#8208;NT is highly durable and robust, retaining its multifunction features over 10&#160;000 bending and multiple washing cycles. Finally, application scenarios are demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring, body protection, and physical comfort of smart sportswear based on Smart&#8208;NT for outdoor sports. The strategy opens a new avenue for seamless integration of smart clothing systems.

         <title>Blueprints of Architected Materials: A Guide to Metamaterial Design for Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical metamaterials are architected structures with extraordinary properties, which are defined by their unit cell geometry. Although metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering, their complex design limits their wider use. This review acts as a guide detailing design principles and geometric parameters crucial for metamaterial design, while showcasing applications in tissue engineering, to facilitate metamaterial use in the field.








Abstract
Mechanical metamaterials are rationally designed structures engineered to exhibit extraordinary properties, often surpassing those of their constituent materials.

&lt;p&gt;Mechanical metamaterials are rationally designed structures engineered to exhibit extraordinary properties, often surpassing those of their constituent materials. The geometry of metamaterials&#8217; building blocks, referred to as unit cells, plays an essential role in determining their macroscopic mechanical behavior. Due to their hierarchical design and remarkable properties, metamaterials hold significant potential for tissue engineering; however their implementation in the field remains limited. The major challenge hindering the broader use of metamaterials lies in the complexity of unit cell design and fabrication.

The essential unit cell geometric parameters and design constraints, as well as their influence on mechanical behavior, are summarized highlighting essential points for effective fabrication. Moreover, the potential integration of artificial intelligence techniques is explored in meta-biomaterial design for patient- and application-specific design. Furthermore, a comprehensive overview of current applications of mechanical metamaterials is provided in tissue engineering, categorized by tissue type, thereby showcasing the versatility of different designs in matching the mechanical properties of the target tissue.

         <title>NIR&#8208;Actuated Ferroptosis Nanomotor for Enhanced Tumor Penetration and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying Z@P&#8208;F nanomotor with efficient lysosome escape and enhanced tumor penetration is successfully developed for synergistic tumor CDT/PTT. By releasing Fe2+ and H2O2 under NIR irradiation and acidic TME, Z@P&#8208;F nanomotors continuously generate large amounts of lipid ROS in the tumor and deplete intracellular GSH, thus facilitating Fe2+&#8208;mediated ferroptosis and eventually achieving effective tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ferroptosis nano&#8208;inducers have drawn considerable attention in the treatment of malignant tumors. However, low intratumoral hydrogen peroxide level and complex biological barriers hinder the ability of nanomedicines to generate sufficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve tumor penetration. Here a near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;driven ROS self&#8208;supplying nanomotor is successfully designed for synergistic tumor chemodynamic therapy (CDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT). Janus nanomotor is created by the asymmetrical modification of polydopamine (PDA) with zinc peroxide (ZnO2) and subsequent ferrous ion (Fe2+) chelation via the polyphenol groups from the PDA, here refer as ZnO2@PDA&#8208;Fe (Z@P&#8208;F). ZnO2 is capable of slowly releasing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into an acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) providing sufficient ingredients for the Fenton reaction necessary for ferroptosis. Upon NIR laser irradiation, the loaded Fe2+ is released and a thermal gradient is simultaneously formed owing to the asymmetric PDA coating, thus endowing the nanomotor with self&#8208;thermophoresis based enhanced diffusion for subsequent lysosomal escape and tumor penetration. Therefore, the release of ferrous ions (Fe2+), self&#8208;supplied H2O2, and self&#8208;thermophoresis of nanomotors with NIR actuation further improve the synergistic CDT/PTT efficacy, showing great potential for active tumor therapy.

         <title>Indirect&#8208;To&#8208;Direct Bandgap Crossover and Room&#8208;Temperature Valley Polarization of Multilayer MoS2 Achieved by Electrochemical Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study demonstrates highly electron&#8208;doped multi&#8208;monolayer 2H&#8208;MoS2&#160;through planar organic ion intercalation (1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium, EMIM+),&#160;maintaining a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence intensity, and stable valley polarization up to room temperature for future applications of valleytronics and spintronics.








Abstract
Monolayer (1L) group VI transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibit broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, offering promising applications in optoelectronics and valleytronics. Despite their direct bandgap, high absorption coefficient, and spin&#8208;valley locking in K or K&#8217; valleys, the ultra&#8208;short valley lifetime limits their room&#8208;temperature applications. In contrast, multilayer TMDs, with more absorptive layers, sacrifice the direct bandgap and valley polarization upon gaining inversion symmetry from the bilayer structure. It is demonstrated that multilayer molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) can maintain 1) a structure with broken inversion symmetry and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, 2) a direct bandgap with high photoluminescence (PL) intensity, and 3) stable valley polarization up to room temperature. Through the intercalation of organic 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium (EMIM+) ions, multilayer MoS2 not only exhibits layer decoupling but also benefits from an electron doping effect. This results in a hundredfold increase in PL intensity and stable valley polarization, achieving 55% and 16% degrees of valley polarization at 3 K and room temperature, respectively. The persistent valley polarization at room temperature, due to interlayer decoupling and trion dominance facilitated by a gate&#8208;free method, opens up potential applications in valley&#8208;selective optoelectronics and valley transistors.

         <title>Microenvironment&#8208;Activatable Probe for Precise NIR&#8208;II Monitoring and Synergistic Immunotherapy in Rheumatoid Arthritis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced nanoprobe that integrates activatable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging for precise rheumatoid arthritis (RA) diagnosis with multi&#8208;pronged RA treatments is developed. It enables highly sensitive RA diagnosis and real&#8208;time therapeutic monitoring. And the combination of ROS scavenging, on&#8208;demand CO gas release, and IL&#8208;6 signaling blockade results in synergistic immunomodulation effect, significantly alleviating RA symptoms and preventing joint destruction.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) represents an insidious autoimmune inflammatory disorder that severely lowers the life quality by progressively destructing joint functions and eventually causing permanent disability, posing a serious public health problem. Here, an advanced theranostic probe is introduced that integrates activatable second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence imaging for precise RA diagnosis with multi&#8208;pronged RA treatments. A novel molecular probe comprising a long&#8208;wavelength aggregation&#8208;induced emission unit and a manganese carbonyl cage motif is synthesized, which enables NIR&#8208;II fluorescence activation and concurrently releasing therapeutic carbon monoxide (CO) gas in inflamed joint microenvironment. This molecular probe self&#8208;assembles into a biocompatible nanoprobe, which is subsequently conjugated with anti&#8208;IL&#8208;6R antibody to afford active&#8208;targeting ability of RA. The nanoprobe exhibits significant turn&#8208;on NIR&#8208;II fluorescence signal at the RA lesion, enabling highly sensitive RA diagnosis and real&#8208;time therapeutic monitoring. The combination of ROS scavenging, on&#8208;demand CO gas release, and IL&#8208;6 signaling blockade results in potent therapeutic effect and synergistic immunomodulation impact, significantly alleviating the RA symptoms and preventing joint destruction. This research introduces a novel paradigm for the development of high&#8208;performance, activatable theranostic strategies to facilitate precise detection and enhanced treatment of RA&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Rationally Designed Mo/Ru&#8208;Based Multi&#8208;Site Heterogeneous Electrocatalyst for Accelerated Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rationally designed Mo/Ru&#8208;based multi&#8208;site electrocatalyst enables ampere&#8208;level current density alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction under low overpotential. Rationally modulating the separate functions endows the higher valence state of interfacial Mo (MoO2) coupled with the lower valence state of interfacial Mo (Mo2C) for accelerating H2O dissociation, and the interfacial Ru for promoted H&#8211;H coupling and subsequent H2 evolution.








Abstract
The rational design of multi&#8208;site electrocatalysts with three different functions for facile H2O dissociation, H&#8211;H coupling, and rapid H2 release is desirable but difficult to achieve. This strategy can accelerate the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under alkaline conditions. To resolve this issue, a Mo/Ru&#8208;based catalyst with three different active sites (Ru/Mo2C/MoO2) is rationally designed and its performance in alkaline HER is evaluated. The experimental results and density functional theory calculations revealed that, at the heterogeneous Mo2C/MoO2 interface, the higher valence state of Mo (MoO2) and the lower valence state of Mo (Mo2C) exhibited strong OH&#8722; and H&#8722;binding energies, respectively, which accelerated H2O dissociation. Moreover, the interfacial Ru possessed an appropriate hydrogen binding energy for H&#8211;H coupling and subsequent H2 evolution. Thus, this catalyst significantly accelerated the Volmer step and the Tafel step and, consequently, HER kinetics. This catalyst also demonstrated low overpotentials of 19 and 160&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, in alkaline media and long&#8208;term stability superior to that of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art alkaline HER electrocatalysts. This work provides a rational design principle for advanced multi&#8208;site catalytic systems, which can realize multi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic reactions.

Moreover, the interfacial Ru possessed an appropriate hydrogen binding energy for H&#8211;H coupling and subsequent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution. Thus, this catalyst significantly accelerated the Volmer step and the Tafel step and, consequently, HER kinetics. This catalyst also demonstrated low overpotentials of 19 and 160&#160;mV at current densities of 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively, in alkaline media and long-term stability superior to that of most state-of-the-art alkaline HER electrocatalysts. This work provides a rational design principle for advanced multi-site catalytic systems, which can realize multi-electron electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Ionic Co&#8208;Crystals for Fast Solid&#8208;State Zinc Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogen&#8208;bonded ionic co&#8208;crystal (HIC) solid electrolyte is developed with a grain boundary&#8208;based ion transport mechanism showing extraordinarily high ionic conductivity and improved interfacial contact.








Abstract
The development of new ionic conductors meeting the requirements of current solid&#8208;state devices is imminent but still challenging. Hydrogen&#8208;bonded ionic co&#8208;crystals (HICs) are multi&#8208;component crystals based on hydrogen bonding and Coulombic interactions. Due to the hydrogen bond network and unique features of ionic crystals, HICs have flexible skeletons. More importantly, anion vacancies on their surface can potentially help dissociate and adsorb excess anions, forming cation transport channels at grain boundaries. Here, it is demonstrated that a HIC optimized by adjusting the ratio of zinc salt and imidazole can construct grain boundary&#8208;based fast Zn2+ transport channels. The as&#8208;obtained HIC solid electrolyte possesses an unprecedentedly high ionic conductivity at room and low temperatures (&#8776;11.2 mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C and &#8776;2.78&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C) with ultra&#8208;low activation energy (&#8776;0.12&#160;eV), while restraining dendrite growth and exhibiting low overpotential even at a high current density (&lt;200&#160;mV at 5.0&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) during Zn symmetric cell cycling. This HIC also allows solid&#8208;state Zn||covalent organic framework full cells to work at low temperatures, providing superior stability. More importantly, the HIC can even support zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors to work, achieving extraordinary rate capability and a power density comparable to aqueous solution&#8208;based supercapacitors. This work provides a path for designing facilely prepared, low&#8208;cost, and environmentally friendly ionic conductors with extremely high ionic conductivity and excellent interface compatibility.

         <title>Anode&#8208;Free Li Metal Batteries: Feasibility Analysis and Practical Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs), with lithiated cathodes, offer theoretical max energy density but suffer from poor deposition efficiency, active material loss, crosstalk and volume change. This study reviews progress in AFLMBs, analyzing their performance and challenges. Strategies for addressing deposition issues and enhancing battery components are presented, with a vision for their future applications.








Abstract
Energy storage devices are striving to achieve high energy density, long lifespan, and enhanced safety. In view of the current popular lithiated cathode, anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries (AFLMBs) will deliver the theoretical maximum energy density among all the battery chemistries. However, AFLMBs face challenges such as low plating&#8208;stripping efficiency, significant volume change, and severe Li&#8208;dendrite growth, which negatively impact their lifespan and safety. This study provides an overview and analysis of recent progress in electrode structure, characterization, performance, and practical challenges of AFLMBs. The deposition behavior of lithium is categorized into two stages: heterogeneous and homogeneous interface deposition. The feasibility and practical application value of AFLMBs are critically evaluated. Additionally, key test models, evaluation parameters, and advanced characterization techniques are discussed. Importantly, practical strategies of different battery components in AFLMBs, including current collector, interface layer, solid&#8208;state electrolyte, liquid&#8208;state electrolyte, cathode, and cycling protocol, are presented to address the challenges posed by the two types of deposition processes, lithium loss, crosstalk effect and volume change. Finally, the application prospects of AFLMBs are envisioned, with a focus on overcoming the current limitations and unlocking their full potential as high&#8208;performance energy storage solutions.

         <title>Picometer&#8208;Level In Situ Manipulation of Ferroelectric Polarization in Van der Waals layered InSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced in situ biasing and atomic&#8208;scale imaging in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope are employed to investigate and manipulate in real space local picometer&#8208;level structure variations and polarization in a prototype 2D vdW ferroelectrics InSe. Intralayer sliding within each Se&#8211;In&#8211;In&#8211;Se quadruple&#8208;layer is identified to be responsible for switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization and ferroelectricity of InSe.








Abstract
Ferroelectric 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered materials are attracting increasing attention due to their potential applications in next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics and in&#8208;memory computing with polarization&#8208;dependent functionalities. Despite the critical role of polarization in governing ferroelectricity behaviors, its origin and relation with local structures in 2D vdW layered materials have not been fully elucidated so far. Here, intralayer sliding of approximately six degrees within each quadruple&#8208;layer of the prototype 2D vdW ferroelectrics InSe is directly observed and manipulated using sub&#8208;angstrom resolution imaging and in situ biasing in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. The in situ electric manipulation further indicates that the reversal of intralayer sliding can be achieved by altering the electric field direction. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the reversible picometer&#8208;level intralayer sliding is responsible for switchable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. The observation and manipulation of intralayer sliding demonstrate the structural origin of ferroelectricity in InSe and establish a dynamic structural variation model for future investigations on more 2D ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Intertwined Flexoelectricity and Stacking Ferroelectricity in Marginally Twisted hBN Moir&#233; Superlattice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In marginally twisted hBN homojunction that form moir&#233; ferroelectric patterns, the lattice&#8208;mismatching induced flexoelectric effect can shape the domains to hollow triangular structures, while domains can be also modulated by natural bubbles and externally applied forces, demonstrating a new tuning knob to manipulate the moir&#233; ferroelectricity.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices in twisted van der Waals homo/heterostructures present a fascinating interplay between electronic and atomic structures, with potential applications in electronic and optoelectronic devices. Flexoelectricity, an electromechanical coupling between electric polarization and strain gradient, is intrinsic to these superlattices because of the lattice misfit strain at the atomic scale. However, due to its weak magnitude, the effect of flexoelectricity on moir&#233; ferroelectricity has remained underexplored. Here, the role of flexoelectricity in shaping and modulating the moir&#233; ferroelectric patterns in twisted hBN homojunction is unveiled. Enhanced flexoelectric effects induce unique stacking ferroelectric domains with hollow triangular structures. Interlayer bubbles influence domain shape and periodicity through local electric field modulation, and tip&#8208;stress enables the reversible manipulation of domain area and polarization direction. These findings highlight the impact of flexoelectric effects on moir&#233; ferroelectricity, offering a new tuning knob for its manipulation.

         <title>Cu&#8208;Atom Locations in Rocksalt SnTe Thermoelectric Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through transmission electron microscopy and statistical image processing, Cu&#8208;atom locations in a Cu&#8208;doped SnTe rocksalt alloy are investigated to explain its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity for efficient thermoelectric energy production. This study offers atomic&#8208;scale insights for achieving more precise dopant engineering, leading to the accelerated development of functional thermoelectric materials.








Abstract
The development of functional thermoelectric materials requires direct evidence of dopants&#8217; locations to rationally design the electronic and phononic structure of the host matrix. In this study, Cs&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy is employed at the atomic scale to identify Cu atoms&#8217; locations in a Cu&#8208;doped SnTe thermoelectric alloy.

&lt;p&gt;Through transmission electron microscopy and statistical image processing, Cu-atom locations in a Cu-doped SnTe rocksalt alloy are investigated to explain its ultralow lattice thermal conductivity for efficient thermoelectric energy production. This study offers atomic-scale insights for achieving more precise dopant engineering, leading to the accelerated development of functional thermoelectric materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of functional thermoelectric materials requires direct evidence of dopants&#8217; locations to rationally design the electronic and phononic structure of the host matrix. In this study, Cs-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy is employed at the atomic scale to identify Cu atoms&#8217; locations in a Cu-doped SnTe thermoelectric alloy. It is revealed that Cu atoms in the rocksalt SnTe form solid solutions at both Sn and Te sites, contrary to their electronegativity order and the intentional Cu doping at Sn sites. Cu atoms are also located at the tetrahedral and crowdion sites of the face-centred cubic structure, with varying degrees of correlations. Such high flexibility of Cu atoms in the rocksalt SnTe offers diverse phonon-scattering mechanisms conducive to the ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity of singly Cu-doped SnTe. This study offers atomic-scale insights for achieving more precise dopant engineering, leading to the accelerated development of functional thermoelectric materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Crystal Polarization Tuning Bulk Charge and Single&#8208;Site Chemical State for Exceptional Hydrogen Photo&#8208;Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oriented crystal polarization of CdS nanorods enables a strong electric field (20.1&#8208;fold enhancement), which results in a ultrahigh bulk charge separation efficiency of 72.4% and activates Pt monatomic sites via increasing onsite electron density, rendering exceptional photocatalytic H2 evolution activities with a rate of 118.5 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) at 420 nm of 57.7%, and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 57798.4 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
Rapid bulk charge recombination and mediocre surface catalytic sites harshly restrict the photocatalytic activities. Herein, the aforementioned concerns are well addressed by coupling macroscopic spontaneous polarization and atomic&#8208;site engineering of CdS single&#8208;crystal nanorods for superb H2 photo&#8208;production. The oriented growth of CdS nanorods along the polar axis, vectorially superimposing substantial polar units with orderly arrangement, renders a strong polarization electric field (20.1 times enhancement), which boosts bulk charge separation with an efficiency up to 72.4% (80.4&#8208;fold). Remarkably, polarization electric field alters the chemical state of Pt single sites by orderly reducing the binding energy of Pt atom with stepwise polarization enhancement of CdS substrate, which increases the onsite electron density of Pt from 10.232 to 10.261e&#8722; and *H key intermediates, providing preponderant Volmer&#8208;Tafel/Volmer&#8208;Heyrovsky reaction pathways with significantly decreased energy barriers for H2 production. Thus, highly polarized CdS nanorods with atomically dispersed Pt sites perform an outstanding H2 space&#8208;time yield of 118.5&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and apparent quantum efficiency of 57.7% at &#955; = 420&#160;nm, and a record&#8208;high H2 turnover frequency of 57798.4 h&#8722;1, being one of the best catalysts for photocatalytic H2 evolution. This work highlights the function of polarization in manipulating charge separation and catalytic reaction.

MXene/PVA/PAA&#8208;Hanji (MPP&#8208;H) composites are devised as multifunctional textiles. Energy harvesting function generates electrical power using human sweat and environmental humidity, while asymmetric features of MPP&#8208;H textiles enable superior electromagnetic interference shielding through absorption&#8208;driven mechanisms. Thermo&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical robustness of the MPP&#8208;H is demonstrated by superior flame resistance to protect the human body, rapid Joule heating capability for thermoregulation, and high durability with flexibility and washability.








Abstract
The rapid development of wearable electronics, personal mobile equipment, and Internet of Things systems demands smart textiles that integrate multiple functions with enhanced durability. Herein, the study reports robust and multifunctional textiles with energy harvesting, electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding, flame resistance, and Joule heating capabilities, fabricated by a facile yet effective integration method using the deposition of cross&#8208;linked MXene (Ti3C2Tx), poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) onto traditional Korean paper, Hanji via vacuum filtration. Comprehensive analyses confirm robust cross&#8208;linking, structural integrity, and interface stability in the MXene/PVA/PAA&#8208;Hanji (MPP&#8208;H) textiles, which synergistically boost their multifunctional performance. The MPP&#8208;H textiles exhibit remarkable power generation lasting over 60 min with a power density of 102.2 &#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;3 and an energy density of 31.0 mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 upon the application of 20 &#181;L of NaCl solution. The EMI shielding effectiveness (SE) per unit thickness in the X&#8208;band (8.2&#8211;12.4 GHz) is up to 437.6 dB&#160;mm&#8722;1, with the ratio of absorption to reflection reaching 4.5, outperforming existing EMI shielding materials. Superior thermo&#8208;chemo&#8208;mechanical properties (flame resistance, rapid Joule heating, durability, and washability) further demonstrate their versatile usability. The MPP&#8208;H enables diverse functionalities within a single, robust textile through a scalable fabrication method, offering transformative potential for wearable and mobility platforms.

         <title>Freestanding Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Membrane for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;adaptive HOF (Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework)&#8208;based matrix membranes (HMMs) with exceptional flexibility, high water&#8208;vapor permeability, and significant wound healing activity are successfully fabricated using a simple polymer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;air interface technique. In vitro and in vivo studies in mice wound models demonstrate that the self&#8208;adhesive membrane accelerates wound healing by regulating the inflammatory environment of the damaged tissue and promoting faster re&#8208;epithelialization. Notably, RNA&#8208;seq analysis and mechanistic studies reveal that HMMs effectively reduce inflammation and facilitate the transition from the proliferative stage to the remodeling stage of skin development.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are emerging as multifunctional materials with exceptional biocompatibility, abundant active sites, and tunable porosity, which are highly beneficial for advanced wound care. However, a significant challenge involves transforming pristine HOFs powders into lightweight, ultrathin, freestanding membranes compatible with soft biological systems. Herein, the study successfully develops shape&#8208;adaptive HOF&#8208;based matrix membranes (HMMs) using a polymer&#8208;assisted liquid&#8208;air interface technique. The HMMs conform seamlessly to tissues of different sizes and shapes, effectively stopping bleeding, and provide high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Notably, both in vitro and in vivo studies with mice wound models demonstrated that these tissue&#8208;conformable HMMs significantly accelerate wound healing by modulating the inflammatory environment of the injured tissue and promoting rapid re&#8208;epithelialization. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;seq analysis and mechanistic studies revealed that HMMs effectively reduce inflammation and facilitate the tissue transition from the proliferative stage to the remodeling stage of skin development. This work not only opens up new avenues for advanced wound care materials but also establishes a foundation for hybridizing HOFs with polymers for a wide range of potential applications.

         <title>A Surface&#8208;Reconstructed Bilayer Heterojunction Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface reconstruction helps to further improve the efficiency of solar cells. In this study, a novel surface reconstruction method is presented that transforms the top surface of perovskite films into a bilayer heterojunction (BLH). This BLH structure enables an order of magnitude reduction in surface trap density, reaching 26.1% efficiency in inverted perovskite solar cells with superior long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
The efficiency of perovskite photovoltaics remains distant from their theoretical limits, primarily due to high photovoltage losses. Here a strategy is reported to minimize voltage losses by reconstructing the perovskite surface into a bilayer heterojunction (BLH) structure. Unlike conventional low&#8208;dimensional capping layers, typically constrained to a few nanometers to prevent low fill factors, this methodology facilitates a more comprehensive reaction with surface defects, allowing a more substantial capping layer (&#8776;50 nanometers) without compromising charge transport integrity. Time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity analysis indicates a significant reduction in trap density at the top region of the perovskite film, showing an order of magnitude lower than that of the pristine sample. Incorporating this BLH in inverted cells results in a remarkably low photovoltage deficit of 325&#160;mV, leading to a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.1% (25.72% certified). The encapsulated device maintains 94% of its original efficiency after 1200&#160;h of maximum power point tracking under one sun illumination at 65&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Sterically Hindered Organogels with Self&#8208;Healing, Impact Response, and High Damping Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel intelligent protective organogel composed of a hyperbranched fluid as the bulky solvent that is entrapped by dynamic poly(urethane&#8211;urea) network skeleton due to steric hindrance is synthesized. The organogel exhibited self&#8208;healing properties, high stability, remarkable impact responsiveness, and excellent damping properties. It is expected to significantly contribute to the advancement of omnibearing protective materials in cutting&#8208;edge fields.








Abstract
Organogel materials are vital for impact or shock resistance because of their highly tailored dynamic properties. However, concurrently achieving excellent anti&#8208;impact and damping performances, high stability, and self&#8208;healing properties is challenging. Herein, a novel intelligent protective organogel (IPO) comprising a dynamic boronic ester containing poly(urethane&#8211;urea) as the network skeleton with a matching mesh size is synthesized, the network precisely entraps the hyperbranched fluid used as the bulky solvent via steric hindrance. The IPO exhibits self&#8208;healing ability, excellent impact responsiveness (a 1950&#8208;fold increase in flow stress under various impact speeds), and energy dissipation (the loss factor &gt;0.8 from 10&#8722;4&#160; to 104&#160;Hz). The IPO maintains its dynamic mechanical properties during hot pressing and hydrolysis, exhibiting &#160;high stability. Furthermore, the IPO exhibits omnibearing protection. When used as a protective coating, the IPO dissipates the impact force by 87% and 89% of control upon passive and active impact, respectively. When used as a shock pad, it attenuates 91% of the amplitude&#160;in the high&#8208;frequency vibrations. This study offers a novel perspective on the synthesis of tailored sterically hindered organogel and provides valuable insights into the development of next&#8208;generation intelligent protective materials that exhibit impact and vibration resistance.

         <title>Electrodeposition of Polymer Networks as Conformal and Uniform Ultrathin Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of ultrathin functional coatings that are homogeneous over large areas is already difficult on planar surfaces and even tougher within porous 3D materials. Here, a universal method is reported for obtaining functional polymer networks as uniform ultrathin films on conductive surfaces of any shape by utilizing electrochemically mediated crosslinking of end&#8208;group functionalized polymers.








Abstract
Natural systems, synthetic materials, and devices almost always feature interphases that control the flow of mass and energy or stabilize interfaces between incompatible materials. With technologies transitioning to non&#8208;planar and 3D mesoscale architectures, novel deposition methods for realizing ultrathin coatings and interphases are required. Polymer networks are of particular interest for their tunable chemical and physical properties combined with their structural integrity. Here, the electrodeposition of polymer networks (EPoN) is introduced as a general approach to uniformly coat non&#8208;planar conductive materials. Conceptually, EPoN utilizes electrochemically activated crosslinkers as polymer end groups to confine their network formation exclusively to the material surface upon charge transfer, yielding a passivating and self&#8208;limiting growth of conformal and uniform coatings with tunable submicron thickness on conductive materials. EPoN is found to result in thin functional films of various polymer backbones and side group chemistries as demonstrated for poly(ether) and poly(acrylamide) based polymers as solid electrolyte and thermally responsive interphases, respectively.

         <title>Element Screening Engineering for High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Anodes: Achieving Fast and Robust Li&#8208;Storage With Optimal Working Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Element selection rules for the rational design of high&#8208;entropy alloy anodes are established, leading to the synthesis of high&#8208;entropy alloys GaCuSnInZnGeP&#8326;, GaCu (or Sn) InZnGeP&#8325;, CuSnInZnGeP&#8325;, InZnGePSeS (or Te), and InZnGeP&#8322;S (or Se), which exhibit exceptional lithium storage performance.








Abstract
While the high&#8208;entropy strategy is highly effective in enhancing the performance of materials across various fields, an optimal methodology for selecting component elements for performance optimization is still lacking. Here the findings on uncovering the element selection rules for rational design of high&#8208;entropy alloy anodes with exceptional lithium storage performance are reported. It is investigated high&#8208;entropy element screening rules by modifying stable diamond&#8208;structured Ge with P to induce a tetrahedrally coordinated sphalerite structure for enhanced metallic conductivity, further stabilized by incorporating Zn and other elements. Moreover, both theoretical and experimental results confirm that Li&#8208;storage performance improves with increasing atomic number: BZnGeP3 &lt; AlZnGeP3 &lt; GaZnGeP3 &lt; InZnGeP3. InZnGeP3&#8208;based electrodes demonstrate the highest Li&#8208;ion affinity, fastest electronic and Li&#8208;ion transport, largest Li&#8208;storage capacity and reversibility, and best mechanical integrity. Further element screening based on the above criteria leads to high entropy alloy anodes with metallic conductivity like GaCuSnInZnGeP6, GaCu(or Sn)InZnGeP5, CuSnInZnGeP5, InZnGePSeS(or Te), InZnGeP2S(or Se) which show superior Li&#8208;storage performances. The excellent phase stability is attributed to their high configurational entropy. This study offers profound insights into element screening for high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;based anodes in Li&#8208;ion batteries, providing guidance and reference for the element combination and screening of other high&#8208;entropy functional materials.

         <title>Durable Photo&#8208;Pyroelectric Detection in a Diamine&#8208;Constructed Lead&#8208;Free Hybrid Perovskite Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lead&#8208;free hybrid perovskite ferroelectric (BDA)SbBr5 (1) is constructed for environmentally friendly photo&#8208;pyroelectric (PPE) detection. Compound 1 exhibits ferroelectric phase transition at 380&#160;K, realizing broadband UV&#8211;near infrared PPE detection and switchable pyroelectric current. Its stable performance of PPE detection over 3 months is attributed to hydrogen bonding interactions from diamine.








Abstract
As a subcategory of pyroelectric materials, hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics possess substantial pyroelectric properties and exceptional light absorption characteristics, demonstrating significant potential in the photo&#8208;pyroelectric (PPE) detection field. Despite the significant advantages of hybrid perovskite ferroelectric materials for PPE detection, both the lead issue and the weak stability from van der Waals interactions in monoamines have hindered their further application. Here, 1D lead&#8208;free ferroelectric (BDA)SbBr5 (1, where BDA is 1,4&#8208;butanediammonium) is fabricated to achieve PPE detection. Compound 1 exhibits significant symmetry breaking attributed to the order&#8211;disorder transition of organic cations and octahedral distortions. Specifically, compound 1 enables broad&#8208;spectrum PPE detection from UV to near&#8208;infrared (377&#8211;980&#160;nm) and further realizes switchable pyroelectric current after polarization. More importantly, the stability of the pyroelectric current is preserved without degradation over three months, attributed to the hydrogen bonding interactions of butanediamide. Further theoretical calculations of compound 1 reveal a more negative energy of formation than its monoamine homologs (BA)2SbBr5 (where BA is n&#8208;butylammonium), which is evidence of its stability. These findings highlight 1 as a promising candidate for high&#8208;stability and environmentally friendly PPE wide&#8208;spectrum detection, representing a noteworthy advancement in the ferroelectric field.

         <title>Digital Mechanical Metamaterial with Programmable Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where the property design is realized by programming the digital states of DMM, so as to decouple the design of structure and property. These programmable DMMs yield a spectrum of functionalities including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption, and tunable force transmission.








Abstract
Digitization has brought a new era to the world, liberating information from physical media. The material structure&#8211;property relation is high&#8208;dimensional and nonlinear, and the digitization of structure&#8211;property relations may bring unprecedented functional programmability and diversity. Here, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where property design is realized by programming the digital states of the DMM to decouple the design of the structure and property. Transforming the binary stable states of a curved beam to the digital bit, one unit cell of DMM manifests three distinct deformation responses under compression, i.e., compression&#8211;twist coupling (CTC), compression&#8211;shear coupling (CSC), and pure compression (PC). These deformation modes show notable differences in motion and stiffness, which, by digitally programming a series of DMM, can yield a spectrum of functionalities, including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption in cushioning, effective vibration isolation, and tunable force transmission. This study pioneers a versatile material design paradigm that provides much greater freedom for the property design of intelligent mechanical metamaterials.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where the property design is realized by programming the digital states of DMM, so as to decouple the design of structure and property. These programmable DMMs yield a spectrum of functionalities including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption, and tunable force transmission.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Digitization has brought a new era to the world, liberating information from physical media. The material structure&#8211;property relation is high-dimensional and nonlinear, and the digitization of structure&#8211;property relations may bring unprecedented functional programmability and diversity. Here, a new concept of digital mechanical metamaterial (DMM) is presented, where property design is realized by programming the digital states of the DMM to decouple the design of the structure and property. Transforming the binary stable states of a curved beam to the digital bit, one unit cell of DMM manifests three distinct deformation responses under compression, i.e., compression&#8211;twist coupling (CTC), compression&#8211;shear coupling (CSC), and pure compression (PC). These deformation modes show notable differences in motion and stiffness, which, by digitally programming a series of DMM, can yield a spectrum of functionalities, including information encryption, stress&#8211;strain relation customization, energy absorption in cushioning, effective vibration isolation, and tunable force transmission. This study pioneers a versatile material design paradigm that provides much greater freedom for the property design of intelligent mechanical metamaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Insight into Carrier and Phonon Transports of PbSnS2 Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique carrier and phonon transport characteristics of PbSnS2 crystals are analyzed comprehensively. Both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type PbSnS2 crystals have the advantage of ultralow lattice thermal conductivity, but the differences in doping efficiency and charge density distribution lead to obviously distinct figure of merit (ZT) values and optimal performance directions. This work provides a solid foundation for subsequent research and device assembly.








Abstract
The simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type thermoelectric materials is advantageous to the practical application of the device. As an emerging thermoelectric material, PbSnS2 exhibits highly competitive thermoelectric properties due to its unique carrier and phonon transport characteristics. To promote the utilization of this low&#8208;cost thermoelectric material, p&#8208;type PbSnS2 crystals are synthesized and optimized through Na doping and Se alloying. The resulting thermoelectric transport properties differ significantly from those reported for n&#8208;type crystals, prompting us to compare and analyze both n&#8208;type (Cl&#8208;doped) and p&#8208;type (Na&#8208;doped) PbSnS2 crystals from various perspectives. Cl doping is subject to weaker &#8220;Fermi pinning&#8221; and lower impurity ionization energy compared with Na doping, leading to higher doping efficiency. The different optimal performance directions in n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type crystals can be attributed to the distinct charge density distributions near the conduction band minimum (CBM) and the valence band maximum (VBM). Additionally, both n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type crystals exhibit ultralow lattice thermal conductivity due to the low symmetry of their twisted NaCl structure combined with the strong anharmonicity. This comprehensive analysis of PbSnS2 crystals provides a solid foundation for further performance optimization and device assembly, while also sheds light on the investigation of layered thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Flexible Soft X&#8208;Ray Image Sensors based on Metal Halide Perovskites With High Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With nanothrough network electrode and multidimensional perovskite heterojunction to reduce the photon and carrier loss respectively, this work demonstrates the highest quantum efficiency of perovskite&#8208;based soft X&#8208;ray photodetectors. The devices also show excellent stability under long&#8208;term soft X&#8208;ray radiation and extreme temperatures (10 to 383 K), possessing great potential to serve as pixels of next&#8208;generation curved soft X&#8208;ray image sensor.








Abstract
Soft X&#8208;ray imaging is a powerful tool to explore the structure of cells, probe material with nanometer resolution, and investigate the energetic phenomena in the universe. Conventional soft X&#8208;ray image sensors are by and large Si&#8208;based charge coupled devices that suffer from low frame rates, complex fabrication processes, mechanical inflexibility, and required cooling below &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. Here, a soft X&#8208;ray photodiode is reported based on low&#8208;cost metal halide perovskite with comparable performance to commercial Si&#8208;based device. Nanothrough network electrode&#160;minimized the optical loss due to the shadowing of insensitive layers, while a multidimensional perovskite heterojunction&#160;is generated to reduce the photo&#8208;generated carrier loss. This strategy promoted a record quantum efficiency of 8&#160;&#215;&#160;103% without cooling, several orders of magnitude greater than the previously achieved. Flexible and curved soft X&#8208;ray imaging arrays are fabricated based on this high&#8208;performance device structure, demonstrating stable soft X&#8208;ray response and sharp imaging capabilities. This work highlights the low&#8208;cost and efficient perovskite photodiode as a strong candidate for the next&#8208;generation soft X&#8208;ray image sensors.

         <title>A Mg Battery&#8208;Integrated Bioelectronic Patch Provides Efficient Electrochemical Stimulations for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioelectronic patch composed of an Mg battery integrates capabilities of efficient generation and delivery of electro(chemical) stimulation. Cell culture with the battery offers the potential for elucidating the impact of electric field, ion flux, and chemical release on the structure/function of live cells and tissue. This work identifies new ways where electrochemistry could contribute to the field of bioelectronic medicine.








Abstract
Bioelectronic patches hold promise for patient&#8208;comfort wound healing providing simplified clinical operation. Currently, they face paramount challenges in establishing long&#8208;term effective electronic interfaces with targeted cells and tissues due to the inconsistent energy output and high bio interface impedance. Here a new electrochemical stimulation technology is reported, using a simple wound patch, which integrates the efficient generation and delivery of stimulation. This is realized by employing a hydrogel bioelectronic interface as an active component in an integrated power source (i.e., Mg battery). The Mg battery enhances fibroblast functions (proliferation, migration, and growth factor secretion) and regulates macrophage phenotype (promoting regenerative polarization and down&#8208;regulating pro&#8208;inflammatory cytokines), by providing an electric field and the ability to control the cellular microenvironment through chemical release. This bioelectronic patch shows an effective and accelerated wound closure by guiding epithelial migration, mediating immune response, and promoting vasculogenesis. This new electrochemical&#8208;mediated therapy may provide a new avenue for user&#8208;friendly wound management as well as a platform for fundamental insights into cell stimulation.

         <title>Nanoengineered Neutrophil as 19F&#8208;MRI Tracer for Alert Diagnosis and Severity A of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an inflammatory chemotactic&#8208;engineered neutrophil incorporating perfluoro&#8208;15&#8208;crown&#8208;5&#8208;ether nanoemulsion (Neu@PFC) is reported for targeted 19F&#8208;MRI of acute lung injury. This work presents an appealing approach by combining the biocompatible cell&#8208;based 19F&#8208;MRI tracer with multi&#8208;administration routes for alert diagnosis and severity assessment of pulmonary diseases.








Abstract
Acute lung injury (ALI) is a severe complication in clinical settings. Alert diagnosis and severity assessment of ALI is pivotal to ensure curative treatment and increase survival rates. However, the development of a precise ALI diagnostic strategy remains a pending task. Here, leveraging neutrophil's inflammation&#8208;homing and physiological barrier&#8208;navigating capability, a facile strategy is proposed for achieving targeted 19F&#8208;MRI detection of ALI based on the nanoengineered neutrophil internalized with perfluorocarbon nanoemulsion (Neu@PFC). The remodeling process poses a negligible impact on the neutrophil's inherent activation and transmigration functions. The migratory behavior of Neu@PFC toward pneumonia is confirmed in vivo using an LPS&#8208;induced ALI murine model. Direct intratracheal (i.t.) administration contributes to a vast deposition of Neu@PFC within the lung, allowing for real&#8208;time 19F&#8208;MRI visualization and the potential to predict progressive pneumonia. Furthermore, intravenous (i.v.) administration of Neu@PFC enables quantitative assessment of the extent of ALI due to the chemokine&#8208;guided neutrophil migration. This study not only provides a pathway to diagnose ALI, but also sheds light on the neutrophil recruitment and activation cues in different tissues and inflammatory conditions, which is a prerequisite for developing potential therapeutic approaches.

         <title>Hierarchically Ordered Pore Engineering of Carbon Supports with High&#8208;Density Edge&#8208;Type Single&#8208;Atom Sites to Boost Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hierarchically ordered pore engineering strategy is developed to construct high&#8208;density edge&#8208;type single&#8208;atomic Ni sites on a carbon substrate, achieving ultra&#8208;high activity and selectivity for electroreduction of CO2.








Abstract
Metal sites at the edge of the carbon matrix possess unique geometric and electronic structures, exhibiting higher intrinsic activity than in&#8208;plane sites. However, creating single&#8208;atom catalysts with high&#8208;density edge sites remains challenging. Herein, the hierarchically ordered pore engineering of metal&#8211;organic framework&#8208;based materials to construct high&#8208;density edge&#8208;type single&#8208;atomic Ni sites for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) is reported. The created ordered macroporous structure can expose enriched edges, further increased by hollowing the pore walls, which overcomes the low edge percentage in the traditional microporous substrates. The prepared single&#8208;atomic Ni sites on the ordered macroporous carbon with ultra&#8208;thin hollow walls (Ni/H&#8208;OMC) exhibit Faraday efficiencies of CO above 90% in an ultra&#8208;wide potential window of 600&#160;mV and a turnover frequency of 3.4&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;h&#8722;1, much superior than that of the microporous material with dominant plane&#8208;type sites. Theory calculations reveal that NiN4 sites at the edges have a significantly disrupted charge distribution, forming electron&#8208;rich Ni centers with enhanced adsorption ability with *COOH, thereby boosting CO2RR efficiency. Furthermore, a Zn&#8211;CO2 battery using the Ni/H&#8208;OMC cathode shows an unprecedentedly high power density of 15.9&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and maintains an exceptionally stable charge&#8211;discharge performance over 100&#160;h.

         <title>Concentration&#8208;Switchable Assembly of Carbon Dots for Circularly Polarized Luminescent Amplification in Chiral Logic Gates and Deep&#8208;Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) spanning 460&#8211;709&#160;nm is realized by concentration&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of carbon dots with maximum brightness of 100% and glum&#8208;max of 2.18 &#215; 10&#8722;2. CPL logic gates are designed to show according applications in flexible printing, multilevel encryption and chiral film. Especially, a 660&#160;nm deep red electroluminescent diode is successfully constructed with EQEmax reaching 2%.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive circularly polarized luminescent (CPL) materials are expected to find widespread application in advanced information technologies, such as 3D displays, multilevel encryption, and chiral optical devices. Here, using R&#8208;/S&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylethylamine and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride as precursors, chiral carbon dots (Ch&#8208;CDs) exhibiting bright concentration&#8208;dependent luminescence are synthesized, demonstrating reversible responses in both their morphologies and emission spectra. By adjusting Ch&#8208;CD concentration, the switchable wavelength is extended over 180&#160;nm (539&#8211;720&#160;nm), with the maximum quantum efficiency reaching 100%. Meanwhile, upon increasing Ch&#8208;CD concentration, the emission wavelength red&#8208;shifts, while the chirality of the assembled nanoribbons is synchronously amplified, ultimately achieving CPL at 709&#160;nm and a maximum luminescence asymmetry factor of 2.18 &#215; 10&#8722;2. These values represent the longest wavelength and the largest glum reported for CDs. Considering the remarkable optical properties of the synthesized Ch&#8208;CDs, multilevel chiral logic gates are designed, and their potential practical applications are demonstrated in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting encryption, flexible electronic printing, and solid&#8208;state CPL. Furthermore, deep&#8208;red chiral electroluminescence light&#8208;emitting diodes (EL&#8208;LEDs) are prepared using these Ch&#8208;CDs, achieving an external quantum efficiency of 1.98%, which is the highest value reported to date for CDs in deep&#8208;red EL&#8208;LEDs, and the first report of chiral electronic devices based on CDs.

         <title>Scalable Atomic Arrays for Spin&#8208;Based Quantum Computers in Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>Ion&#8208;implanted silicon donor spin qubits afford exceptional quantum performance and show promise for the maturation to powerful quantum computers using standard semiconductor industry processes. This study presents a comprehensive technological suite for the scalable deterministic construction of donor&#8208;based qubit and qudit arrays that could be used as quantum processor architectures.








Abstract
Semiconductor spin qubits combine excellent quantum performance with the prospect of manufacturing quantum devices using industry&#8208;standard metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (MOS) processes. This applies also to ion&#8208;implanted donor spins, which further afford exceptional coherence times and large Hilbert space dimension in their nuclear spin. Here multiple strategies are demonstrated and integrated to manufacture scale&#8208;up donor&#8208;based quantum computers. 31PF2 molecule implants are used to triple the placement certainty compared to 31P ions, while attaining 99.99% confidence in detecting the implant. Similar confidence is retained by implanting heavier atoms such as 123Sb and 209Bi, which represent high&#8208;dimensional qudits for quantum information processing, while Sb2 molecules enable deterministic formation of closely&#8208;spaced qudits. The deterministic formation of regular arrays of donor atoms with 300&#160;nm spacing is demonstrated, using step&#8208;and&#8208;repeat implantation through a nano aperture. These methods cover the full gamut of technological requirements for the construction of donor&#8208;based quantum computers in silicon.

         <title>Ionic Covalent Organic Framework Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionic covalent organic frameworks (ICOFs) are porous and crystalline materials with ionic moieties installed on the backbone. They can conduct ions selectively, rapidly, and reliably. Recent efforts to improve ionic conductivity, lower manufacturing cost, and reduce contact resistance will enable nicely balanced ICOF electrolytes for the next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable secondary batteries, widely used in modern technology, are essential for mobile and consumer electronic devices and energy storage applications. Lithium (Li)&#8208;ion batteries are currently the most popular choice due to their decent energy density. However, the increasing demand for higher energy density has led to the development of Li metal batteries (LMBs). Despite their potential, the commonly used liquid electrolyte&#8208;based LMBs present serious safety concerns, such as dendrite growth and the risk of fire and explosion. To address these issues, using solid&#8208;state electrolytes in batteries has emerged as a promising solution. In this Perspective, recent advancements are discussed in ionic covalent organic framework (ICOFs)&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes, identify current challenges in the field, and propose future research directions. Highly crystalline ion conductors with polymeric versatility show promise as the next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state electrolytes. Specifically, the use of anionic or cationic COFs is examined for Li&#8208;based batteries, highlight the high interfacial resistance caused by the intrinsic brittleness of crystalline ICOFs as the main limitation, and presents innovative ideas for developing all&#8208; and quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries using ICOF&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes. With these considerations and further developments, the potential for ICOFs is optimistic about enabling the realization of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LMBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Sheet&#8208;Type Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Dual&#8208;Function Li4.4Si Alloy&#8208;Modified Nano Silicon Anodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Regarding the large&#8208;scale fabrication of sulfide all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), silicon anode and thin free&#8208;standing sulfide electrolyte membranes are employed simultaneously toward potentially practical application. Dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling.








Abstract
The silicon&#8208;based anodes are one of the promising anodes to achieve the high energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). Nano silicon (nSi) is considered as a suitable anode material for assembling sheet&#8208;type sulfide ASSBs using thin free&#8208;standing Li6PS5Cl (LPSC) membrane without causing short circuit. However, nSi anodes face a significant challenge in terms of rapid capacity degradation during cycling. To address this issue, dual&#8208;function Li4.4Si modified nSi anode sheets are developed, in which Li4.4Si serves a dual role by not only providing additional Li+ but also stabilizing the anode structure with its low Young's modulus upon cycling. Sheet&#8208;type ASSBs equipped with the Li4.4Si modified nSi anode, thin LPSC membrane, and LiNi0.83Co0.11Mn0.06O2 (NCM811) cathode demonstrate exceptional cycle stability, with a capacity retention of 96.16% at 0.5 C (1.18&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) after 100 cycles and maintain stability for 400 cycles. Furthermore, a remarkable cell&#8208;level energy density of 303.9&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is achieved at a high loading of 5.22 mAh cm&#8722;2, representing a leading level of sulfide ASSBs using electrolyte membranes at room temperature. Consequently, the chemically stable slurry process implemented in the fabrication of Li4.4Si&#8208;modified nSi anode sheet paves the way for scalable applications of high&#8208;performance sulfide ASSBs.

         <title>On the Topotactic Phase Transition Achieving Superconducting Infinite&#8208;Layer Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of many new complex oxides involves topotactic reduction&#8212;a process used to alter electronic structure through the removal of specific oxygen ions. The reaction can be damaging to the crystal lattice, however, and little is known about the reduction process in ultrathin films. Li et&#160;al. observed the reaction in situ using synchrotron X&#8208;ray methods to probe formation of the superconducting nickelate, Nd0.8 Sr0.2NiO2, providing key insights into the nature of the phase transition.








Abstract
Topotactic reduction is critical to a wealth of phase transitions of current interest, including synthesis of the superconducting nickelate Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2, reduced from the initial Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3/SrTiO3 heterostructure. Due to the highly sensitive and often damaging nature of the topotactic reduction, however, only a handful of research groups have been able to reproduce the superconductivity results. A series of in situ synchrotron&#8208;based investigations reveal that this is due to the necessary formation of an initial, ultrathin layer at the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 surface that helps to mediate the introduction of hydrogen into the film such that apical oxygens are first removed from the Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO3 / SrTiO3 (001) interface and delivered into the reducing environment. This allows the square&#8208;planar / perovskite interface to stabilize and propagate from the bottom to the top of the film without the formation of interphase defects. Importantly, neither geometric rotations in the square planar structure nor significant incorporation of hydrogen within the films is detected, obviating its need for superconductivity. These findings unveil the structural basis underlying the transformation pathway and provide important guidance on achieving the superconducting phase in reduced nickelate&#160;systems.

         <title>Functional Thermoplastic Polyurethane Elastomers with &#945;, &#969;&#8208;Hydroxyl End&#8208;Functionalized Polyacrylates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is developed by integrating &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl terminal&#8208;functionalized polyacrylate into the soft segment of traditional polyether polyol. This TPU exhibits exceptional toughness and self&#8208;healing properties, making it unique among standard TPUs. Furthermore, the inclusion of photo&#8208;crosslinkable moiety in the polyacrylate polyol has&#160;successfully demonstrated the first TPU that combines superior elastomeric qualities with photopatterning capabilities.








Abstract
Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) is an essential class of materials for demanding applications, from soft robotics and electronics to medical devices and batteries. However, traditional TPU development is primarily relied on specific soft segments, such as polyether, polyester, and polycarbonate polyols. Here, a novel method is introduced for developing TPU elastomers with enhanced performance and superior functionalities compared to conventional TPUs, achieved through the use of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates. This approach involves a defect&#8208;free synthesis of &#945;,&#969;&#8208;hydroxyl end&#8208;functionalized polyacrylates through visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven photoiniferter polymerization. By strategically blending these functionalized polyacrylates with conventional polyols, TPUs that exhibit exceptional toughness and notable self&#8208;healing capabilities, traits rarely found in existing TPUs are engineered. Furthermore, incorporating photo&#8208;crosslinkable acrylic monomers has enabled the creation of the first TPU with superior elastomeric properties and photopatterning capabilities. This approach paves the way for a new direction in polyurethane engineering, introducing a novel class of soft segments and unlocking the potential for a wide range of advanced applications.

         <title>Soft, Tough, Antifatigue Fracture Elastomer Composites with Low Thermal Resistance through Synergistic Crack Pinning and Interfacial Slippage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A soft, extreme fracture tough and antifatigue fracture polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite is developed by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The elastomer composite also maintains low thermal resistance, which makes it highly promising for thermal interface applications in heat dissipation of electronic devices.








Abstract
Soft elastomer composites are promising functional materials for engineer interfaces, where the miniaturized electronic devices have triggered increasing demand for effective heat dissipation, high fracture energy, and antifatigue fracture. However, such a combination of these properties can be rarely met in the same elastomer composites simultaneously. Here a strategy is presented to fabricate a soft, extreme fracture tough (3316&#160;J m&#8722;2) and antifatigue fracture (1052.56&#160;J m&#8315;2) polydimethylsiloxane/aluminum elastomer composite. These outstanding properties are achieved by optimizing the dangling chains and spherical aluminum fillers, resulting in the combined effects of crack pinning and interfacial slippage. The dangling chains that lengthen the polymer chains between cross&#8208;linked points pin the cracks and the rigid fillers obstruct the cracks, enhancing the energy per unit area needed for fatigue failure. The dangling chains also promote polymer/filler interfacial slippage, enabling effective deflection and blunting of an advancing crack tip, thus enhancing mechanical energy dissipation. Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm2 W&#8722;1), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.

Moreover, the elastomer composite exhibits low thermal resistance (&#8776;0.12&#160;K cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), due to the formation of a thermally conductive network. These remarkable characteristics render this elastomer composite promising for application as a thermal interface material in electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Critical&#8208;Layered MoS2 for the Enhancement of Supercontinuum Generation in Photonic Crystal Fibre</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solid&#8208;state 2D optical layers with ultrahigh nonlinearity are subtly integrated into the commercial photonic crystal fiber to boost its supercontinuum generation efficiency. The hybrid MoS2&#8208;PCF demonstrates a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning and manifests a critical&#8208;layered characteristic that only work under a real 2D regime.








Abstract
Supercontinuum generation (SCG) from silica&#8208;based photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) is of highly technological significance from microscopy to metrology, but has been hindered by silica's relatively low intrinsic optical nonlinearity. The prevailing approaches of filling PCF with nonlinear gases or liquids can endow fibre with enhanced optical nonlinearity and boosted SCG efficiency, yet these hybrids are easily plagued by fusion complexity, environmental incompatibility or transmission mode instability. Here this work presents&#160;a strategy of embedding solid&#8208;state 2D MoS2 atomic layers into the air&#8208;holes of PCF to efficiently enhance SCG. This work demonstrates a 4.8 times enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient and a 70% reduction of the threshold power for SCG with one octave spanning in the MoS2&#8208;PCF hybrid. Furthermore, this work finds that the SCG enhancement is highly layer&#8208;dependent, which only manifests for a real 2D regime within the thickness of five atomic layers. Theoretical calculations reveal that the critical thickness arises from the trade&#8208;off among the layer&#8208;dependent enhancement of the nonlinear coefficient, leakage of fundamental mode and redshift of zero&#8208;dispersion wavelength. This work provides significant advances toward efficient SCG, and highlights the importance of matching an appropriate atomic layer number in the design of functional 2D material optical fibers.

         <title>Concurrent Amorphization and Nanocatalyst Formation in Cu&#8208;Substituted Perovskite Oxide Surface: Effects on Oxygen Reduction Reaction at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface amorphization and the nanocatalysts ex&#8208;solution are concurrently evolved on Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; through a straightforward reduction process with prolonged time. The investigation focuses on understanding the evolution process of these phenomena and identifying the factors that contribute to improvements in performance and durability. These findings offer a practical and novel strategy for designing catalysts with redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.








Abstract
The activity and durability of chemical/electrochemical catalysts are significantly influenced by their surface environments, highlighting the importance of thoroughly examining the catalyst surface. Here, Cu&#8208;substituted La0.6Sr0.4Co0.2Fe0.8O3&#8208;&#948; is selected, a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art material for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), to explore the real&#8208;time evolution of surface morphology and chemistry under a reducing atmosphere at elevated temperatures. Remarkably, in a pioneering observation, it is discovered that the perovskite surface starts to amorphize at an unusually low temperature of approximately 100 &#176;C and multicomponent metal nanocatalysts additionally form on the amorphous surface as the temperature raises to 400 &#176;C. Moreover, this investigation into the stability of the resulting amorphous layer under oxidizing conditions reveals that the amorphous structure can withstand a high&#8208;temperature oxidizing atmosphere (&#8805;650 &#176;C) only when it has undergone sufficient reduction for an extended period. Therefore, the coexistence of the active nanocatalysts and defective amorphous surface leads to a nearly 100% enhancement in the electrode resistance for the ORR over 200 h without significant degradation. These observations provide a new catalytic design strategy for using redox&#8208;dynamic perovskite oxide host materials.

         <title>Molecule Anchoring Strategy Promotes Vertically Homogeneous Crystallization and Aligned Interfaces for Efficient Pb&#8211;Sn Perovskite Solar Cells and Tandem Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecule anchoring strategy is proposed to construct Pb&#8211;Sn perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces, which produces narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells with a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% and a record&#8208;high fill factor of 82.14%. Corresponding four&#8208;terminal (4T) all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites are ideal candidates as rear subcell in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Because Pb&#8211;Sn perovskites contain multiple components, the rational regulation of vertical structure and both interfaces of the film is primarily crucial to achieve high&#8208;performing NBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a molecule anchoring strategy is developed to in situ construct Cs0.1MA0.3FA0.6Pb0.5Sn0.5I3 perovskite film with vertically aligned crystals and optimized interfaces. Specifically, l&#8208;alanine methyl ester is developed as an anchoring additive to induce the vertical crystal growth, while PEA2PbI3SCN film is introduced to promote the homogeneous crystallization at the buried interface via SCN&#8722; anchoring with cations. Further ethylenediamine dihalides (EDA(I/Cl)2) post&#8208;treatment leads to the gradient energy level alignment on the film surface. Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs based on such film show efficient charge transport and extraction, producing a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.3% with an impressive fill factor of 82.14%. Notably, combining with semitransparent 1.78 eV wide&#8208;bandgap PSCs, the four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem device achieves a PCE of 27.1%. This work opens up a new pathway to boost the performance of Pb&#8211;Sn PSCs and their tandem devices.

         <title>A Degradable Bioelectronic Scaffold for Localized Cell Transfection toward Enhancing Wound Healing in a 3D Space</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repair patch achieves synchronized healing of the epidermis and dermis layers of large skin wounds in a 3D space by providing a spatial distribution scaffold for repair&#8208;related cells and increasing the secretion of healing&#8208;related factors, and this repair method not only significantly shortens the healing time but also leads to skin characteristics that are more normal after healing.








Abstract
Large skin wounds, with extensive surface area and deep vertical full&#8208;thickness involvement, can pose significant challenges in clinical settings. Traditional routes for repairing skin wounds encompass three hallmarks: 1) scab formation for hemostasis; 2) proliferation and migration of epidermal cells for wound closure; 3) proliferation, migration, and functionalization of fibroblasts and endothelial cells for dermal remodeling. However, this route face remarkable challenges to healing large wounds, usually leading to disordered structures and loss of functions in the regenerated skin, due to limited control on the transition among the three stages. In this work, an implantable bioelectronics is developed that enables the synchronization of the three stages, offering accelerated and high&#8208;quality healing of large skin wounds. The system efficiently electro&#8208;transfect local cells near the wounds, forcing cellular proliferation, while providing a 3D porous environments for synchronized migration of epidermal and dermal cells. In vivo experiments demonstrated that the system achieved synchronous progression of multiple layers within the wounds, leading to the reconstruction of a complete skin structure similar to healthy skin, which presents a new avenue for the clinical translation of large wound healing.

         <title>Fourier Surfaces Reaching Full&#8208;Color Diffraction Limits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rising demand for transformative optical devices derives the importance of optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs) minimizing optical loss of diffraction. To address the current&#160;challenges of OFSs regarding scalability and full&#8208;color diffraction, an integrative manufacturing strategy is presented for the first realization of scalable and fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental diffraction limits at the full&#8208;visible regimes.








Abstract
Optical Fourier surfaces (OFSs), characterized by sinusoidally profiled diffractive optical elements, can outperform traditional binary&#8208;type counterparts by minimizing optical noise through selectively driving diffraction at desired frequencies. While scanning probe lithography (SPL), gray&#8208;scale electron beam lithography (EBL), and holographic inscriptions are effective for fabricating OFSs, achieving full&#8208;color diffractions at fundamental efficiency limits is challenging. Here, an integrated manufacturing process is presented, validated theoretically and experimentally, for fully transparent OFSs reaching the fundamental limit of diffraction efficiency. Leveraging holographic inscriptions and soft nanoimprinting, this approach effectively addresses challenges in conventional OFS manufacturing, enabling scalable production of noise&#8208;free and maximally efficient OFSs with record&#8208;high throughput (1010&#8211;1012 &#181;m2&#160;h&#8722;1), surpassing SPL and EBL by 1010 times. Toward this end, a wafer&#8208;scale OFSs array is demonstrated consisting of full&#8208;color diffractive gratings, color graphics, and microlenses by the one&#8208;step nanoimprinting, which is readily compatible with rapid prototyping of OFSs even on curved panels, demanding for transformative optical devices such as augmented and virtual reality displays.

         <title>Toward Predicting the Formation of Integral&#8208;Asymmetric, Isoporous Diblock Copolymer Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) of block copolymers and solvents enable the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, the dependence of the membrane morphology on structural, thermodynamic (e.g., incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block and nonsolvent), kinetic (e.g., vitrification threshold), and process parameters (e.g., duration of EISA) is predicted. Examining the top layer and substructure,&#160;the findings are verified through experiment.








Abstract
The self&#8208;assembly and nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (SNIPS) process of block copolymers and solvents enables the fabrication of integral&#8208;asymmetric, isoporous membranes. An isoporous top layer is formed by evaporation&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly (EISA) and imparts selectivity for ultrafiltration of functional macromolecules or water purification. This selective layer is&#160;supported by a macroporous bottom structure that is formed by nonsolvent&#8208;induced phase separation (NIPS) providing mechanical stability. Thereby the permeability/selectivity tradeoff is optimized. The SNIPS fabrication involves various physical phenomena&#8212;e.g.,&#160;evaporation, self&#8208;assembly, macrophase separation, vitrification &#8211; and multiple structural, thermodynamic, kinetic, and process parameters. Optimizing membrane properties and rationally designing fabrication processes is a challenge which particle simulation can significantly contribute to. Using large&#8208;scale particle simulations, it is observed that 1) a small incompatibility between matrix&#8208;forming block of the copolymer and nonsolvent, 2) a glassy arrest that occurs at a smaller polymer concentration, or 3) a higher dynamical contrast between polymer and solvent results in a finer, spongy substructure, whereas the opposite parameter choice gives rise to larger macropores with an elongated shape. These observations are confirmed by comparison to experiments on polystyrene (PS)&#8208;block&#8208;poly(4&#8208;vinylpyridine) (P4VP) diblock copolymer membranes, varying the chemical nature of the coagulant or the temperature of coagulation&#160;bath.

         <title>Flexible Single Microwire X&#8208;Ray Detector with Ultrahigh Sensitivity for Portable Radiation Detection System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible X&#8208;ray detector based on a single Ga2O3:In microwire is demonstrated, which exhibits excellent sensitivity and low detection limits. Then, based on this, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system that can detect X&#8208;rays in real&#8208;time is prepared. This work is of great significance for the development of sensitive, stable, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector.








Abstract
Sensitive, flexible, and low false alarm rate X&#8208;ray detector is crucial for medical diagnosis, industrial inspection, and scientific research. However, most semiconductors for X&#8208;ray detectors are susceptible to interference from ambient light, and their high thickness hinders their application in wearable electronics. Herein, a flexible visible&#8208;blind and ultraviolet&#8208;blind X&#8208;ray detector based on Indium&#8208;doped Gallium oxide (Ga2O3:In) single microwire is prepared. Joint experiment&#8722;theory characterizations reveal that the Ga2O3:In microwire possess a high crystal quality, large band gap, and satisfactory stability, and reliability. On this basis, an extraordinary sensitivity of 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 67.4&#160;nGyair&#160;s&#8722;1 are achieved based on the prepared Ag/Ga2O3:In/Ag device, which has outstanding operation stability and excellent high temperature stability. Taking advantage of the flexible properties of the single microwire, a portable X&#8208;ray detection system is demonstrated that shows the potential to adapt to flexible and lightweight formats. The proposed X&#8208;ray detection system enables real&#8208;time monitor for X&#8208;rays, which can be displayed on the user interface. More importantly, it has excellent resistance to natural light interference, showing a low false alarm rate. This work provides a feasible method for exploring high&#8208;performance flexible integrated micro/nano X&#8208;ray detection devices.

         <title>Achieving Super&#8208;Metallophobicity on Silicon&#8208;based Ceramics at High Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Super&#8208;metallophobivity is achieved on silicon&#8208;based ceramics at high temperature by various non&#8208;ferrous molten metals (T&gt; 523&#160;K). The extraordinary property is induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on micro&#8208;nanostructured surface of Si2N2O, which offers worthy insights for expansive applications such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry and so on.








Abstract
As a critical concept in physical chemistry, superwettability is widely concerned in both fundamental science and practical engineering in past few decades. Despite this, investigation on high temperature superwettability is still a void, which is significant both in scientific and industrial fields. Herein, a ceramic with specific high temperature non&#8208;wetting property, Si2N2O is proposed. Compared with other materials, Si2N2O is elucidated with better practical non&#8208;wetting property against various non&#8208;ferrous metals. Combining with micro&#8208;nanostructures, the metallophobicity is further improved (contact angle &gt;150&#176; and contact angle hysteresis &#8776;0&#176;). The extraordinary metal repellency is defined as &#8220;super&#8208;metallophobicity&#8221;, which is proved to be induced by distinctive thermodynamic and dynamic wetting behavior on the rough surface. The research of super&#8208;metallophobicity not only sheds light on superwettability at high temperature, but also offers worthy insights for future potential material design in a wide range of applications, such as metallurgy, 3D printing and semiconductor industry.

         <title>Blue Laser Triggered Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel for Gastrointestinal Bleeding Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) consists of a self&#8208;assembly peptide (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) to induce ultrafast hemostasis. Moreover, HPH can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment.








Abstract
In an emergency, nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding (NVUGIB), endoscopic hemostasis is considered the gold standard intervention. However, current endoscopic hemostasis is very challenging to manage bleeding in large&#8208;diameter or deep lesions highly prone to rebleeding risk. Herein, a novel hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) is reported, consisting of a self&#8208;assembly peptide sequence CFLIVIGSIIVPGDGVPGDG (PFV) and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA), which can be triggered by blue laser endoscopy (BLE) for nonvariceal upper gastrointestinal bleeding treatment without recurring bleeding concerns. Upon contact with GelMA solution, PFV immediately fibrillates into &#946;&#8208;sheet nanofiber and solvent&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly to form HPH gel. HPH nanofiber networks induced ultrafast coagulation by enveloping blood cells and activating platelets and coagulation factors even to the blood with coagulopathy. Besides its remarkable hemostatic performance in artery and liver injury models, HPH achieves instant bleeding management in porcine NVUGIB models within 60&#160;s by preventing the rebleeding risk. This work demonstrates an extraordinary hemostatic agent for NVUGIB intervention by BLE for the first time, broadening potential application scenarios, including patients with coagulopathy and promising clinical prospects.

         <title>3D&#8208;Mapping and Manipulation of Photocurrent in an Optoelectronic Diamond Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical currents flowing inside diamond are detected in three dimensions using the charge state of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) defects, which act as a trip&#8208;wire detector for hole current. Time&#8208;resolved imaging and direct measurement of photocurrent is combined with optical engineering of nitrogen impurities to reveal the complex dynamics of charge transport in a wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductor.








Abstract
Establishing connections between material impurities and charge transport properties in emerging electronic and quantum materials, such as wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, demands new diagnostic methods tailored to these unique systems. Many such materials host optically&#8208;active defect centers which offer a powerful in situ characterization system, but one that typically relies on the weak spin&#8208;electric field coupling to measure electronic phenomena. In this work, charge&#8208;state sensitive optical microscopy is combined with photoelectric detection of an array of nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers to directly image the flow of charge carriers inside a diamond optoelectronic device, in 3D and with temporal resolution. Optical control is used to change the charge state of background impurities inside the diamond on&#8208;demand, resulting in drastically different current flow such as filamentary channels nucleating from specific, defective regions of the device. Conducting channels that control carrier flow, key steps toward optically reconfigurable, wide&#8208;bandgap optoelectronics are then engineered using light. This work might be extended to probe other wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (SiC, GaN) relevant to present and emerging electronic and quantum&#160;technologies.

         <title>Impregnate Carbonation: CO2&#8208;Guided In Situ Growth of Robust Superhydrophobic Structures on Concrete Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by concrete carbonation phenomenon, a method for in situ growing superhydrophobic concrete surface is proposed: Concrete is impregnated in Mg2+&#8208;silane solution for carbonation. Mg2+ irregularly segments the morphology of CaCO3, and silane lowers the surface energy. The concrete by impregnate carbonation is divided into a three&#8208;layer structure of superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic, providing stable waterproof protection for the hydrophilic matrix.








Abstract
Superhydrophobic surfaces applying on concrete can greatly improve the durability of concrete by preventing the damage from water. However, traditional design of superhydrophobic concrete surfaces by external coating encounters to problems of flaking and poor surface robustness, while that by adding hydrophobic agents or particles faces the challenges of strength damage of concrete. Drawing inspiration from the carbonation phenomenon of concrete, here a new design of in situ growing superhydrophobic structures on concrete is proposed: The concrete sample is impregnated into Mg2+&#8208;containing silane&#8211;water system with continuous CO2 injection. The contact angle of the concrete surface achieves 171.9&#176; without obvious strength decrease after 120 min, which are mainly attributed to the formation of CaxMg1&#8722;xCO3 crystals with micro&#8208;nano&#8208;structures and the reduction of carbonates surface energy by silane. This superhydrophobic concrete structure can be divided into a superhydrophobic&#8211;hydrophobic&#8211;hydrophilic three layers structure, providing the stable water&#8208;proof protection under mechanical fatigue, capillary water absorption, UV aging, sulfate attack, and impurity water impact tests due to the in situ growing robust superhydrophobic structures. Furthermore, it captures 29.80&#160;g&#160;m&#8722;2 CO2 during the reaction process, providing new insights for the design and preparation of eco&#8208;friendly superhydrophobic concrete.

         <title>Direct Observations of Spontaneous In&#8208;Plane Electronic Polarization in 2D Te Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;element tellurium (Te) films are experimentally demonstrated to host an in&#8208;plane spontaneous electronic polarization, evident with reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The imaged moir&#233; superlattice can be effectively tuned at the polarization edges. The polarization can survive irrespective of the film thickness and supporting substrates, validating its robustness and universality.








Abstract
Single&#8208;element polarization in low dimensions is fascinating for constructing next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics with multiple functionalities, yet remains difficult to access with satisfactory performance. Here, spectroscopic evidences are presented for the spontaneous electronic polarization in tellurium (Te) films thinned down to bilayer, characterized by low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. The unique chiral structure and centrosymmetry&#8208;breaking character in 2D&#160;Te gives rise to sizable in&#8208;plane polarization with accumulated charges, which is demonstrated by the reversed band&#8208;bending trends at opposite polarization edges in spatially resolved spectra and conductance mappings. The polarity of charges exhibits intriguing influence on imaging the moir&#233; superlattice at the Te&#8208;graphene interface. Moreover, the plain spontaneous polarization robustly exists for various film thicknesses, and can universally preserve against different epitaxial substrates. The experimental validations of considerable electronic polarization in Te multilayers thus provide a realistic platform for promisingly facilitating reliable applications in microelectronic devices.

         <title>Realization of a 2D Lieb Lattice in a Metal&#8211;Inorganic Framework with Partial Flat Bands and Topological Edge States</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flat bands, Dirac cones, and van Hove singularities in the Lieb lattice, unveiling a multitude of fascinating physical phenomena, are still highly sought. Here, theoretical analysis with experimental validation is combined to explore an innovative approach circumventing structural instability to realize a 2D Lieb lattice, showcasing its partial flat bands and topological edge states.









Abstract
Flat bands and Dirac cones in materials are the source of the exotic electronic and topological properties. The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a 2D Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum&#8208;Phosphorus (Pt&#8208;P) Lieb lattice, it has successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low&#8208;temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verify the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin&#8208;orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms are predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal&#8211;inorganic framework&#8208;based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.

The Lieb lattice is expected to host these electronic structures, arising from quantum destructive interference. Nevertheless, the experimental realization of a 2D Lieb lattice remained challenging to date due to its intrinsic structural instability. After computationally designing a Platinum-Phosphorus (Pt-P) Lieb lattice, it has successfully overcome its structural instability and synthesized on a gold substrate via molecular beam epitaxy. Low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy verify the Lieb lattice's morphology and electronic flat bands. Furthermore, topological Dirac edge states stemming from pronounced spin-orbit coupling induced by heavy Pt atoms are predicted. These findings convincingly open perspectives for creating metal&#8211;inorganic framework-based atomic lattices, offering prospects for strongly correlated phases interplayed with topology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulation of Molecular Microheterogeneity in Electrolytes Enables Ampere&#8208;Hour&#8208;Level Aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 Pouch Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimally regulating molecular microheterogeneity in aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes provides an effective means to reorganize the spatial distribution of H2O molecules, isolating H2O&#8208;rich microclusters. This reorganization significantly impedes H2O activity, enhancing electrochemical stability without compromising rapid transport of Li cations. With this electrolyte design, ampere&#8208;hour&#8208;level aqueous LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 pouch cell exhibits high energy density and excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Aqueous batteries are attractive due to their high safety and fast reaction kinetics, but the narrow electrochemical stability window of H2O limits their applications. It is a big challenge to broaden the electrochemical operation window of aqueous electrolytes while retaining fast reaction kinetics. Here, a new organic aqueous mixture electrolyte of manipulatable (3D)&#160;molecular microheterogeneity with H2O&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;poor domains is demonstrated. H2O&#8208;poor domains molecularly surround the reformed microclusters of H2O molecules through interfacial H&#8208;bonds, which thus not only inhibit the long&#8208;range transfer of H2O but also allow fast and consecutive Li+ transport. This new design enables low&#8208;voltage anodes reversibly cycling with aqueous&#8208;based electrolytes and high ionic conductivity of 4.5 mS cm&#8722;1. LiMn2O4||Li4Ti5O12 full cells demonstrate excellent cycling stability over 1000 cycles under various C rates and a low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. 1 Ah pouch cell delivers a high energy density of 79.3&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and high Coulombic efficiency of 99.4% at 1 C over 200 cycles. This work provides new insights into the design of electrolytes based on the molecular microheterogeneity for rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Precise Lubrication and Protection of Cartilage Damage by Targeting Hydrogel Microsphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microsphere is developed to specifically and precisely lubricate and protect the local injury site of early&#8208;stage osteoarthritis (OA). The in vivo experiments demonstrate that even with a single small dose injection, this precise lubrication strategy can effectively slow down the progression of early OA and alleviate the associated pain.








Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative bone and joint disease characterized by decreased cartilage lubrication, leading to continuous wear and ultimately irreversible damage. This situation is particularly challenging for early&#8208;stage OA, as current bio&#8208;lubricants lack precise targeting for small inflammatory lesions. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated targeting hydrogel microspheres (HMS) is developed to precisely lubricate the local injury site of cartilage and prevent the progression of early OA. Anti&#8208;Collagen type I (Anti&#8208;Col1) is an antibody that targets cartilage injury sites in early OA stages. It is anchored on a HMS matrix made of Gelatin methacrylate (GelMA) and poly (sulfobetaine methacrylate) (PSBMA) to create targeted HMS (T&#8208;G/S HMS). The T&#8208;G/S HMS's high hydrophilicity, along with the dynamic interaction between its surficial Anti&#8208;Col1 and the Col1 on cartilage injury site, ensures its precise and effective lubrication of early OA lesions. Consequently, injecting T&#8208;G/S HMS into rats with early OA significantly slows disease progression and reduces symptoms. In conclusion, the developed injectable targeted lubricating HMS and the precisely targeted lubrication strategy represent a promising, convenient technique for treating OA, particularly for slowing the early&#8208;stage OA progression.

         <title>Tailoring Polaron Dimensions in Lead&#8208;Tin Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The two bottles represent the perovskite lattices of MAPbI3 and MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, respectively. Upon photoexcitation, polarons are generated within the perovskites. The various balls illustrate polarons with different sizes. In MAPbI3, the polaron size is larger, resulting in a significantly limited polaron density. Conversely, in MASn0.25Pb0.75I3, the smaller polaron size facilitates a much higher polaron density.








Abstract
Charge carriers in the soft and polar perovskite lattice form so&#8208;called polaron quasiparticles, charge carriers dressed with a lattice deformation. The spatial extent of a polaron is governed by the material's electron&#8208;phonon interaction strength, which determines charge carrier effective mass, mobility, and the so&#8208;called Mott polaron density, that is, the maximum stable density of charge carriers that a perovskite can support. Despite its significance, controlling polaron dimensions has been challenging. Here, experimental substantial tuning of polaron dimensions is reported by lattice engineering, through Pb/Sn substitution in CH3NH3SnxPb1&#8722;xI3. The polaron dimension is deduced from the Mott polaron density, which can be composition&#8208;tuned over an order of magnitude, while charge carrier mobility occurs through band transport, and remains substantial across all compositions, ranging from 10&#160;s to 100 s&#160;cm2&#160;V s&#8722;1 at room temperature. The effective modulation of polaron size can be understood by considering the bond asymmetry after carrier injection as well as the random spatial distribution of Pb/Sn ions. This study underscores the potential for tailoring polaron dimensions, which is crucial for optimizing applications prioritizing either high charge carrier density or high mobility.

         <title>Inducing One&#8208;Step Dehydrogenation of Magnesium Borohydride via Confinement in Robust Dodecahedral Nitrogen&#8208;Doped Porous Carbon Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones with extremely high specific surface area and pore volume, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2, realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation and superior reversibility.








Abstract
A dodecahedral activated N&#8208;doped porous carbon scaffold is synthesized and used for the nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2. The optimized mesoporous scaffold possesses an accumulated pore width of 2.65&#160;nm, high specific surface area (3955.9 m2&#160;g&#8722;1), and large pore volume (2.15 cm3&#160;g&#8722;1), providing ample space for the confinement of Mg(BH4)2 particles and numerous surface active sites for interactions with the same. The confined Mg(BH4)2 system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H2, and an almost single&#8208;step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH4)2 and realization of one&#8208;step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N&#8208;doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB12H12 intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg&#8208;based borohydride systems.

The confined Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system features a dehydrogenation onset temperature of 81.5&#160;&#176;C, an extremely high capacity of 10.2 wt% H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and an almost single-step dehydrogenation profile. Moreover, the system exhibits superior capacity retention of 82.7% after 20 cycles at a moderate temperature of 250&#160;&#176;C. Precise activation control enables a transformation from microporous carbon materials to mesoporous ones, and hence the efficient nanoconfinement of Mg(BH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and realization of one-step dehydrogenation. The evolution of borohydride intermediates is systematically revealed throughout the cycling process. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate defective N heteroatoms within the scaffold are vital in reducing the strength of B&#9472;H bonds, and the N-doped carbon can facilitate decomposition of the irreversible MgB&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; intermediate. This study opens up new avenues for designing robust carbon scaffolds doped with heteroatoms and analyzing intermediate evolution in nanoconfined Mg-based borohydride systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Assembling polar entities in structures of various shapes promises the design of the electronic properties of materials outside the beaten paths. The current perspective article suggests strategies for the application of such polar layers at hybrid interfaces, in van der Waals heterostructures, in polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks, and in covalent organic frameworks comprising pores decorated with polar groups.








Abstract
Collective electrostatic effects arise from the superposition of electrostatic potentials of periodically arranged (di)polar entities and are known to crucially impact the electronic structures of hybrid interfaces. Here, it is discussed, how they can be used outside the beaten paths of materials design for realizing systems with advanced and sometimes unprecedented properties. The versatility of the approach is demonstrated by applying electrostatic design not only to metal&#8208;organic interfaces and adsorbed (complex) monolayers, but also to inter&#8208;layer interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures, to polar metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the cylindrical pores of covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The presented design ideas are straightforward to simulate and especially for metal&#8208;organic interfaces also their experimental implementation has been amply demonstrated. For van der Waals heterostructures, the needed building blocks are available, while the required assembly approaches are just being developed. Conversely, for MOFs the necessary growth techniques exist, but more work on advanced linker molecules is required. Finally, COF structures exist that contain pores decorated with polar groups, but the electrostatic impact of these groups has been largely ignored so far. All this suggest that the dawn of the age of electrostatic design is currently experienced with potential breakthroughs lying ahead.

         <title>Intelligent Supramolecular Modification for Implants: Endogenous Regulation of Bone Defect Repair in Osteoporosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface suitable for bone defect repair under iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It providing new ideas for the refinement and specialized modification of the implant surface.








Abstract
Addressing osteoporosis&#8208;related bone defects, a supramolecular strategy is innovated for modifying carbon fiber reinforced polyether ether ketone (CF/PEEK) composites. By covalently attaching intelligent macromolecules via in situ RAFT polymerization, leveraging the unique pathological microenvironment in patients with iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporosis, intelligent supramolecular modified implant surface possesses multiple endogenous modulation capabilities. After implantation, surface brush&#8208;like macromolecules initially resist macrophage adhesion, thereby reducing the level of immune inflammation. Over time, the molecular chains undergo conformational changes due to Fe (III) mediated supramolecular self&#8208;assembly, transforming into mechanistic signals. These signals are then specifically transmitted to pre&#8208;osteoblast cell through the binding capacity of the KRSR short peptide at the molecular terminus, induced their osteogenic differentiation via the YAP/&#946;&#8208;catenin signaling axis. Furthermore, osteoblasts secrete alkaline phosphatase (ALP), which significantly hydrolyzes phosphate ester bonds in surface macromolecular side groups, resulting in the release of alendronate (ALN). This process further improves the local osteoporotic microenvironment. This intelligent surface modification tailors bone repair to individual conditions, automatically realize multiple endogenous regulation once implanted, and truly realize spontaneous activation of a series of responses conducive to bone repair in vivo. It is evidenced by improved bone regeneration in iron&#8208;overloaded osteoporotic rabbits and supported by in vitro validations.

         <title>Flexible Terahertz Metasurface Absorbers Empowered by Bound States in the Continuum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study connects absorbers with bound states in the continuum by systematically exploring radiation properties from a perspective of lattice symmetry. A flexible terahertz absorber is demonstrated with stable and high absorption coefficient covering a large field of view, with tunable bandwidth, and multiband absorption. It would provide valuable insights for terahertz applications in communications, detection, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
Terahertz absorbers are crucial to the cutting&#8208;edge techniques in the next&#8208;generation wireless communications, imaging, sensing, and radar stealth, as they fundamentally determine the performance of detectors and cloaking capabilities. It has long been a pressing task to find absorbers with customizable performance that can adapt to various environments with low cost and great flexibility. Here, perfect absorption empowered by bound states in the continuum (BICs)&#160;is demonstrated,&#160;allowing for the tailoring of absorption coefficient, bandwidth, and field of view. The one&#8208;port absorbers are interpreted using temporal coupled&#8208;mode theory highlighting the dominant role of BICs in the far&#8208;field radiation properties. Through a thorough investigation of BICs from the perspective of lattice symmetry, the radiation features of three BIC modes are unraveled using both multipolar and topological analysis. The versatile radiation capabilities of BICs provide ample freedom to meet specific requirements of absorbers, including tunable bandwidth, stable performance in a large field of view, and multiband absorption using a thin and flexible film without extreme geometric demands. These findings offer a systematic approach to developing optoelectronic devices and demonstrate the significant potential of BICs for optical and photonic applications, which will stimulate further studies on terahertz photonics and metasurfaces.

         <title>Efficient Generation of Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarized Spin Current in Polycrystalline Heavy Metal Devices with Broken Electric Symmetries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Z&#8208;spin current has the potential to enable energy&#8208;efficient switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. The work by Lijun Zhu and co&#8208;workers reports the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8211;torque memory and computing technologies.








Abstract
Spin currents of perpendicularly polarized spins (z spins) have received blooming interest for the potential in energy&#8208;efficient spin&#8211;orbit torque switching of perpendicular magnetization in the absence of a magnetic field. However, generation of z spins is limited mainly to magnetically or crystallographically low&#8208;symmetry single crystals that are hardly compatible with the integration to semiconductor circuits. This work reports efficient generation of z spins in sputter&#8208;deposited polycrystalline heavy metal devices via a new mechanism of broken electric symmetries in both the transverse and perpendicular directions. Both the damping&#8208;like and field&#8208;like spin&#8211;orbit torques of z spins can be tuned significantly by varying the degree of the electric asymmetries via the length, width, and thickness of devices as well as by varying the type of the heavy metals. The presence of z spins also enables deterministic, nearly&#8208;full, external&#8208;magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching of a uniform perpendicularly magnetized FeCoB layer, the core structure of magnetic tunnel junctions, with high coercivity at a low current density. These results establish the first universal, energy&#8208;efficient, integration&#8208;friendly approach to generate z&#8208;spin current by electric asymmetry design for dense and low&#8208;power spin&#8208;torque memory and computing technologies and will stimulate investigation of z&#8208;spin currents in various polycrystalline materials.

         <title>Edible Ultralong Organic Phosphorescent Excipient for Afterglow Visualizing the Quality of Tablets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edible excipient with intrinsically multistimuli responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) property is developed to achieve nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120) and moisture with improved sensitivity (5.0 times to conventional fluorescence) of drug tablets. The naked&#8208;eye visible UOP shows promise in both promoting continuous smart manufacturing and safe medicine for patients.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive ultralong organic phosphorescence (UOP) materials that in response to external factors such as light, heat, and atmosphere have raised a tremendous research interest in fields of optoelectronics, anticounterfeiting labeling, biosensing, and bioimaging. However, for practical applications in life and health fields, some fundamental requirements such as biocompatibility and biodegradability are still challenging for conventional inorganic and aromatic&#8208;based stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP systems. Herein, an edible excipient, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose (SCC), of which UOP properties exhibit intrinsically multistimuli responses to excited wavelength, pressure, and moisture, is reported. Impressively, as a UOP probe, SCC enables nondestructive detection of hardness with superb contrast (signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio up to 120), while exhibiting a response sensitivity to moisture that is more than 5.0 times higher than that observed in conventional fluorescence. Additionally, its applicability for hardness monitoring and high&#8208;moisture warning for tablets containing a moisture&#8208;sensitive drug, with the quality of the drug being determinable through the naked&#8208;eye visible UOP, is demonstrated. This work not only elucidates the reason for stimulative corresponding properties in SCC but also makes a major step forward in extending the potential applications of stimuli&#8208;responsive UOP materials in manufacturing high&#8208;quality and safe medicine.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Photovoltaics Enabled by Robust Silver Nanowires/S&#8208;PH1000 Hybrid Transparent Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, superior stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability are developed. The STEs enable intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) a remarkable PCE of 16.32% and commendable stretchability. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrode.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic photovoltaics (is&#8208;OPVs) hold significant promise for integration into self&#8208;powered wearable electronics. However, their potential is hindered by the lack of sufficient consistency between optoelectronic and mechanical properties. This is primarily due to the limited availability of stretchable transparent electrodes (STEs) that possess both high conductivity and stretchability. Here, a hybrid STE with exceptional conductivity, stretchability, and thermal stability is presented. Specifically, STEs are composed of the modified PH1000 (referred to as S&#8208;PH1000) and silver nanowires (AgNWs). The S&#8208;PH1000 endows the STE with good stretchability and smoothens the surface, while the AgNWs enhance the charge transport. The resulting hybrid STEs enable is&#8208;OPVs to a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.32%, positioning them among the top&#8208;performing is&#8208;OPVs. With 10% elastomer, the devices retain 82% of the initial PCE after 500 cycles at 20% strain. Additionally, OPVs equipped with these STEs exhibit superior thermal stability compared to those using indium tin oxide electrodes, maintaining 75% of the initial PCE after annealing at 85&#160;&#176;C for 390 h. The findings underscore the suitability of the designed hybrid electrodes for efficient and stable is&#8208;OPVs, offering a promising avenue for the future application of OPVs.

PVDF@PEI core&#8211;shell nanofibers are developed via symmetry&#8208;breaking design for efficient radiative cooling. The membranes show high thermal stability, hydrophobicity, UV protection, fluorescence enhancement, and breathability, enabling 8&#160;&#176;C daytime cooling. This innovation advances wearables and multifunctional materials research.








Abstract
Radiative cooling technology, which is renowned for its ability to dissipate heat without energy consumption, has garnered immense interest. However, achieving high performance, multifunctionality, and smart integration while addressing challenges such as film thickness and enhancing anisotropic light reflection remains challenging. In this study, a core&#8211;shell composite nanofiber, PVDF@PEI, is introduced and designed primarily from a symmetry&#8208;breaking perspective to develop highly efficient radiative cooling materials. Using a combination of solvent&#8208;induced phase separation (EIPS) inverse spinning and (aggregation) self&#8208;assembly methods (EISA or EIAA) and coaxial electrostatic spinning (ES), superconformal surface anisotropic porous nanofiber membranes are fabricated. These membranes exhibit exceptional thermal stability (up to 210&#160;&#176;C), high hydrophobicity (contact angle of 126&#176;), robust UV protection (exceeding 99%), a fluorescence multiplication effect (with a 0.6% increase in fluorescence quantum efficiency), and good breathability. These properties enable the material to excel in a wide range of application scenarios. Moreover, this material achieved a remarkable daytime cooling temperature of 8&#160;&#176;C. The development of this fiber membrane offers significant advancements in the field of wearables and the multifunctionality of materials, paving new paths for future research and innovation.

         <title>Crystalline Texture Reengineering of Zinc Powder&#8208;Based Fibrous Anode for Remarkable Mechano&#8208;Electrochemical Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wet&#8208;spinning technique is utilized to fabricate Zn@CNTs fiber for anode of fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery with remarkable electrochemical performance after textural reengineering via thermal treatment. Fibrous Zn&#8208;ion battery equipped with derived fiber anode showcase exceptional chemical stability and fatigue resistance after long&#8208;term fibrous battery deformation.








Abstract
The challenge of inadequate mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability in rechargeable fibrous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (FZIBs) has emerged as a critical challenge for their broad applications. Traditional rigid Zn wires struggle to maintain a stable electrochemical interface when subjected to external mechanical stress. To address this issue, a wet&#8208;spinning technique has been developed to fabricate Zn powder based fibrous anode, while carbon nanotubes (CNTs) introduced to enhance the spinnability of Zn powder dispersion. The followed annealing treatment has been conducted to reengineer the Zn crystalline texture with CNTs assisted surface tension regulation to redirect (002) crystallographic textural formation. The thus&#8208;derived annealed Zn@CNTs fiber demonstrates great mechano&#8208;electrochemical stability after a long&#8208;term bending and electrochemical process. The fabricated FZIB demonstrates a remarkable durability, surpassing 800&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, with a marginal voltage hysteresis increase of 21.7&#160;mV even after 100 twisting cycles under 180 degree twisting angle. The assembled FZIB full cell displays an 88.6% capacity retention even after a long cycle of a series of bending, knotting, and straightening deformation. It has been also woven into a 200&#160;cm2 size textile to demonstrate its capability to integrate into smart textiles.

         <title>Systemic Multifunctional Nanovaccines for Potent Personalized Immunotherapy of Acute Myeloid Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. This study develops systemic nanovaccines consisting of tumor cell lysate and dual adjuvants muramyl dipeptide and CpG (MCA&#8208;NV) to induce strong, durable, and broad anti&#8208;AML immunity. Intravenous infusion of nanovaccines substantially outperforms subcutaneous administration and cures 78% of AML&#8208;bearing mice. MCA&#8208;NV provides a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against HM.









Abstract
Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable.

&lt;p&gt;Hematological malignancies (HM) like acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are often intractable. This study develops systemic nanovaccines consisting of tumor cell lysate and dual adjuvants muramyl dipeptide and CpG (MCA-NV) to induce strong, durable, and broad anti-AML immunity. Intravenous infusion of nanovaccines substantially outperforms subcutaneous administration and cures 78% of AML-bearing mice. MCA-NV provides a personalized immunotherapeutic strategy against HM.

         <title>Above&#8208;Room&#8208;Temperature Ferroelectricity and Giant Second Harmonic Generation in 1D vdW NbOI3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 1D vdW ferroelectric NbOI3 nanowires possess a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt; &#160;450&#160;K. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant second harmonic generation (SHG) effect with a susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa.








Abstract
The realization of spontaneous ferroelectricity down to the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) limit is both fundamentally intriguing and practically appealing for high&#8208;density ferroelectric and nonlinear photonics. However, the 1D vdW ferroelectric materials are not discovered experimentally yet. Here, the first 1D vdW ferroelectric compound NbOI3 with a high Curie temperature TC&#160;&gt;&#160;450&#160;K and giant second harmonic generation (SHG) is reported. The 1D crystalline chain structure of the NbOI3 is revealed by cryo&#8208;electron microscopy, whereas the 1D ferroelectric order originated from the Nb displacement along the Nb&#8208;O chain (b&#8208;axis) is confirmed via obvious electrical and ferroelectric hysteresis loops. Impressively, NbOI3 exhibits a giant SHG susceptibility up to 1572&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 at a fundamental wavelength of 810&#160;nm, and a further enhanced SHG susceptibility of 5582&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1 under the applied hydrostatic pressure of 2.06&#160;GPa. Combing in situ pressure&#8208;dependent X&#8208;ray diffraction, Raman spectra measurements, and first&#8208;principles calculations, it is demonstrated that the O atoms shift along the Nb&#9472;O atomic chain under compression, which can lead to the increased Baur distortion of [NbO2I4] octahedra, and hence induces the enhancement of SHG. This work provides a 1D vdW ferroelectric system for developing novel ferroelectronic and photonic devices.

         <title>Water&#8208;Enhancing Gels Exhibiting Heat&#8208;Activated Formation of Silica Aerogels for Protection of Critical Infrastructure During Catastrophic Wildfire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetic polymer&#8208;particle hydrogels are developed as sprayable water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels that transition into thermally insulative silica aerogels upon heat activation. These hydrogels exhibit superior viscoelastic properties, strong substrate adherence, and dramatically enhanced fire protection compared to commercial gels. This innovation significantly advances water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels, offering robust protection for critical infrastructure and homes during wildfires, thereby markedly improving wildfire prevention and mitigation strategies.








Abstract
A promising strategy to address the pressing challenges with wildfire, particularly in the wildland&#8208;urban interface (WUI), involves developing new approaches for preventing and controlling wildfire within wildlands. Among sprayable fire&#8208;retardant materials, water&#8208;enhancing gels have emerged as exceptionally effective for protecting civil infrastructure. They possess favorable wetting and viscoelastic properties that reduce the likelihood of ignition, maintaining strong adherence to a wide array of surfaces after application. Although current water&#8208;enhancing hydrogels effectively maintain surface wetness by creating a barricade, they rapidly desiccate and lose efficacy under high heat and wind typical of wildfire conditions. To address this limitation, unique biomimetic hydrogel materials from sustainable cellulosic polymers crosslinked by colloidal silica particles are developed that exhibit ideal viscoelastic properties and facile manufacturing. Under heat activation, the hydrogel transitions into a highly porous and thermally insulative silica aerogel coating in situ, providing a robust protective layer against ignition of substrates, even when the hydrogel fire suppressant becomes completely desiccated. By confirming the mechanical properties, substrate adherence, and enhanced substrate protection against fire, these heat&#8208;activatable biomimetic hydrogels emerge as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation water&#8208;enhancing fire suppressants. These advancements have the potential to dramatically improve the ability to protect homes and critical infrastructure during wildfire.

         <title>Synthesis of Heteromorphic Bi2WO6 Films With an Interpenetrate 1D/2D Network Structure for Efficient and Stable Photocatalytic Degradation of VOCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi2WO6 (BWO) film with a network structure of 2D (NSs) penetrated with 1D nanofibers (NFs) is reported. BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO NFs during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves, which can rapidly degrade acetaldehyde under visible light and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decays.








Abstract
2D layered Bi2WO6 (BWO) is a widely used attractive photocatalyst for degrading VOCs, but the low visible&#8208;light utilization and the easy stacking 2D nanosheets&#160;(NSs) limit photocatalysis efficiency and stability. Here, inspired by Eucalyptus, a synergistic strategy of multiscale domain&#8208;confinement and electrostatic force action, based on electrospinning is proposed, for fabricating a heteromorphic BWO photocatalyst. It is found that BWO NSs can grow radially in an orderly spaced arrangement along BWO nanofibers (NFs) during sintering, thereby forming 1D/2D BWO junctions like eucalyptus leaves. This interpenetrating 1D/2D network structure not only solves the easy stacking problem of BWO NSs but also selectively exposes the {010} crystal planes that exhibit efficient hole oxidation. In addition, this peculiar structure enriches electrons at the 1D/2D interface to avoid carrier recombination, thus improving the photocatalytic activity. The photocatalyst material with a reduced bandgap width from 2.56 to 2.49&#160;eV can rapidly degrade 100% of acetaldehyde under visible light without using sacrificial agents and photosensitizers and shows superior stability for eight cycles without any decay. This study provides a feasible method to synthesize an efficient and stable BWO photocatalyst.

         <title>Porous Polymeric Electrodes for Electrochemical Carbon Dioxide Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas&#8208;electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow&#8208;through mode for high&#8208;efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost&#8208;effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.








Abstract
Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro&#8208;swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization. However, current electrodes with limited gas transport present a major barrier that hinders their practical implementation. Herein, porous polymeric electrodes are developed to effectively enhance CO2 transport without the need for additional gas diffusion conduits. Such all&#8208;in&#8208;one porous electrodes also enable more accessible redox active sites (e.g., quinones) for CO2 sorption, leading to an increased materials utilization efficiency of &#8776;90%. A continuous flow&#8208;through carbon capture and release operation with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability under practical working conditions is further demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Redox-active porous polymeric electrodes (PPEs) are developed with promoted advective gas transport and enhanced gas-electrolyte contact adsorption area in a flow-through mode for high-efficiency carbon dioxide capture. This strategy offers new possibilities for manufacturing scalable and cost-effective electrodes and is anticipated to be transferable to general electrochemically mediated separation technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Carbon capture is a promising technology to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions to achieve net carbon neutrality. Electro-swing reactive adsorption has emerged as an attractive approach for sustainable decarbonization. However, current electrodes with limited gas transport present a major barrier that hinders their practical implementation. Herein, porous polymeric electrodes are developed to effectively enhance CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; transport without the need for additional gas diffusion conduits. Such all-in-one porous electrodes also enable more accessible redox active sites (e.g., quinones) for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; sorption, leading to an increased materials utilization efficiency of &#8776;90%. A continuous flow-through carbon capture and release operation with high Faradaic efficiency and excellent stability under practical working conditions is further demonstrated. Together with low cost and robust mechanical properties, the as-developed porous polymeric electrodes highlight the potential to advance the future implementation of electrochemical separation technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stiffness and Interface Engineered Soft Electronics with Large&#8208;Scale Robust Deformability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By simultaneously regulating stiffness and enhancing interfacial binding force, this work provides an efficient path to realize robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronic skins. Stiff and elastic areas of the designed substrate have nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic devices and liquid metal interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
Skin&#8208;like stretchable electronics emerge as promising human&#8211;machine interfaces but are challenged by the paradox between superior electronic property and reliable mechanical deformability. Here, a general strategy is reported for establishing robust large&#8208;scale deformable electronics by effectively isolating strains and strengthening interfaces. A copolymer substrate is designed to consist of mosaic stiff and elastic areas with nearly four orders of magnitudes modulus contrast and cross&#8208;linked interfaces. Electronic functional devices and stretchable liquid metal (LM) interconnects are conformally attached at the stiff and elastic areas, respectively, through hydrogen bonds. As a result, functional devices are completely isolated from strains, and resistances of LM conductors change by less than one time when the substrate is deformed by up to 550%. By this strategy, solar cells, wireless charging antenna, supercapacitors, and light&#8208;emitting diodes are integrated into a self&#8208;powered electronic skin that can laminate on the human body and exhibit stable performances during repeated multimode deformations, demonstrating an efficient path for realizing highly deformable energy autonomous soft electronics.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Responsive Hybrid System Achieves Cascade&#8208;Augmented Antitumor Immunity via Genetic Engineering of Both Bacteria and Tumor Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;responsive genetic engineering of both bacteria and tumor cells is achieved by a hybrid therapeutic platform consisting of genetically engineered bacteria and photothermal nanoparticles for tumor&#8208;targeted and augmented immunotherapy of melanoma. A synergistic antitumor effect is achieved during the process of antioncogene transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated expression of the therapeutic immunomodulator.








Abstract
The combination of nanoparticles and tumor&#8208;targeting bacteria for cancer immunotherapy can overcome the shortcomings of poor nanoparticle accumulation, limited penetration, and restricted distribution. However, it remains a great challenge for the hybrid system to improve therapeutic efficacy through the simultaneous and controllable regulation of immune cells and tumor cells. Herein, a hybrid therapeutic platform is rationally designed to achieve immune cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy. To construct the hybrids, photothermal nanoparticles responsive to light in the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) region are conjugated onto the surface of engineered bacteria through pH&#8208;responsive Schiff base bonds. Taking advantage of the hypoxia targeting and deep penetration characteristics of the bacteria, the hybrids can accumulate at tumor sites. Then nanoparticles detach from the bacteria to realize genetic engineering of tumor cells, which induces tumor cell apoptosis and down&#8208;regulate the expression of programmed cell death ligand 1 to alleviate immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The mild photothermal heating can not only induce tumor&#8208;associated antigen release, but also trigger sustainable expression of cytokine interleukin&#8208;2. Notably, a synergistic antitumor effect is achieved between the process of p53 transfection and NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated genetic engineering of bacteria. This work proposes a facile strategy for the construction of hybrid system to achieve cascade&#8208;augmented cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Photothermal Catalytic Reduction and Bone Tissue Engineering Towards a Three&#8208;in&#8208;One Therapy Strategy for Osteosarcoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A triple&#8208;function 3D&#8208;printed bioscaffold equipped with CMB nanowheel crystals (CMB@BG) is designed and engineered for the comprehensive treatment of osteosarcoma. Due to their photothermally enhanced ROS&#8208;scavenging capacity, CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit exceptional NIR&#8208;II photothermal&#8208;conversion efficiency, osteogenic induction activity, and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities. Therefore, they are regarded as an ideal therapeutic strategy that balances clearance, protection, and repair for osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma is one of the most dreadful bone neoplasms in young people, necessitating the development of innovative therapies that can effectively eliminate tumors while minimizing damage to limb function. An ideal therapeutic strategy should possess three essential capabilities: antitumor effects, tissue&#8208;protective properties, and the ability to enhance osteogenesis. In this study, self&#8208;assembled Ce&#8208;substituted molybdenum blue (CMB) nanowheel crystals are synthesized and loaded onto 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glass (CMB@BG) scaffolds to develop a unique three&#8208;in&#8208;one treatment approach for osteosarcoma. The CMB@BG scaffolds exhibit outstanding photothermally derived tumor ablation within the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II window due to the surface plasmon resonance properties of the CMB nanowheel crystals. Furthermore, the photothermally synergistic catalytic effect of CMB promotes the rapid scavenging of reactive oxygen species caused by excessive heat, thereby suppressing inflammation and protecting surrounding tissues. The CMB@BG scaffolds possess pro&#8208;proliferation and pro&#8208;differentiation capabilities that efficiently accelerate bone regeneration within bone defects. Altogether, the CMB@BG scaffolds that combine highly efficient tumor ablation, tissue protection based on anti&#8208;inflammatory mechanisms, and enhanced osteogenic ability are likely to be a point&#8208;to&#8208;point solution for the comprehensive therapeutic needs of osteosarcoma.

         <title>An Efficient Trifunctional Spinel&#8208;Based Electrode for Oxygen Reduction/Evolution Reactions and Nonoxidative Ethane Dehydrogenation on Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here a novel spinel&#8208;based composite of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO)&#8208;Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8208;CO, 8:2 in mass ratio) oxide is reported as a trifunctional electrode for electricity generation and ethylene electro&#8208;production on protonic ceramic electrochemical cells.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (PCECs) have received considerable attention as they can directly generate electricity and/or produce chemicals. Development of the electrodes with the trifunctionalities of oxygen reduction/evolution and nonoxidative ethane dehydrogenation is yet challenging. Here these findings are reported in the design of trifunctional electrodes for PCECs with a detailed composition of Mn0.9Cs0.1Co2O4&#8208;&#948; (MCCO) and Co3O4 (CO) (MCCO&#8211;CO, 8:2 mass ratio). At 600&#160;&#176;C, the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode exhibits a low area&#8208;specific resistance of 0.382 &#937; cm2 and reasonable stability for &#8776;105&#160;h with no obvious degradation. The single cell with the MCCO&#8211;CO electrode shows an encouraging peak power density of 1.73&#160;W cm&#8722;2 in the fuel cell (FC) mode and a current density of &#8208;3.93 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.3&#160;V in the electrolysis cell (EC) mode at 700&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, the MCCO&#8211;CO cell displays promising operational stability in FC mode (223&#160;h), EC mode (209&#160;h), and reversible cycling stability (52 cycles, 208&#160;h) at 650&#160;&#176;C. The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H2 production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.

The MCCO&#8211;CO single cell shows an encouraging ethane&#160;conversion to ethylene (with a conversion of 40.3% and selectivity of 94%) and excellent H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates of 4.65&#160;mL min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.5&#160;V and 700&#160;&#176;C, respectively, with reasonable Faradaic efficiencies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enriched Oxygen Coverage Localized within Ir Atomic Grids for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>

Atomic grid structure with high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10 atoms per nm2) on MnO2&#8211;x support realizes co&#8208;catalytic Ir&#8211;Mn interaction in water oxidation process, involving enriched oxygen coverage driven by Mn&#8208;Ov coordination defects to cooperate with highly electrophilic Ir&#8211;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; species, which facilitates intensive O&#8211;O radical direct coupling within the grids for performance enhancement.








Abstract
Inefficient active site utilization of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts have limited the energy efficiency of proton exchange membrane (PEM) water electrolysis. Here, an atomic grid structure is demonstrated composed of high&#8208;density Ir sites (&#8776;10&#160;atoms per nm2) on reactive MnO2&#8211;x support which mediates oxygen coverage&#8208;enhanced OER process. Experimental characterizations verify the low&#8208;valent Mn species with decreased oxygen coordination in MnO2&#8211;x exert a pivotal impact in the enriched oxygen coverage on the surface during OER process, and the distributed Ir atomic grids, where highly electrophilic Ir&#9472;O(II&#8208;&#948;)&#8722; bonds proceed rapidly, render intense nucleophilic attack of oxygen radicals. Thereby, this metal&#8208;support cooperation achieves ultra&#8208;low overpotentials of 166&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 283&#160;mV at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, together with a striking mass activity which is 380 times higher than commercial IrO2 at 1.53&#160;V. Moreover, its high OER performance also markedly surpasses the commercial Ir black catalyst in PEM electrolyzers with long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Bio&#8208;inspired Mechanically Responsive Smart Windows for Visible and Near&#8208;Infrared Multiwavelength Spectral Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A feasible layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly strategy is proposed toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for VIS and NIR multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows. The excellent mechanical and optical cycling stability of the composite film provide a favorable basis for their practical applications. Furthermore, these spectral selective and dynamic smart windows will provide suitable solutions for the decarbonization of buildings.








Abstract
Mechanochromic light control technology that can dynamically regulate solar irradiation is recognized as one of the leading candidates for energy&#8208;saving windows. However, the lack of spectrally selective modulation ability still hinders its application for different scenarios or individual needs. Here, inspired by the generation of structure color and color change of living organisms, a simple layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly approach toward large&#8208;area fabricating mechanically responsive film for visible and near&#8208;infrared multiwavelength spectral modulation smart windows is reported here. The assembled SiO2 nanoparticles&#160;and W18O49 nanowires enable the film with an optical modulation rate of up to 42.4% at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm and 18.4% for the near&#8208;infrared region, separately, and the typical composite film under 50% stretching shows &#8776;41.6% modulation rate at the wavelength of 550&#160;nm with NIR modulation rate less than 2.7%. More importantly, the introduction of the multilayer assembly structure not only optimizes the film's optical modulation but also enables the film with high stability during 100&#160;000 stretching cycles. A cooling effect of 21.3 and 6.9 &#176;C for the blackbody and air inside a model house in the real environmental application is achieved. This approach provides theoretical and technical support for the new mechanochromic energy&#8208;saving windows.

         <title>Multifunctional Metamaterial with Reconfigurable Electromagnetic Scattering Properties for Advanced Stealth and Adaptive Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bistable condition of the curved beam and design is studied with wave&#8208;absorbing metamaterials. So it has the bistable characteristic and the ability to absorb bandwidth switching. The absorbing mechanism is explained through the macroscopic and microscopic levels. The adjustable form is enriched with digital coding and applied to the satellite configuration to realize the reconstruction function of electromagnetic scattering properties.








Abstract
The rapid development of radar detection systems has led to an increased sensitivity to the electromagnetic (EM) scattering properties of detected targets. Flexible and adaptable EM scattering properties significantly enhance the survivability of battlefield weapons. This paper presents the design of a novel multifunctional metamaterial with reconfigurable EM scattering properties based on a bistable curved beam. In addition to the cushioning and energy absorption properties of curved beams, the metamaterial achieves more than 90% EM absorption in the frequency range of 2.17&#8211;17.31&#160;GHz, with a relative thickness of only 0.09&#955;L. The bistable nature of the metamaterial allows it to switch between different states. Moreover, combined with the digital coding, this metamaterial can continuously adjust the absorbing bandwidth and further enhance the EM absorption rate within a specific frequency band range. If applied to satellite configurations, the developed metamaterial significantly reduces the radar cross section and offers potential applications in reconfiguring EM scattering properties, when applied to satellite configurations. By actively controller and reconstructing the EM scattering properties at certain frequency points, the metamaterial can achieve camouflage, providing innovative solutions for future stealth technology, electronic countermeasures, and deception jamming in radar detection.

         <title>Water&#8208;Templated Growth of Interfacial Superglue Polymers for Tunable Thin Films and In Situ Fluid Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
WRAPPINGS is an eco&#8208;friendly concept that delivers thin poly(cyanoacrylate) films with precisely engineered properties. Exposing a water surface containing cationic surfactants to superglue vapors results in a film with tailored thickness, shape, and color. Using drops and bubbles as templates for film growth, the in situ packaging of chemical and biological liquid cargos and the encapsulation of gases is demonstrated.








Abstract
Thin polymer films (TPFs) are indispensable elements in numerous technologies ranging from liquid encapsulation to biotechnology to electronics. However, their production typically relies on wet chemistry involving organic solvents or chemical vapor deposition, necessitating elaborate equipment and often harsh conditions. Here, an eco&#8208;friendly, fast, and facile synthesis of water&#8208;templated interfacial polymers based on cyanoacrylates (superglues, CAs) that yield thin films with tailored properties is demonstrated. Specifically, by exposing a cationic surfactant&#8208;laden water surface to cyanoacrylate vapors, surfactant&#8208;modulated anionic polymerization produces a manipulable thin polymer film with a thickness growth rate of 8&#160;nm&#160;min&#8722;1. Furthermore, the shape and color of the film are precisely controlled by the polymerization kinetics, wetting conditions, and/or exposure to patterned light. Using various interfaces as templates for film growth, including the free surface of drops and soap bubbles, the developed method advantageously enables in situ packaging of chemical and biological cargos in liquid phase as well as the encapsulation of gases within solidified bubbles. Simple, versatile, and biocompatible, this technology constitutes a potent platform for programmable coating and soft/smart encapsulation of fluids.

         <title>Uncovering the Intrinsic High Fracture Toughness of Titanium via Lowered Oxygen Impurity Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here it is revealed that the low&#8208;oxygen titanium (Ti) has an intrinsic fracture toughness of 255 MPa m1/2. The low oxygen concentration promotes deformation twinning, and the numerous twin boundaries further stimulate the &#12296;c+a&#12297; slip at the crack tip. The operation of these two &#12296;c&#12297;&#8208;axis deformation modes enhances the uniform deformation abilities, resulting in a remarkable leap in fracture resistance of Ti.








Abstract
Titanium (Ti) and its alloys are known to exhibit room&#8208;temperature fracture toughness below 130 MPa m1/2, only about one half of the best austenitic stainless steels. It is purported that this is not the best possible fracture resistance of Ti, but a result of oxygen impurities that sensitively retard the activities of plasticity carriers in this hexagonal close&#8208;packed metal. By a reduction of oxygen content from the 0.14&#160;wt% in commercial purity Ti to 0.02&#160;wt%, the mode&#8208;&#921; fracture toughness of the low&#8208;oxygen Ti is measured to be as high as KJIc &#8776; 255 MPa m1/2, corresponding to J&#8208;integral&#8208;based crack&#8208;initiation toughness of up to JIc &#8776; 537&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. This extraordinary toughness, reported here for the first time for pure Ti, places Ti among the toughest known materials. The intrinsic high fracture resistance is attributed to the profuse plastic deformation in a significantly enlarged plastic zone, rendered by the pronounced deformation twinning ahead of the crack tip along with ample twin&#8208;stimulated &#12296;c+a&#12297; dislocation activities, in the absence of impeding oxygen. Controlling the content of a property&#8208;controlling impurity thus holds the promise to be a readily applicable strategy to reach for unprecedented damage tolerance in some other structural alloys.

         <title>SonoPrint: Acoustically Assisted Volumetric 3D Printing for Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SonoPrint merges sound energy with volumetric printing to create composite materials with aligned reinforcement patterning. This innovative 3D printing technique embeds particles such as glass, metal, and polystyrene into photosensitive resin, forming intricate motifs and mechanically tunable geometries. Completing prints in minutes, SonoPrint enhances structural properties and advances applications in biohybrid robots, tissue engineering, and composite fabrication, broadening the horizons of volumetric printing.








Abstract
Advances in additive manufacturing in composites have transformed aerospace, medical devices, tissue engineering, and electronics. A key aspect of enhancing properties of 3D&#8208;printed objects involves fine&#8208;tuning the material by embedding and orienting reinforcement within the structure. Existing methods for orienting these reinforcements are limited by pattern types, alignment, and particle characteristics. Acoustics offers a versatile method to control the particles independent of their size, geometry, and charge, enabling intricate pattern formations. However, integrating acoustics into 3D printing has been challenging due to the scattering of the acoustic field between polymerized layers and unpolymerized resin, resulting in unwanted patterns. To address this challenge, SonoPrint, an innovative acoustically assisted volumetric 3D printer is developed that enables simultaneous reinforcement patterning and printing of the entire structure. SonoPrint generates mechanically tunable composite geometries by embedding reinforcement particles, such as microscopic glass, metal, and polystyrene, within the fabricated structure. This printer employs a standing wave field to create targeted particle motifs&#8208;including parallel lines, radial lines, circles, rhombuses, hexagons, and polygons&#8208;directly in the photosensitive resin, completing the print in just a few minutes. SonoPrint enhances structural properties and promises to advance volumetric printing, unlocking applications in tissue engineering, biohybrid robots, and composite fabrication.

         <title>Engineering Supramolecular Hydrogels via Reversible Photoswitching of Cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;Spiropyran Complexation Stoichiometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex is designed to exhibit fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 in response to UV and blue light. Such photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light.








Abstract
The integration of photoswitchable supramolecular units into hydrogels allows for spatiotemporal control over their nanoscale topological network and macroscale properties using light. Nevertheless, the current availability of photoswitchable supramolecular interactions for the development of such materials remains limited. Here, the molecular design of a novel photoswitchable cucurbit[8]uril&#8208;spiropyran host&#8211;guest complex exhibiting fast and reversible switching of binding ratios between 1:2 and 1:1 is reported. Photoswitchable complexation stoichiometries are rationally exploited as (de)crosslinking units in multiple polymers for the design of supramolecular hydrogels displaying highly dynamic and switchable features that are spatiotemporally controlled by light. The hydrogels exhibit rapid reversible mechanical softening&#8208;hardening upon alternating irradiation with blue and UV light, which is used to significantly accelerate and improve the efficiency of self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;remolding of hydrogels. Furthermore, spiropyran endows such materials with unique reversible photochromic properties for reproducible patterning/erasing and information storage. Using a dual&#8208;light&#8208;assisted extrusion process, meter&#8208;scale hydrogel fibers with enhanced structural integrity and photoswitchable ionic conductivity are constructed and woven into various slidable knots and fluorescent shapes. This work represents an innovative molecular design strategy for advancing the development of spatiotemporally engineered supramolecular hydrogels using light and opens avenues for their prospective applications in dynamic materials and adaptive systems.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanomodulators With Synergism of Photothermal Therapy and Vessel Normalization for Boosting Potent Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanomodulator Tm@PDA&#8208;GA with homologous targeting is developed for boosting potent anticancer immunity. Especially Tm@PDA&#8208;GA inhibits HSPs expression for chemo&#8208;photothermal synergetic anti&#8208;tumor and increases ICD to promote the maturation of dendritic cells. Additionally, it normalizes the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration. So Tm@PDA&#8208;GA combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 can effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis.








Abstract
Combination therapy using photothermal therapy (PTT) and immunotherapy is one of the most promising approaches for eliciting host immune responses to ablate tumors. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited due to inefficient immune cell infiltration and cellular immune responses. In this study, a biomimetic immunostimulatory nanomodulator, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA (4T1 membrane@polydopamine&#8208;gambogic acid), with homologous targeting is developed. The 4T1 membrane (Tm) coating reduced immunogenicity and facilitated uptake of Tm@PDA&#8208;GA by tumor cells. Polydopamine (PDA) as a drug carrier can induce PTT under near&#8208;infrared ray (NIR) irradiation and immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate dendritic cells (DCs). Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA on&#8208;demand released gambogic acid (GA) in an acidic tumor microenvironment, inhibiting the expression of heat shock proteins (HSPs) for synergetic chemo&#8208;photothermal anti&#8208;tumor activity and increasing the ICD of 4T1 cells. More importantly, GA can normalize the vessels via HIF&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF inhibition to enhance immune infiltration and alleviate hypoxia stress. Thus, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA induced ICD, activated DCs, stimulated cytotoxic T cells, and suppressed Tregs. Moreover, Tm@PDA&#8208;GA is combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to further augment the tumor immune response and effectively suppress tumor growth and lung metastasis. In conclusion, biomaterial&#8208;mediated PTT combined with vessel normalization is a promising strategy for effective immunotherapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC).

         <title>Direct Chiral Discrimination with NMR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) elucidates molecular structures down to the atomic level. However, only with an auxiliary molecule, it is currently possible to distinguish the handedness of enantiomers directly with NMR. NMR is normally blind to chirality. A newly developed method now allows the distinction of enantiomers, just by using a standard NMR instrument, and without adulteration of the sample under investigation.








Abstract
Unaided nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is considered incapable of distinguishing enantiomers. However, as first derived by A.D. Buckingham, the tensor coupling the electric and magnetic dipoles is space&#8208;dependent, which varies according to the molecular structure, hence, would be different for two enantiomers. Exploiting the odd&#8208;parity coupling tensor, a new variant of a double&#8208;resonant radiofrequency (RF) NMR detector is developed, which is sensitive to both electric and magnetic dipoles. Using the detector, a new method for liquid&#8208;state NMR is developed and elaborated, with which two enantiomers are successfully discriminated.

         <title>Enhanced Self&#8211;Assembly and Spontaneous Separation for Ultrathin, Air&#8210;Floating Graphene Macrofilms and their Application in Ultrasensitive In&#8208;Site Growth Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8211;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8210;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled graphene films at air&#8208;liquid interface have great potential for multiple applications. However, the large size and ultrathin thickness for graphene&#8208;based films are hardly achieved simultaneously because of poor assembly ability of graphene oxide (GO) and cautious film transfer process (FTP). Herein, the ethanol&#8208;based binary solution with supramolecular clusters and weak polarity is introduced to enhance the assembly performance of GO. In this regime, GO film is formed within 52 s, and its formation temperature can be as low as &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, the attractive force between the formed GO film and this binary solution is 62% lower than that between GO film and traditional aqueous solution. On this basis, for the first time a spontaneous separation of the self&#8208;assembled GO film from solution is reported, and the air&#8210;floating graphene films (AGFs) with nanoscale thickness and centimeter&#8208;scale diameter are prepared without FTP. By means of this separation behavior, the in situ growth AGFs sensors are fabricated, and they express fast response and ultrahigh sensitivity to imperceptible change in temperature and disturbances that are hardly recognized by common sensors. Therefore, a new accessible strategy is demonstrated to prepare ultrathin graphene macrofilms, which can be the excellent candidates for multifunctional, ultrasensitive sensors.

         <title>Densification of Cathode/Electrolyte Interphase to Enhance Reversibility of LiCoO2 at 4.65&#160;V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A progressively reinforced cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on Z&#8208;LCO, i.e. the fluorination of Zr&#9472;O and densification of CEI layer driven by the chemical reaction between ZrOxFy and LiF, greatly reinforcing the toughness of CEI containing inorganic species. Consequently, Z&#8208;LCO achieve an enhanced and reversible O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition and excellent electrochemical performance at 4.6/4.65 V.








Abstract
For LiCoO2 (LCO) operated beyond 4.55&#160;V (vs Li/Li+), it usually suffers from severe surface degradation. Constructing a robust cathode/electrolyte interphase (CEI) is effective to alleviate the above issues, however, the correlated mechanisms still remain vague. Herein, a progressively reinforced CEI is realized via constructing Zr&#9472;O deposits (ZrO2 and Li2ZrO3) on LCO surface (i.e., Z&#8208;LCO). Upon cycle, these Zr&#9472;O deposits can promote the decomposition of LiPF6, and progressively convert to the highly dispersed Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species. In particular, the chemical reaction between LiF and Zr&#9472;O&#9472;F species further leads to the densification of CEI, which greatly reinforces its toughness and conductivity. Combining the robust CEI and thin surface rock&#8208;salt layer of Z&#8208;LCO, several benefits are achieved, including stabilizing the surface lattice oxygen, facilitating the interface Li+ transport kinetics, and enhancing the reversibility of O3/H1&#8208;3 phase transition, etc. As a result, the Z&#8208;LCO||Li cells exhibit a high capacity retention of 84.2% after 1000 cycles in 3&#8211;4.65&#160;V, 80.9% after 1500 cycles in 3&#8211;4.6&#160;V, and a high rate capacity of 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 16 C (1 C&#160;=&#160;200&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1). This work provides a new insight for developing advanced LCO cathodes.

         <title>Ultralong K0.5Mn0.75PS3 Nanowires Tailored by K&#8208;Ion Scissors for Extraordinary Sodium&#8208;Ion Storage</title>

The concept of &#8220;K&#8208;ion scissors&#8221; is proposed for the first time to achieve rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 nanowires with extraordinary sodium storage performance.








Abstract
1D&#160;layered nanowires (NWs) are expected to be excellent electrode materials due to their efficient electron/ion transport and strain/stress relaxation. However, it is a great challenge to synthesize layered NWs by a top&#8208;down synthetic route. Herein, ultralong 1D layered K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs (length: &gt;100&#160;&#181;m; diameter: &#8776;300&#160;nm) are synthesized for the first time using &#8220;K&#8208;ion chemical scissors&#8221;, whose excellent sodium storage performance originates from the bifunctional structural unit, ingeniously combining the alloying energy storage functional unit (P&#8722;P dimer) with the quasi&#8208;intercalated functional unit ([MnS3]4&#8722; framework). Stress&#8208;driven K&#8208;ion scissors achieve the rapid transformation of MnPS3 bulk to K0.5Mn0.75PS3 NWs with directed tailoring. Compared to MnPS3, the NWs exhibit enlarged interlayer spacing (9.32 &#197;), enhanced electronic conductivity (8.17&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;5 S m&#8722;1 vs 4.47&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10 S m&#8722;1), and high ionic conductivity (2.14 mS cm&#8722;1). As expected, the NWs demonstrate high capacity (709 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent cycling performance (&#8776;100% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1), ranking among metal thiophosphates. A quasi&#8208;topological intercalation mechanism of the NWs is revealed through further characterizations. This work expands the top&#8208;down synthesis approach and offers innovative insights for the cost&#8208;effective and large&#8208;scale fabrication of NWs with outstanding electrochemical performance.

         <title>Leidenfrost Effect&#8208;Induced Chaotic Vortex Flow for Efficient Mixing of Highly Viscous Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency mixing of viscous liquids in microfluidics manipulation is a long&#8208;standing challenge because of unfavorable diffusion kinetics. Here, a peculiar Leidenfrost phenomenon, which can achieve mixing of viscous droplets within several hundred ms due to internal vortex motion, is resorted to. This new mixing mechanism can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology.








Abstract
Efficiently mixing highly viscous liquids in microfluidic systems is appealing for green chemistry such as chemical synthesis and catalysis, but it is a long&#8208;standing challenge owing to the unfavorable diffusion kinetics. In this work, a new strategy is explored for mixing viscous droplets by harnessing a peculiar Leidenfrost state, where the substrate temperature is above the boiling point of the liquid without apparent liquid evaporation. Compared to the control experiment where the droplet stays at a similar temperature but in the contact boiling regime, the mixing time can be reduced significantly. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the liquid mixing originates from the chaotic convection flow in the Leidenfrost droplet, characterized by the internal vortex motion evidenced by the microscale visualization. A correlation between mixing time and droplet volume is also proposed, showing a good agreement with experimental results. It is further shown that Leidenfrost droplets can be used to synthesize nanoparticles of the desired morphology, and it is anticipated that this simple and scalable fabrication approach will find applications in the biological, pharmaceutical, and chemical industries.

         <title>Anisotropic Superprotonic Conduction in a Layered Single&#8208;Component Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework with Multiple In&#8208;Plane Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered single&#8208;component hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF), HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3, is prepared, which exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction via multiple in&#8208;plane open channels. A&#160;proton rectifier device is further demonstrated, highlighting the promise of HOFs as conducting media for ionic devices.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are promising proton conductive materials because of their inherent and abundant hydrogen&#8208;bonding sites. However, most superprotonic&#8208;conductive HOFs are constructed from multiple components to enable favorable framework architectures and structural integrity. In this contribution, layered HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 with a single component is synthesized and exfoliated. The exfoliated nanoplates exhibited anisotropic superprotonic conduction, with in&#8208;plane proton conductivities reaching 1.34&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2 S cm&#8722;1 at 296 K and 98% relative humidity (RH). This outperforms the previously reported single&#8208;component HOFs and is comparable with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multiple&#8208;component HOFs. The high and anisotropic proton conductive properties can be attributed to the efficient proton transport along multiple open channels parallel to their basal planes. Moreover, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state (ASS) proton rectifier device is demonstrated by combining HOF&#8208;TPB&#8208;A3 and a hydroxide ion&#8208;conducting layered double hydroxide (LDH). This work suggests that single&#8208;component HOFs with multiple open channels offer more opportunities as versatile platforms for proton conductors, making them promising candidates for conducting media in protonic devices.

         <title>All&#8208;in&#8208;One 2D Molecular Crystal Optoelectronic Synapse for Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Neuromorphic Visual System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pioneering all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2D molecular crystal (2DMC) optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive neuromorphic visual system is demonstrated. The synaptic phototransistor exhibits remarkable photoelectric performance and simulates biological synapse functions. The in&#8208;plane crystal anisotropy of 2DMC endows the synaptic phototransistor with polarization perception capabilities, which is successfully applied to noncontact fingerprint detection with a high recognition accuracy.








Abstract
Neuromorphic visual systems (NVSs) hold the potential to not only preserve but also enhance human visual capabilities. One such augmentation lies in harnessing polarization information from light reflected or scattered off surfaces like bees, which can disclose unique characteristics imperceptible to the human eyes. While creating polarization&#8208;sensitive optoelectronic synapses presents an intriguing avenue for equipping NVS with this capability, integrating functions like polarization sensitivity, photodetection, and synaptic operations into a singular device has proven challenging. This integration typically necessitates distinct functional components for each performance metric, leading to intricate fabrication processes and constraining overall performance. Herein, a pioneering linear polarized light sensitive synaptic organic phototransistor (OPT) based on 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs) with highly integrated, all&#8208;in&#8208;one functionality, is demonstrated. By leveraging the superior crystallinity and molecular thinness of 2DMC, the synaptic OPT exhibits comprehensive superior performance, including a linear dichroic ratio up to 3.85, a high responsivity of 1.47 &#215; 104 A W&#8722;1, and the adept emulation of biological synapse functions. A sophisticated application in noncontact fingerprint detection achieves a 99.8% recognition accuracy, further highlights its potential. The all&#8208;in&#8208;one 2DMC optoelectronic synapse for polarization&#8208;sensitive NVS marks a new era for intelligent perception systems.

         <title>A Biomimetic Autophagosomes&#8208;Based Nanovaccine Boosts Anticancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) personalized nanovaccine that integrates neoantigens sourced from tumor cell&#8208;derived autophagosomes, immunoadjuvants, and targeting nanovesicles to induce a potent tumor&#8208;specific immune response. The BAPs nanovaccine demonstrates significant efficacy in eradicating established tumors, providing comprehensive protection to mice against tumor rechallenges, and decreasing tumor incidence. This represents a highly versatile formulation for personalized cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
Personalized cancer vaccines based on tumor cell lysates offer promise for cancer immunotherapy yet fail to elicit a robust therapeutic effect due to the weak immunogenicity of tumor antigens. Autophagosomes, obtained from pleural effusions and ascites of cancer patients, have been identified as abundant reservoirs of tumor neoantigens that exhibit heightened immunogenicity. However, their potential as personalized cancer vaccines have been constrained by suboptimal lymphatic&#8208;targeting performances and challenges in antigen&#8208;presenting cell endocytosis. Here,a reinforced biomimetic autophagosome&#8208;based (BAPs) nanovaccine generated by precisely amalgamating autophagosome&#8208;derived neoantigens and two types of adjuvants capable of targeting lymph nodes is developed to potently elicit antitumor immunity. The redox&#8208;responsive BAPs facilitate cytosolic vaccine opening within antigen&#8208;presenting cells, thereby exposing adjuvants and antigens to stimulate a strong immune response. BAPs evoke broad&#8208;spectrum T&#8208;cell responses, culminating in the effective eradication of 71.4% of established tumors. Notably, BAPs vaccination triggers enduring T&#8208;cell responses that confer robust protection, with 100% of mice shielded against tumor rechallenge and a significant reduction in tumor incidence by 87.5%. Furthermore, BAPs synergize with checkpoint blockade therapy to inhibit tumor growth in the poorly immunogenic breast cancer model. The biomimetic approach presents a powerful nanovaccine formula with high versatility&#160;for personalized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Simultaneous Color&#8208; and Dose&#8208;Controlled Thiol&#8211;Ene Resins for Multimodulus 3D Printing with Programmable Interfacial Gradients</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high&#8208;resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color&#8208;selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain&#8208;growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step&#8208;growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively. This study provides composition&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationships to inform advanced manufacturing of next&#8208;generation multimaterial objects having a myriad of applications from healthcare to education.

&lt;p&gt;Exposing a novel multifunctional resin to different colors and intensities of light enables 3D printing of high-resolution objects with programmable stiffness gradients that are mimetic of structures found in nature.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Drawing inspiration from nature's own intricate designs, synthetic multimaterial structures have the potential to offer properties and functionality that exceed those of the individual components. However, several contemporary hurdles, from a lack of efficient chemistries to processing constraints, preclude the rapid and precise manufacturing of such materials. Herein, the development of a photocurable resin comprising color-selective initiators is reported, triggering disparate polymerization mechanisms between acrylate and thiol functionality. Exposure of the resin to UV light (365&#160;nm) leads to the formation of a rigid, highly crosslinked network via a radical chain-growth mechanism, while violet light (405&#160;nm) forms a soft, lightly crosslinked network via an anionic step-growth mechanism. The efficient photocurable resin is employed in multicolor digital light processing 3D printing to provide structures with moduli spanning over two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, local intensity (i.e., grayscale) control enables the formation of programmable stiffness gradients with &#8776;150&#215; change in modulus occurring across sharp (&#8776;200&#160;&#181;m) and shallow (&#8776;9&#160;mm) interfaces, mimetic of the human knee entheses and squid beaks, respectively. This study provides composition&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationships to inform advanced manufacturing of next-generation multimaterial objects having a myriad of applications from healthcare to education.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implantable Microneedle&#8208;Mediated Eradication of Postoperative Tumor Foci Mitigates Glioblastoma Relapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable and immunomodulatory microneedle (GMAN@CMN) is reported in this work. As an adjunctive strategy for the treatment of GBM, GMAN@CMN initiates anti&#8208;tumor immunity and effectively prevents GBM postoperative relapse. The implantable microneedle even holds potential when the tumor invades vital regions that cannot be surgically resected.








Abstract
Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) remains incurable despite multimodal treatments after surgical debulking. Almost all patients with GBM relapse within a narrow margin (2&#8211;3&#160;cm) of the initial resected lesion due to the unreachable residual cancerous cells. Here, a completely biodegradable microneedle for surgical cavity delivery glioblastoma&#8208;associated macrophages (GAMs)&#8208;activating immune nano&#8208;stimulator that mitigates glioblastoma relapse is reported. The residual tumor lesion&#8208;directed biocompatible microneedle releases the nano&#8208;stimulator and toll&#8208;like receptor 9 agonist in a controlled manner until the microneedles completely degrade over 1 week, efferently induce in situ phonotypic shifting of GAMs from anti&#8208; to pro&#8208;inflammatory and the tumor recurrence is obviously inhibited. The implantable microneedles offer a significant improvement over conventional transdermal ones, as they are 100% degradable, ensuring safe application within surgical cavities. It is also revealed that the T cells are recruited to the tumor niche as the GAMs initiate anti&#8208;tumor response and eradicate residual GBM cells. Taken together, this work provides a potential strategy for immunomodulating the postoperative tumor niche to mitigate tumor relapse in GBM patients, which may have broad applications in other malignancies with surgical intervention.

         <title>Achieving Near&#8208;Infrared Phosphorescence Supramolecular Hydrogel Based on Amphiphilic Bromonaphthalimide Pyridinium Hierarchical Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient near&#8208;infrared phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is constructed based on amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium hierarchical assembly in aqueous medium, which exhibits long&#8208;lived photoluminescence at 823&#160;nm with ultralarge Stokes shift and is successfully applied for cell labeling.








Abstract
Phosphorescent supramolecular hydrogels are currently a prevalent topic for their great promise in various photonic applications. Herein, an efficient near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescence supramolecular hydrogel is reported via the hierarchical assembly strategy in aqueous solution, which is fabricated from amphiphilic bromonaphthalimide pyridinium derivative (G), exfoliated Laponite (LP) nanosheets, and polymeric polyacrylamide (PAAm). Initially, G spontaneously self&#8208;aggregates into spherical nanoparticles covered with positively charged pyridinium units and emits single fluorescence at 410&#160;nm. Driven by electrostatic interactions with negatively charged nanosheets, the nanoparticles subsequently function as the cross&#8208;linked binders and coassemble with LP into supramolecular hydrogels with an engendered red room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) up to 620&#160;nm. Benefiting from hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions&#8208;mediated physical cross&#8208;linkage, the further introduction of PAAm not only significantly elevates the mechanical strength of the hydrogels showing fast self&#8208;healing capability, but also increases phosphorescence lifetime from 2.49&#160;to 4.20&#160;ms, especially generating phosphorescence at even higher temperature (&#964;
363 K = 2.46&#160;ms). Additionally, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs after doping a small amount of organic dye heptamethine cyanine (IR780) as an acceptor into hydrogels, resulting in a long&#8208;lived NIR emission at 823&#160;nm with a high donor/acceptor ratio, which is successfully applied for cell labeling in the NIR window.

         <title>In&#8208;Materia Annealing and Combinatorial Optimization Based on Vertical Memristive Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study utilizes the inter&#8208;layer interference of a vertically stacked memristive crossbar array as an annealing method for combinatorial optimization problems. When these problems are mapped into the CBA's configuration layer, decaying annealing profiles are generated in the adjacent noise layers. The annealing profiles can be controlled electrically, offering material&#8208;based noise to solve the problems efficiently. 








Abstract
Due to its area and energy efficiency, a memristive crossbar array (CBA) has been extensively studied for various combinatorial optimization applications, from network problems to circuit design. However, conventional approaches include heavily burdening software fine&#8208;tuning for the annealing process. Instead, this study introduces the &#8220;in&#8208;materia annealing&#8221; method, where the inter&#8208;layer interference of vertically stacked memristive CBA is utilized as an annealing method. When mapping combinatorial optimization problems into the configuration layer of the CBA, exponentially decaying annealing profiles are generated in nearby noise layers. Moreover, in&#8208;materia annealing profiles can be controlled by changing compliance current, read voltage, and read pulse width. Therefore, the annealing profiles can be arbitrarily controlled and generated individually for each cell, providing rich noise sources to solve the problem efficiently. Consequently, the experimental and simulation of Max&#8208;Cut and weighted Max&#8208;Cut problems achieve notable results with the minimum software burden.

         <title>Cu&#8208;In Dual Sites with Sulfur Defects toward Superior Ethanol Electrosynthesis from CO2 Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To concurrently improve the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol and catalyst stability, electro&#8208;driven intercalation is employed to form Cu&#8208;In dual&#8208;active sites with sulfur vacancies for the simultaneous adsorption of *H and *CO intermediates. This catalyst facilitates the rate&#8208;limiting step of *CHO formation for the key *OCHCHO* intermediate of ethanol production, delivering a stable and high rate of ethanol formation from CO2 electrolysis.








Abstract
The electrosynthesis of multi&#8208;carbon chemicals from excess carbon dioxide (CO2) is an area of great interest for research and commercial applications. However, improving both the yield of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;ethanol conversion and the stability of the catalyst at the same time is proving to be a challenging issue. Here it is proposed to stabilize active Cu(I) and In dual sites with sulfur defects through an electro&#8208;driven intercalation strategy, which leads to the delocalization of electron density that enhances orbital hybridizations between the Cu&#8208;C and In&#8208;H bonds. Hence, the energy barrier for the rate&#8208;limiting *CHO formation step is reduced toward the key *OCHCHO* formation during ethanol production, which is also facilitated by the combined Cu site enabling C&#8208;C coupling and In site with a higher oxygen affinity based on both thermodynamic and kinetic calculations. Accordingly, such dual&#8208;site catalyst achieves a high partial current density toward ethanol of 409 &#177; 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8315;2 for over 120 h. Furthermore, a scaled&#8208;up flow cell is assembled with an industrial&#8208;relevant current of 5.7 A for over 36 h, in which the carbon loss is less than 2.5% and single&#8208;pass carbon efficiency is &#8776;19%.

         <title>Toward Thin&#8208;Film Laser Diodes with Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This Perspective discusses fundamental material limitations and device integration challenges that need to be addressed to bring metal halide perovskite thin&#8208;film devices from lasing under optical pumping to electrical pumping. These aspects include optical gain mechanisms, carrier recombination dynamics, electroluminescence efficiency roll&#8208;off, thermal runaway, and low&#8208;optical&#8208;loss layouts with compatible resonant cavity integration methods.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite semiconductors hold a strong promise for enabling thin&#8208;film laser diodes. Perovskites distinguish themselves from other non&#8208;epitaxial media primarily through their ability to maintain performance at high current densities, which is a critical requirement for achieving injection lasing. Coming in a wide range of varieties, numerous perovskites delivered low&#8208;threshold optical amplified spontaneous emission and optically pumped lasing when combined with a suitable optical cavity. A progression toward electrically pumped lasing requires the development of efficient light&#8208;emitting structures with reduced optical losses and high radiative efficiency at lasing&#8208;level current densities. This involves a set of important trade&#8208;offs in terms of material choice, stack and waveguide design, as well as resonator integration. In this Perspective, the key milestones are highlighted that have been achieved in the study of passive optical waveguides and light&#8208;emitting diodes, and these learnings are translated toward more complex laser diode architectures. Finally, a novel resonator integration route is proposed that is capable of relaxing optical and electrical design constraints.

         <title>Atto&#8208;Scale Noise Near&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetectors Enabled by Controlling Interfacial Energetic Offset through Enhanced Anchoring Ability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study examines the JD and noise equiv. power (NEP) in NIR OPDs with varying electron blocking layers (EBLs). A newly synthesized EBL (named 3PAFBr) is introduced via a JD generation mechanism, significantly impacting NEP. The 3PAFBr&#8208;based OPD demonstrates a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1 V) and achieves several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs.








Abstract
The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) sensor technology is crucial for various applications such as autonomous driving and biometric tracking. Silicon photodetectors (SiPDs) are widely used in NIR applications; however, their scalability is limited by their crystalline properties. Organic photodetectors (OPDs) have attracted attention for NIR applications owing to their scalability, low&#8208;temperature processing, and notably low dark current density (JD), which is similar to that of SiPDs. However, the still high JD (at NIR band) and few measurements of noise equivalent powers (NEPs) pose challenges for accurate performance comparisons. This study addresses these issues by quantitatively characterizing the performance matrix and JD generation mechanism using electron&#8208;blocking layers (EBLs) in OPDs. The energy offset at an EBL/photosensitive layer interface determines the thermal activation energy and directly affects JD. A newly synthesized EBL (3PAFBr) substantially enhances the interfacial energy barrier by forming a homogeneous contact owing to the improved anchoring ability of 3PAFBr. As a result, the OPD with 3PAFBr yields a noise current of 852 aA (JD = 12.3 fA&#160;cm&#8315;2 at V &#8594; &#8722;0.1&#160;V) and several femtowatt&#8208;scale NEPs. As far as it is known, this is an ultralow of&#160;JD in NIR OPDs. This emphasizes the necessity for quantitative performance characterization.

         <title>Activated Co in Thiospinel Boosting Li2CO3 Decomposition in Li&#8722;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By Ni substitution in the tetrahedral sites of Co&#8208;based thiospinel, Co atoms are activated to construct catalytic domain with multiple active sites. Resultant adsorption configuration leads to enhanced interaction between Li2CO3 and NiCo2S4, which result in reduced energy barrier for Li2CO3 decomposition and excellent catalytic activity to CO2 evolution reaction. As a result, the charge voltage is significantly reduced.








Abstract
Catalytic reactions mainly depend on the adsorption properties of reactants on the catalyst, which provides a perspective for the design of reversible lithium&#8722;carbon dioxide (Li&#8722;CO2) batteries including CO2 reduction (CO2RR) and CO2 evolution (CO2ER) reactions. However, due to the complex reaction process, the relationship between the adsorption configuration and CO2RR/CO2ER catalytic activity is still unclear in Li&#9472;CO2 batteries. Herein, taking Co3S4 as a model system, nickel (Ni&#160;substitution in the tetrahedral site to activate cobalt (Co) atom for forming multiatom catalytic domains in NiCo2S4 is utilized. Benefiting from the special geometric and electronic structures, NiCo2S4 exhibits an optimized adsorption configuration of lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), promoting its effective activation and decomposition. As a result, the Li&#8722;CO2 batteries with NiCo2S4 cathode exhibit remarkable electrochemical performance in terms of low potential gap of 0.42&#160;V and high energy efficiency of 88.7%. This work provides a unique perspective for the development of highly efficient catalysts in Li&#8722;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Inhibited Passivation by Bioinspired Cell Membrane Zn Interface for Zn&#8211;Air Batteries with Extended Temperature Adaptability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bioinspired cell membrane Zn|electrolyte interface inhibits the growth rate of the passivation layer on the Zn surface of Zn&#8211;air batteries, thereby increasing the charge transfer dynamics at the Zn interface. The robust cycling stability of corresponding bioinspired Zn&#8211;air batteries from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is achieved, which is almost three times that of unmodified Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Due to the slow dynamics of mass and charge transfer at Zn|electrolyte interface, the stable operation of Zn&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is challenging, especially at low temperature. Herein, inspired by cell membrane, a hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulated Zn|electrolyte interface is constructed. This amphiphilic design enables the quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state (QSS) ZABs to display a long&#8208;term cyclability of 180 h@50&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 25&#160;&#176;C. Moreover, a record&#8208;long time of 173 h@4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is also achieved, which is almost threefolds of untreated QSS ZABs. Control experiments and (in situ) characterization reveal that the growth of insulating ZnO passivation layers is largely inhibited by tuned hydrophilic&#8211;hydrophobic behavior. Thus, the enhanced transfer dynamic of Zn2+ at Zn|electrolyte interface from 25 to &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C is attained. As an extension, the QSS Al&#8208;air batteries (AABs) with bioinspired interface also show unprecedented discharge stability of 420 h@1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8208;40&#160;&#176;C, which is about two times of untreated QSS AABs. This bioinspired&#8208;hydrophilic&#8208;hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.

This bioinspired-hydrophilic-hydrophobic dual modulation strategy may provide a reference for energy transform and storage devices with broad temperature adaptability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Surface Amorphization
In article number 2404103, WooChul Jung, Bong&#8208;Joong Kim, Jongsu Seo, Scott A. Barnett, and their research team successfully induced simultaneous surface amorphization and nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution on perovskite oxides through a simple hydrogen heat treatment. This surface reconstruction leads to a highly reactive and stable solid oxide fuel cell cathode, demonstrating its potential applicability to a full cell system. The cover image illustrates this surface reconstruction process, showing how hydrogen gas creates an amorphous surface and facilitates nanocatalyst ex&#8208;solution.

Hemostatic Peptide Hydrogel
The immemorial Chinese fairy tale &#8220;Nuwa fixing the sky&#8221; is used to metaphor the hemostatic process of hemostatic peptide hydrogel (HPH) in article number 2405290 by Chaoqiang Fan, Malcolm Xing, Shiming Yang, and co&#8208;workers. The hole in the sky and the pouring flood from Tianhe River are metaphors for the wound and severe hemorrhage. The goddess Nuwa is using colorful stones which represent HPH, triggered by the blue laser to halt bleeding and saving lives.

Spontaneous Separation for Air&#8208;Floating Graphene Macrofilms
By means of ethanol&#8208;based binary solution, the self&#8208;assembly performance of graphene oxide is enhanced dramatically at air&#8208;liquid interface, and the formed graphene oxide film first separates spontaneously from the solution to obtain an ultrathin air&#8208;floating graphene macrofilm (AGF). The in situ growth sensors based on AGFs are fabricated and show quick response and ultrahigh sensitivity for temperature and slight disturbance. More details can be found in article number 2408550 by Guomin Ding, Bowen Yang, Qilin Mei, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Delivery Systems Developed for Treatment Combinations to Improve Adoptive Cell Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of various delivery strategies for combination cell therapy and their application in the clinic. Furthermore, the remaining challenges and opportunities in this emerging field are disscussed in detial, with the hope of accelerating the clinical translation of adoptive cell therapy for solid tumour.








Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy (ACT) has shown great success in the clinic for treating hematologic malignancies. However, solid tumor treatment with ACT monotherapy is still challenging, owing to insufficient expansion and rapid exhaustion of adoptive cells, tumor antigen downregulation/loss, and dense tumor extracellular matrix. Delivery strategies for combination cell therapy have great potential to overcome these hurdles. The delivery of vaccines, immune checkpoint inhibitors, cytokines, chemotherapeutics, and photothermal reagents in combination with adoptive cells, have been shown to improve the expansion/activation, decrease exhaustion, and promote the penetration of adoptive cells in solid tumors. Moreover, the delivery of nucleic acids to engineer immune cells directly in vivo holds promise to overcome many of the hurdles associated with the complex ex vivo cell engineering strategies. Here, these research advance, as well as the opportunities and challenges for integrating delivery technologies into cell therapy s are discussed, and the outlook for these emerging areas are criticlly analyzed.

         <title>Enabling Sustainable Ammonia Synthesis: From Nitrogen Activation Strategies to Emerging Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 40, October 2, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers a comprehensive overview of the development of new materials and strategies aimed at enhancing N2 activation and NH3 formation in thermal catalysis. It highlights recent mechanisms, including self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, promotion of anionic vacancies, and hydridic hydrogen reduction. Furthermore, the review discusses future challenges and opportunities for achieving sustainable ammonia synthesis.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is one of the most important precursors of various chemicals and fertilizers. Given that ammonia synthesis via the traditional Haber&#8211;Bosch process requires high temperatures and pressures, it is critical to explore effective strategies and catalysts for ammonia synthesis under mild reaction conditions. Although electrocatalysis and photocatalysis can convert N2 to NH3 under mild conditions, their efficiencies and production scales are still far from the requirements for industrialization. Thermal catalysis has been proven to be the most direct and effective approach for ammonia synthesis. Over the past few decades, significant efforts have been made to develop novel catalysts capable of nitrogen fixation and ammonia generation via thermal catalytic processes. In parallel with catalyst exploration, new strategies such as self&#8208;electron donation, hydride fixation, hydridic hydrogen reduction, and anionic vacancy promotion have also been explored to moderate the operating conditions and improve the catalytic efficiency of ammonia synthesis. In this review, the emergence of new materials and strategies for promoting N2 activation and NH3 formation during thermal catalysis is briefly summarized. Moreover, challenges and prospects are proposed for the future development of thermal catalytic ammonia synthesis.

         <title>Interfacial Stress Transfer and Fracture in van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial stress transfer and fracture of a MoS2/graphene vdW heterostructure are studied, through the lateral and vertical strain distributions in the vdW heterostructure revealed in&#8208;situ. This leads to the interfacial shear strength and interfacial fracture energy being estimated, and a failure criterion proposes to predict the failure mechanisms of similar vdW heterostructures with any lateral dimensions.








Abstract
Artificially stacking 2D materials (2DMs) into vdW heterostructures creates materials with properties not present in nature that offer great potential for various applications such as flexible electronics. Properties of such stacked structures are controlled largely by the interfacial interactions and the structural integrity of the 2DMs. In spite of their crucial roles, interfacial stress transfer and the failure mechanisms of the vdW heterostructures, particularly during deformation, have not been well addressed so far. In this work, the interfacial stress transfer and failure mechanisms of a MoS2/graphene vdW heterostructure are studied, through the strain distributions both laterally in individual 2DMs and vertically across different 2DMs revealed in&#8208;situ. The fracture of the MoS2 and the associated states of stress and strain are monitored experimentally. This enables various interfacial properties, such as the interfacial shear strength and interfacial fracture energy, to be estimated. Based only on the measured strength and interfacial properties of a single vdW heterostructure, a failure criterion is proposed to predict the failure mechanisms of similar vdW heterostructures with any lateral dimensions. This work provides an insight to the deformation micromechanics of vdW heterostructures that are of great value for their miniaturization and applications, especially in flexible electronics.

         <title>Enhancing Resistance to Wetting Transition through the Concave Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the pulvilli of the leaf beetle (Gastrophysa atrocyanea), a new design strategy is introduced to enhance the wetting stability of superhydrophobic surfaces through the implementation of concave structures. The air caps forming on the concavity contribute to preventing the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition under continuous exposure to various impacts and hydrostatic pressures.








Abstract
Water&#8208;repellent superhydrophobic surfaces are ubiquitous in nature. The fundamental understanding of bio/bio&#8208;inspired structures facilitates practical applications surmounting metastable superhydrophobicity. Typically, the hierarchical structure and/or reentrant morphology have been employed hitherto to suppress the Cassie&#8208;Baxter to Wenzel transition (CWT). Herein, a new design concept is reported, an effect of concave structure, which is vital for the stable superhydrophobic surface. The thermodynamic and kinetic stabilities of the concave pillars are evaluated by continuous exposure to various hydrostatic pressures and sudden impacts of water droplets with various Weber numbers (We), comparing them to the standard superhydrophobic normal pillars. Specifically, the concave pillar exhibits reinforced impact resistance preventing CWT below a critical We of &#8776;27.6, which is &#8776;1.6 times higher than that of the normal pillar (&#8776;17.0). Subsequently, the stability of underwater air film (plastron) is investigated at various hydrostatic pressures. The results show that convex air caps formed at the concave cavities generate downward Laplace pressure opposing the exerted hydrostatic pressure between the pillars, thus impeding the hydrostatic pressure&#8208;dependent underwater air diffusion. Hence, the effects of trapped air caps contributing to the stable Cassie&#8208;Baxter state can offer a pioneering strategy for the exploration and utilization of superhydrophobic surfaces.

         <title>Dismountable Protein Corona&#8208;Modified Virus&#8208;Like Manganese&#8208;Arsenic Nanomedicine Enables Safe and Targeted Delivery for Synergistic Arsenotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dismountable protein corona&#8208;modified virus&#8208;like manganese&#8208;arsenic nanomedicine is developed for realizing synergistic arsenotherapy. This nanomedicine can not only realize efficient endocytosis by taking advantage of the virus&#8208;like structure but also safe and synergistic arsenotherapy in multiple mice tumor models by utilizing the dismountable protein corona as a protecting shell as well as a flexible chassis for loading drugs.








Abstract
Arsenic agents have shown great potential in fighting leukemia, but are poorly known in treating solid tumors, mainly ascribing to the rapid clearance and low targeting ability. It is reported that morphology modulation can enhance the interaction between nanoparticles and cell membrane. Herein, a dismountable protein corona&#8208;modified virus&#8208;like manganese&#8208;arsenic nanomedicine (vMnAs@HR) is rationally proposed for realizing safe and targeted delivery and synergistic arsenotherapy. The virus&#8208;like manganese&#8208;arsenic nanoparticle (vMnAs) is constructed followed by modification of a temporary R848&#8208;loaded HDL (HR) protein corona. Upon intravenous injection, the HR protein corona is stable and actively targeted to tumor tissue by taking advantage of the interaction between HDL and its receptor SR&#8208;BI. Intriguingly, upon accumulated in the tumor, HR can be jettisoned and interacted with macrophages for proinflammatory phenotype modulation. The re&#8208;exposed vMnAs can efficiently enhance endocytosis by taking advantage of the rationally designed spiky morphology. Moreover, the released double&#8208;stranded DNA (dsDNA) and manganese ions during tumor cell apoptosis can cooperatively activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate adenosine monophosphate synthase (cGAS)&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (STING) signaling pathway of DCs for systematic immune activation. It is anticipated that this morphology&#8208;transformable nanomedicine can realize safe and efficient arsenic delivery for synergistic arsenotherapy.

         <title>Engineered Shape&#8208;Morphing Transitions in Hydrogels Through Suspension Bath Printing of Temperature&#8208;Responsive Granular Hydrogel Inks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple multi&#8208;material 4D printing technique that combines a dynamic temperature&#8208;responsive granular hydrogel with granular suspension bath printing is developed. The printed objects show programmable shape morphing based on printed patterns/bath shapes and exhibit rapid response due to their granular nature. This approach offers a versatile method to fabricate programmable soft actuators with rapid kinetics and precise control over shape morphing.








Abstract
4D printing of hydrogels is an emerging technology used to fabricate shape&#8208;morphing soft materials that are responsive to external stimuli for use in soft robotics and biomedical applications. Soft materials are technically challenging to process with current 4D printing methods, which limits the design and actuation potential of printed structures. Here, a simple multi&#8208;material 4D printing technique is developed that combines dynamic temperature&#8208;responsive granular hydrogel inks based on hyaluronic acid, whose actuation is modulated via poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) crosslinker design, with granular suspension bath printing that provides structural support during and after the printing process. Granular hydrogels are easily extruded upon jamming due to their shear&#8208;thinning properties and their porous structure enables rapid actuation kinetics (i.e., seconds). Granular suspension baths support responsive ink deposition into complex patterns due to shear&#8208;yielding to fabricate multi&#8208;material objects that can be post&#8208;crosslinked to obtain anisotropic shape transformations. Dynamic actuation is explored by varying printing patterns and bath shapes, achieving complex shape transformations such as &#8216;S&#8217;&#8208;shaped and hemisphere structures. Furthermore, stepwise actuation is programmed into multi&#8208;material structures by using microgels with varied transition temperatures. Overall, this approach offers a simple method to fabricate programmable soft actuators with rapid kinetics and precise control over shape morphing.

         <title>Lysosome Targeted Nanoparticle Aggregation Reverses Immunosuppressive Tumor Microenvironment for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the lysosomal swelling caused by excessive accumulation of undegraded substances, a lysosomal&#8208;targeting aggregated nanoparticle (LTANP) is synthesized for cancer treatment. By rationally engineering surface properties and interparticle interactions, LTANP enables targeted aggregation in lysosomes of cancer cells, leading to unrelievable lysosomal swelling, and ultimately selectively inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization and immunogenic cell death of cancer cells.








Abstract
Nanotechnology has proven its enormous application value in clinical practice. However, current research on nanomedicines mainly focuses on developing nanoparticles as delivery carriers to maximize the bioavailability of therapeutic agents, with little attention on exploring their potential to directly regulate physiological processes. In this study, inspired by the lysosomal swelling caused by excessive accumulation of undegraded substances, this work presents a lysosomal&#8208;targeting aggregated nanoparticle (LTANP) for cancer treatment. By rationally engineering surface composition, properties, and interparticle interactions, LTANP achieves efficient tumor accumulation and selective targeted aggregation in lysosomes of cancer cells, leading to unrelievable lysosomal swelling, and ultimately inducing lysosomal membrane permeabilization (LMP) of cancer cells. Further analysis shows that nanoparticle aggregation&#8208;mediated LMP can effectively trigger immunogenic cell death (ICD) by impairing autophagy&#8208;lysosome pathway, evoking robust antitumor immune responses and reversing tumor immunogenicity from &#8220;cold&#8221; to &#8220;hot&#8221; in a melanoma model. Additionally, LTANP can combine with clinically approved programmed death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibodies to further unleash T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity, significantly enhancing antitumor performance, inhibiting tumor recurrence and metastasis. This work demonstrates the potential of rationally engineered nanostructures in directly combating cancer and provides novel insights for the development of advanced nanoparticle&#8208;based cancer treatment.

         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Enhanced Nanocatalysts Trigger Neutrophil N1 Polarization against Bacterial Biofilm by Disrupting Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti&#8208;infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS&#8208;defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine &#947;&#8208;cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilm infections.

         <title>Thresholding Computing with Heterogeneous Integration of Memristive Kernel with Metal&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Semiconductor Capacitor for Temporal Data Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an integrated thresholding kernel with two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS) metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) for precise thresholding in time&#8208;series data. This kernel system demonstrates an improved detection scheme in ECG analysis and achieved high accuracy in spoken digit classification, utilizing the capacitive thresholding to enhance memristive event detection ability for bio&#8208;indicator applications.








Abstract
Precise event detection within time&#8208;series data is increasingly critical, particularly in noisy environments. Reservoir computing, a robust computing method widely utilized with memristive devices, is efficient in processing temporal signals. However, it typically lacks intrinsic thresholding mechanisms essential for precise event detection. This study introduces a new approach by integrating two Pt/HfO2/TiN (PHT) memristors and one Ni/HfO2/n&#8208;Si (NHS)&#160;metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor capacitor (2M1MOS) to implement a tunable thresholding function. The current&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of memristors combined with the capacitance&#8208;voltage nonlinearity of the capacitor forms the basis of the 2M1MOS kernel system. The proposed kernel hardware effectively records feature&#8208;specified information of the input signal onto the memristors through capacitive thresholding. In electrocardiogram analysis, the memristive response exhibited a more than ten&#8208;fold difference between arrhythmia and normal beats. In isolated spoken digit classification, the kernel achieved an error rate of only 0.7% by tuning thresholds for various time&#8208;specific conditions. The kernel is also applied to biometric authentication by extracting personal features using various threshold times, presenting more complex and multifaceted uses of heartbeats and voice data as bio&#8208;indicators. These demonstrations highlight the potential of thresholding computing in a memristive framework with heterogeneous integration.

         <title>Suppressing Hole Accumulation Through Sub&#8208;Nanometer Dipole Interfaces in Hybrid Perovskite/Organic Solar Cells for Boosting Near&#8208;Infrared Photon Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs), the interface between the perovskite and organic bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) is carefully engineered with dipole interfacial layers (DILs). These DILs form strong interfacial dipoles, effectively reducing energy barriers and suppressing hole accumulation. Additionally, DILs enhance near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting and charge transport, boosting efficiency to 24.0% and achieving stability of 1200&#160;h under extreme moisture conditions.








Abstract
The potential of hybrid perovskite/organic solar cells (HSCs) is increasingly recognized owing to their advantageous characteristics, including straightforward fabrication, broad&#8208;spectrum photon absorption, and minimal open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) loss. Nonetheless, a key bottleneck for efficiency improvement is the energy level mismatch at the perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) interface, leading to charge accumulation. In this study, it is demonstrated that introducing a uniform sub&#8208;nanometer dipole layer formed of B3PyMPM onto the perovskite surface effectively reduces the 0.24&#160;eV energy band offset between the perovskite and the donor of BHJ. This strategic modification suppresses the charge recombination loss, resulting in a noticeable 30&#160;mV increase in the VOC and a balanced carrier transport, accompanied by a 5.0% increase in the fill factor. Consequently, HSCs that achieve power conversion efficiency of 24.0% is developed, a new record for Pb&#8208;based HSCs with a remarkable increase in the short&#8208;circuit current of 4.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, attributed to enhanced near&#8208;infrared photon harvesting.

         <title>Amorphous&#8208;Crystalline Interface Induced Internal Electric Fields for Electrochromic Smart Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TiO2 nanosheets with abundant amorphous/crystalline heterointerfaces (A/C&#8208;TiO2) are constructed. The alignment of Fermi levels of amorphous and crystalline TiO2 domains can introduce an internal electric field and therefore reduce the diffusion energy barrier of Li+. Consequently, it shortens the response time and improves the coloration efficiency.








Abstract
Balancing optical modulation and response time is crucial for achieving high coloration efficiency in electrochromic materials. Here, internal electric fields are introduced to titanium dioxide nanosheets by constructing abundant amorphous&#8208;crystalline interfaces, ensuring large optical modulation while reducing response time and therefore improving coloration efficiency. Aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) reveals the presence of numerous amorphous&#8208;crystalline phase boundaries in titanium dioxide nanosheets. Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) exhibits an intense surface potential distribution, demonstrating the presence of internal electric fields. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that the amorphous&#8208;crystalline heterointerfaces can generate internal electric fields and reduce diffusion barriers of lithium ions. As a result, the amorphous&#8208;crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets exhibit better coloration efficiency (35.1&#160;cm2&#160;C&#8722;1) than pure amorphous and crystalline titanium dioxide nanosheets.

         <title>Topologically Close&#8208;Packed Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 Phase Intermetallic Ir Alloy Electrocatalysts Enables High&#8208;Performance Proton Exchange Membrane Water Electrolyzer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of unconventional Frank&#8208;Kasper intermetallic C15&#8208;Ir2M (M = rare earth metals) nanocrystals is prepared as hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts, which features higher Ir&#8208;M coordination numbers and electron&#8208;rich environment. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce/C||IrO2 system in a practical PEMWE requires only a cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V to achieve the industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 and can keep stable for 1000&#160;h at 80&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Chemical synthesis of unconventional topologically close&#8208;packed intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of large volume asymmetry between the components. Here, a series of unconventional intermetallic Frank&#8208;Kasper C15 phase Ir2M (M = rare earth metals La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Tm) NCs is successfully prepared via a molten&#8208;salt assisted reduction method as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to the disordered counterpart (A1&#8208;Ir2Ce), C15&#8208;Ir2Ce features higher Ir&#8208;Ce coordination number that leads to an electron&#8208;rich environment for Ir sites. The C15&#8208;Ir2Ce catalyst exhibits excellent and pH&#8208;universal HER activity and requires only 9, 16, and 27&#160;mV overpotentials to attain 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, representing one of the best HER electrocatalysts ever reported. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the C15&#8208;Ir2Ce cathode achieves an industrial&#8208;scale current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 with a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V at 80&#160;&#176;C and can operate stably for 1000 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 50 &#181;V h&#8722;1. Theoretical investigations reveal that the electron&#8208;rich Ir sites intensify the polarization of *H2O intermediate on C15&#8208;Ir2Ce, thus lowering the energy barrier of the water dissociation and facilitating the HER kinetics.

&lt;p&gt;A series of unconventional Frank-Kasper intermetallic C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M (M = rare earth metals) nanocrystals is prepared as hydrogen evolution electrocatalysts, which features higher Ir-M coordination numbers and electron-rich environment. The C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce/C||IrO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system in a practical PEMWE requires only a cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V to achieve the industrial-scale current density of 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and can keep stable for 1000&#160;h at 80&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Chemical synthesis of unconventional topologically close-packed intermetallic nanocrystals (NCs) remains a considerable challenge due to the limitation of large volume asymmetry between the components. Here, a series of unconventional intermetallic Frank-Kasper C15 phase Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;M (M = rare earth metals La, Ce, Gd, Tb, Tm) NCs is successfully prepared via a molten-salt assisted reduction method as efficient electrocatalysts for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Compared to the disordered counterpart (A1-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce), C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce features higher Ir-Ce coordination number that leads to an electron-rich environment for Ir sites. The C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce catalyst exhibits excellent and pH-universal HER activity and requires only 9, 16, and 27&#160;mV overpotentials to attain 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in acidic, alkaline, and neutral electrolytes, respectively, representing one of the best HER electrocatalysts ever reported. In a proton exchange membrane water electrolyzer, the C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce cathode achieves an industrial-scale current density of 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; with a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.7&#160;V at 80&#160;&#176;C and can operate stably for 1000 h with a sluggish voltage decay rate of 50 &#181;V h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Theoretical investigations reveal that the electron-rich Ir sites intensify the polarization of *H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O intermediate on C15-Ir&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ce, thus lowering the energy barrier of the water dissociation and facilitating the HER kinetics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust Electric&#8208;Field Control of Colossal Exchange Bias in CrI3 Homotrilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust electric&#8208;field control of exchange bias (EB)&#160;effect and magnetism transition is realized in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer. The doping from the Y&#8208;doped HfO2 substrate alters the interlayer coupling of intrinsic CrI3 trilayer and further causes the EB effect. The gate voltage reverses the magnetization direction layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer in homotrilayer CrI3, leading to a colossal EB modulation of 0.48 T.








Abstract
Controlling exchange bias (EB) by electric fields is crucial for next&#8208;generation magnetic random access memories and spintronics with ultralow energy consumption and ultrahigh speed. Multiferroic heterostructures have been traditionally used to electrically control EB and interfacial ferromagnetism through weak/indirect coupling between ferromagnetic and ferroelectric films. However, three major bottlenecks (lattice mismatch, interface defects, and weak/indirect coupling in multiferroic heterostructures) remain, resulting in only a few tens of milli&#8208;tesla EB field. Here, this study reports a robust electric&#8208;field control recipe to dynamically tailor the EB effect in a pure CrI3 homotrilayer on a ferroelectric Y&#8208;doped HfO2 (HYO) substrate, and demonstrate a colossal and tunable EB field (HE) from &#8722;0.15 to +0.33 T, giving rise to an EB modulation of 0.48 T. The charge doping due to ferroelectric HYO film divides a homo&#8208;configuration of CrI3 homotrilayer into one antiferromagnetic (AFM) bilayer CrI3 and one ferromagnetic (FM) monolayer CrI3, favoring direct exchange coupling. The synergies of charge doping and electric field induce a transition of magnetic orders from AFM to FM phase in bilayer CrI3, which is also supported by first&#8208;principles calculations, leading to the robust electric control of colossal EB effect. The results therefore open numerous opportunities for exploring 2D spintronics, memories, and braininspired in&#8208;memory computing.

         <title>Interface/Dipole Polarized Antibiotics&#8208;Loaded Fe3O4/PB Nanoparticles for Non&#8208;Invasive Therapy of Osteomyelitis Under Medical Microwave Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetically targeted composite PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent combined with MTT/MDT/CT is developed for the eradication of acute osteomyelitis infected by S aureus. PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent improved dielectric loss and optimized impedance matching, which improved MW absorption capacity. Due to interfacial polarization and dipole polarization effects, PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent could generate ROS, thus it has MW catalytic performance.








Abstract
Due to their poor light penetration, photothermal therapy and photodynamic therapy are ineffective in treating deep tissue infections, such as osteomyelitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus). Here, a microwave (MW)&#8208;responsive magnetic targeting composite system consisting of ferric oxide (Fe3O4)/Prussian blue (PB) nanoparticles, gentamicin (Gent), and biodegradable poly(lactic&#8208;co&#8208;glycolic acid) (PLGA) is reported. The PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent complex is used in combination with MW thermal therapy (MTT), MW dynamic therapy (MDT), and chemotherapy (CT) to treat acute osteomyelitis infected with S. aureus&#8208;infected. The powerful antibacterial effect of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent is determined by the synergistic effects of heat and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by the Fe3O4/PB nanoparticles under MW irradiation and the effective release of Gent at the infection site via magnetic targeting. The antibacterial mechanism of the PLGA/Fe3O4/PB/Gent under MW irradiation is analyzed using bacterial transcriptome RNA sequencing. The MW heat and ROS reduce the activity of the protein transporters on the bacterial membrane, along with the transport of various ions and the acceleration of phosphate metabolism, which can lead to increased permeability of the bacterial membrane, damage the ribosome and DNA, and accompany the internal protein efflux of the bacteria, thus effectively killing the bacteria.

Abstract
Bacterial&#8208;induced lower respiratory tract infections are a growing global health concern, exacerbated by the inefficacy of conventional antibiotics and delivery methods to effectively target the lower respiratory tract, leading to suboptimal therapeutic outcomes. To address this challenge, this work engineers PBP2a antibody&#8208;presenting membrane nanovesicles (AMVs) specifically designed to target the penicillin&#8208;binding protein variant on the surface of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Concurrently, this work develops pure ciprofloxacin nanoparticles (NanoCip) that, for the first time, exhibits exceptional self&#8208;generated sonodynamic properties, attributed to hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly, while maintaining their inherent pharmacological efficacy. These NanoCip particles are integrated with AMVs to create a novel biomimetic nanomedicine, AMV@NanoCip. This formulation demonstrated remarkable MRSA&#8208;targeting affinity in both in vitro and in vivo models, significantly enhancing antibacterial activity. Upon ultrasound stimulation, AMV@NanoCip achieves over 99.99% sterilization of MRSA in vitro, with a reduction exceeding 5.14 Log CFU. Prokaryotic transcriptomic analysis further elucidates the synergistic mechanisms by which AMV@NanoCip, coupled with ultrasound, disrupts the MRSA exoskeleton. In a MRSA&#8208;induced pneumonia animal model, AMV@NanoCip+US results in a substantial bacterial load reduction in the lungs (99.99%, 4.02 Log CFU). This sequential treatment strategy (adhesion&#8208;membrane disruption&#8208;synergistic therapy) offers significant promise as an innovative therapeutic approach for combating bacterial infections.

         <title>Fiber Optic&#8208;Mediated Type I Photodynamic Therapy of Brain Glioblastoma Based on an Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated strategy that harnesses a less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer and a modified optical fiber is developed for the first time to implement exceptional photodynamic therapy in the hypoxic glioblastoma after circumventing the light blockage from skin, skull, and tissues.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. The current standard&#8208;of&#8208;care is highly invasive with strong toxic side effects, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality. As a safe and effective clinical approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a suitable option for GBM. Nevertheless, its implementation is significantly impeded by the limits of light penetration depth and the firm reliance on oxygen. To overcome these challenges, herein, a promising strategy that harnesses a modified optical fiber and less oxygen&#8208;dependent Type I aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) is developed for the first time to realize in vivo GBM treatments. The proposed AIE PS, namely TTTMN, characterized by a highly twisted molecular architecture and a bulky spacer, exhibits enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission and strong production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals at the aggregated state, thus affording efficient fluorescence imaging&#8208;guided PDT once formulated into nanoparticles. The inhibition of orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenografts provides compelling evidence of the treatment efficacy of Type I PDT irradiated through a tumor&#8208;inserted optical fiber. These findings highlight the substantially improved therapeutic outcomes achieved through fiber optic&#8208;mediated Type I PDT, positioning it as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM.

&lt;p&gt;Glioblastoma (GBM) is one of the most lethal human malignancies. The current standard-of-care is highly invasive with strong toxic side effects, leading to poor prognosis and high mortality. As a safe and effective clinical approach, photodynamic therapy (PDT) has emerged as a suitable option for GBM. Nevertheless, its implementation is significantly impeded by the limits of light penetration depth and the firm reliance on oxygen. To overcome these challenges, herein, a promising strategy that harnesses a modified optical fiber and less oxygen-dependent Type I aggregation-induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (PS) is developed for the first time to realize in vivo GBM treatments. The proposed AIE PS, namely TTTMN, characterized by a highly twisted molecular architecture and a bulky spacer, exhibits enhanced near-infrared emission and strong production of hydroxyl and superoxide radicals at the aggregated state, thus affording efficient fluorescence imaging-guided PDT once formulated into nanoparticles. The inhibition of orthotopic and subcutaneous GBM xenografts provides compelling evidence of the treatment efficacy of Type I PDT irradiated through a tumor-inserted optical fiber. These findings highlight the substantially improved therapeutic outcomes achieved through fiber optic-mediated Type I PDT, positioning it as a promising therapeutic modality for GBM.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Polymer&#8208;Based Photo&#8208;Crosslinker for Efficient Photo&#8208;Patterning of Polymer Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new conjugated polymer&#8208;based photo&#8208;crosslinker, PN3, with phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in the side chains, is developed for efficient photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with superior performance, featuring a significantly low UV light exposure dose, high sensitivity (S), and high contrast (&#947;).








Abstract
Photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors using photo&#8208;crosslinkers has shown potential for organic circuit fabrication via solution processing techniques. However, the performance of patterning, including resolution (R), UV light exposure dose, sensitivity (S), and contrast (&#947;), remains unsatisfactory. In this study, a novel conjugated polymer based photo&#8208;crosslinker (PN3, Figure 1a) is reported for the first time, which entails phenyl&#8208;substituted azide groups in its side chains. Due to the potential &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions between the conjugated backbone of PN3 and those of polymer semiconductors, PN3 exhibits superior miscibility with polymer semiconductors compared to the commonly used small molecule photo&#8208;crosslinker 4Bx (Figure 1a). Consequently, photo&#8208;patterning of polymer semiconductors with PN3 demonstrates improved performance with much lower UV light exposure dose, higher S and higher &#947; compared to 4Bx. By utilizing electron beam lithography, patterned arrays of polymer semiconductors with resolutions down to 500&#160;nm and clearer edges are successfully fabricated using PN3. Furthermore, patterned arrays of PDPP4T, the p&#8208;type semiconductor (Figure 1b), after being doped, can function as source&#8208;drain electrodes for fabricating field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with comparable charge mobility and significantly lower sub&#8208;threshold swing value compared to those with gold electrodes.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Aqueous Supercapacitors Based on a Self&#8208;Doped n&#8208;Type Conducting Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The n&#8208;type conjugated polymer PBDF offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions. It is possible to combine PBDF with the conjugated polyelectrolyte CPE&#8208;K to fabricate asymmetric cells with excellent cycling stability.








Abstract
Environmentally&#8208;benign materials play a pivotal role in advancing the scalability of energy storage devices. In particular, conjugated polymers constitute a potentially greener alternative to inorganic&#8208; and carbon&#8208;based materials. One challenge to wider implementation is the scarcity of n&#8208;doped conducting polymers to achieve full cells with high&#8208;rate performance. Herein, this work demonstrates the use of a self&#8208;doped n&#8208;doped conjugated polymer, namely poly(benzodifurandione) (PBDF), for fabricating aqueous supercapacitors. PBDF demonstrates a specific capacitance of 202 &#177; 3 F&#160;g&#8722;1, retaining 81% of the initial performance over 5000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1 in 2&#160;m NaCl(aq). PBDF demonstrates rate performances of up to 100 and 50 A&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1 and 2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively. Electrochemical impedance analysis reveals a surface&#8208;mediated charge storage mechanism. Improvements can be achieved by adding reduced graphene oxide (rGO), thereby obtaining a specific capacitance of 288 &#177; 8 F&#160;g&#8722;1 and high&#8208;rate operation (270 A&#160;g&#8722;1). The performance of PBDF is examined in symmetric and asymmetric membrane&#8208;less cells, demonstrating high&#8208;rate performance, while retaining 83% of the initial capacitance after 100&#160;000 cycles at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1. PBDF thus offers new prospects for energy storage applications, showcasing both desirable performance and stability without the need for additives or binders and relying on environmentally friendly solutions.

         <title>Electrolyte Solvation Engineering Stabilizing Anode&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Battery With 4.0&#160;V&#8208;Class Layered Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A WSAS electrolyte is designed by creating robust solvation clusters during the dynamic solvation process at the electrode/electrolyte interface, which relies on the balanced interplay between ion&#8208;ion and ion&#8208;solvent interactions. This design facilitates the formation of a stable, inorganic&#8208;rich CEI and SEI, enabling commercial anode&#8208;free pouch cells to retain 80% of their capacity after 50 cycles.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free sodium metal batteries (AFSMBs) are regarded as the &#8220;ceiling&#8221; for current sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, their practical application is hindered by the unstable electrolyte and interfacial chemistry at the high&#8208;voltage cathode and anode&#8208;free side, especially under extreme temperature conditions. Here, an advanced electrolyte design strategy based on electrolyte solvation engineering is presented, which shapes a weakly solvating anion&#8208;stabilized (WSAS) electrolyte by balancing the interaction between the Na+&#8208;solvent and Na+&#8208;anion. The special interaction constructs rich contact ion pairs (CIPs) /aggregates (AGGs) clusters at the electrode/electrolyte interface during the dynamic solvation process which facilitates the formation of a uniform and stable interfacial layer, enabling highly stable cycling of 4.0&#160;V&#8208;class layered oxide cathode from &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C to 60&#160;&#176;C and excellent reversibility of Na plating/stripping with an ultrahigh average CE of 99.89%. Ultimately, industrial multi&#8208;layer anode&#8208;free pouch cells using the WSAS electrolyte achieve 80% capacity remaining after 50 cycles and even deliver 74.3% capacity at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. This work takes a pivotal step for the further development of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Na batteries.

         <title>Molecular Engineering of Poly(Ionic Liquid) for Direct and Continuous Production of Pure Formic Acid from Flue Gas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to pure formic acid from flue gas via electrochemical CO2RR process. PIL coating improves CO2 adsorption and lowers the activation barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation. The integrated process shows significantly reduced cost compared to a decoupled process.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the carbon cycle and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. However, traditional decoupled CO2RR processes involve energy&#8208;intensive CO2 capture, conversion, and product separation, which increases operational costs. Here, we report the development of a bismuth&#8208;poly(ionic liquid) (Bi&#8208;PIL) hybrid catalyst that exhibits exceptional electrocatalytic performance for CO2 conversion to formate. The Bi&#8208;PIL catalyst achieves over 90% Faradaic efficiency for formate over a wide potential range, even at low 15% v/v CO2 concentrations typical of industrial flue gas. The biphenyl in PIL backbone affords hydrophobicity while maintaining high ionic conductivity, effectively mitigating the flooding issues. The PIL layer plays a crucial role as a CO2 concentrator and co&#8208;catalyst that accelerates the CO2RR kinetics. Furthermore, we demonstrate the potential of Bi&#8208;PIL catalysts in a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) electrolyzer for the continuous and direct production of pure formic acid solutions from flue gas. Techno&#8208;economic analysis suggests that this integrated process can produce formic acid at a significantly reduced cost compared to the traditional decoupled approaches. This work presents a promising strategy to overcome the challenges associated with low&#8208;concentration CO2 utilization and streamline the production of valuable liquid fuels and chemicals from CO2.

Techno-economic analysis suggests that this integrated process can produce formic acid at a significantly reduced cost compared to the traditional decoupled approaches. This work presents a promising strategy to overcome the challenges associated with low-concentration CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; utilization and streamline the production of valuable liquid fuels and chemicals from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Ultrastable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Battery Using a Covalent Organic Framework Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (HATP&#8208;PT COF) material is synthesized as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. Due to the stable framework and hydrogen&#8208;bond coordinated mechanism, such HATP&#8208;PT COF can deliver an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for aqueous ammonium ion batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium ion batteries have garnered significant research interest due to their safety and sustainability advantages. However, the development of reliable ammonium&#8208;based full batteries with consistent electrochemical performance, particularly in terms of cycling stability, remains challenging. A primary issue stems from the lack of suitable anode materials, as the relatively large NH4+ ions can cause structural damage and material dissolution during battery operation. To address this challenge, an Aza&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF) material is introduced as an anode for aqueous ammonium ion batteries. This material exhibits superior ammonium storage capabilities compared to existing anode materials. It operates effectively within a negative potential range of 0.3 to&#8210;1.0 V versus SCE, achieves high capacity even at elevated current densities (&#8776;74 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1), and demonstrates exceptional stability, retaining a capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1. Furthermore, by pairing this COF anode with a Prussian blue cathode, an ammonium rocking&#8208;chair full battery is developedd that maintains 89% capacity over 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.0 A g&#8722;1, surpassing all previously reported ammonium ion full batteries. This study offers insights for the design of future anodes for ammonium ion batteries and holds promise for high&#8208;energy storage solutions.

         <title>Aggregation&#8208;Disruption&#8208;Induced Multi&#8208;Scale Mediating Strategy for Anticoagulation in Blood&#8208;Contacting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;scale mediation coating strategy is proposed to simultaneously inhibit nanoscale coagulation factors and resist aggregation of microscale thrombi. Surface force measurements reveal that the coating disrupts the thrombi skeleton, and in vivo intubation experiments in rabbits show significantly reduced thromboinflammation, promising for the long&#8208;term anticoagulation of blood&#8208;contacting devices.








Abstract
Minimally invasive blood&#8208;contacting interventional devices are increasingly used to treat cardiovascular diseases. However, the risk of device&#8208;related thrombosis remains a significant concern, particularly the formation of cycling thrombi, which pose life&#8208;threatening risks. To better understand the interactions between these devices and blood, the initial stages of coagulation contact activation on extrinsic surfaces are&#160;investigated. Direct force measurements reveals that activated contact factors stimulate the intrinsic coagulation pathway and promote surface crosslinking of fibrin. Furthermore, fibrin aggregation is disrupted by surface&#8208;grafted inhibitors, as confirmed by ex vivo coagulation tests. An engineered serum protein with zwitterion grafts to resist the deposition of biological species such as fibrin, platelets, and red blood cells is also developed. Simultaneously, a protease inhibitor&#8208;based coacervate is incorporated into the coating to inhibit the intrinsic pathway effectively. The loaded coacervate can be released and reloaded through modulation of catechol&#8208;amine interactions, facilitating material regeneration. The strategy offers a novel multi&#8208;scale mediation strategy that simultaneously inhibits nanoscale coagulation factors and resists microscale thrombus aggregation, providing a long&#8208;term solution for anticoagulation in blood&#8208;contacting devices.

         <title>An Intelligent Intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Rapid Screening of Probiotics with Relief&#8208;Enteritis Function</title>

         <dc:description>
The TOC figure shows an advanced intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip system integrated with machine learning for efficient, high&#8208;throughput probiotic screening to treat enteritis. This system supports intestinal cell&#8211;probiotic coculture and generates multimodal datasets. Machine learning then analyzes these datasets to detect subtle therapeutic differences among probiotic strains, ranking their effectiveness for cost&#8208;effective, accurate screening.








Abstract
Screening probiotics with specific functions is essential for advancing probiotic research. Current screening methods primarily use animal studies or clinical trials, which are inefficient and costly in terms of time, money, and labor. An intelligent intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip integrating machine learning (ML) is developed to screen relief&#8208;enteritis functional probiotics. A high&#8208;throughput microfluidic chip combined with environment control systems provides a standardized and scalable intestinal microenvironment for multiple probiotic cocultures. An unsupervised ML&#8208;based score analyzer is constructed to accurately, comprehensively, and efficiently evaluate interactions between 12 Bifidobacterium strains and host cells of the colitis model in the intestine&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chips. The most effective contender, Bifidobacterium longum 3&#8211;14, is discovered to relieve intestinal inflammation and enhance epithelial barrier function in vitro and in vivo. A distinct advantage of this strategy is that it can intelligently differentiate small therapeutic variations in probiotic strains and prioritize their efficacies, allowing for economical, efficient, accurate functional probiotics screening.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, the ability of thermal protection either depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, we propose an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4, and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50%&#8722;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. Our scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8208;3.1 MW&#183;m&#8722;2, and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Furthermore, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, our scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for the development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

         <title>A Topological Parametric Phonon Oscillator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological bosonic systems have recently aroused intense interests in exploring exotic phenomena that have no counterparts in electronic systems. The squeezed bosonic interaction in these systems is particularly interesting, because it can modify the vacuum fluctuations of topological states, drive them into instabilities, and lead to topological parametric oscillators. However, these phenomena remain experimentally elusive because of limited nonlinearities in most existing topological bosonic systems. Here, a topological parametric phonon oscillator is experimentally realized based on a nonlinear nanoelectromechanical Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity with strong squeezed interaction. Specifically, the Dirac&#8208;vortex cavity is parametrically driven to provide phase&#8208;sensitive amplification for topological phonons, leading to the observation of coherent parametric phonon oscillation above the threshold. Additionally, it is confirmed that the random frequency variation caused by fabrication disorders can be suppressed effectively by increasing the cavity size, while the free spectral range reduces at a much slower rate, which benefit the realization of large&#8208;area single&#8208;mode lasers. Our results represent an important advance in experimental investigations of topological physics with large bosonic nonlinearities and parametric gain.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Mediated DNA Nanotechnology in 3D: Structural Library by Templated Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA double helices containing metal&#8208;mediated DNA (mmDNA) base pairs have been constructed from Ag+ and Hg2+ ions between pyrimidine:pyrimidine pairs with the promise of nanoelectronics. Rational design of mmDNA nanomaterials has been impractical without a complete lexical and structural description. Here, we explore the programmability of structural DNA nanotechnology toward its founding mission of self&#8208;assembling a diffraction platform for biomolecular structure determination. We employed the tensegrity triangle to build a comprehensive structural library of mmDNA pairs via X&#8208;ray diffraction and elucidated generalized design rules for mmDNA construction. We uncovered two binding modes: N3&#8208;dominant, centrosymmetric pairs and major groove binders driven by 5&#8208;position ring modifications. Energy gap calculations showed additional levels in the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals (LUMO) of mmDNA structures, rendering them attractive molecular electronic candidates.
