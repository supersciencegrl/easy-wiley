         <title>Achieving Tunable Organic Afterglow and UV&#8208;Irradiation&#8208;Responsive Ultralong Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Pyridine&#8208;Substituted Triphenylamine Derivatives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of polymer&#8208;based room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with ultralong lifetime, tunable afterglow, and UV&#8208;irradiation response is developed by simply doping pyridine&#8208;substituted TPA derivatives into the poly(vinyl alcohol) PVA and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) polymer matrixes, respectively. Diversified encryption patterns are fabricated to demonstrate the potential applications of these doping PVA and PMMA systems in multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting and information encryption technologies.








Abstract
Amorphous polymers with ultralong room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) are highly promising for various applications. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with multiple functions such as color&#8208;tunability or stimulus&#8208;response are highly desirable for multilevel anti&#8208;counterfeiting but are rarely reported. Herein, a facile strategy is presented to achieve a series of polymer&#8208;based RTP materials with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and reversible response to UV irradiation by simply embedding pyridine&#8208;substituted triphenylamine derivatives into the polymer matrix poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), respectively. Notably, the pyridine group with the capabilities of promoting intersystem crossing and forming hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions is essential for triggering ultralong RTP from the doping PVA system, among which the doping film TPA&#8208;2Py@PVA exhibits excellent RTP property with an ultralong lifetime of 798.4&#160;ms and a high quantum yield of 15.2%. By further co&#8208;doping with the commercially available fluorescent dye, multicolor afterglow is obtained via phosphorescence energy transfer. Meanwhile, the doped PMMA system exhibits reversible photoactivated ultralong RTP properties under continuous UV irradiation. Finally, potential applications of these doped PVA and PMMA systems with ultralong lifetime, multicolor afterglow, and photoactivated ultralong RTP in multidimensional anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated.

         <title>Carbon Additive Manufacturing with a Near&#8208;Replica &#8220;Green&#8208;to&#8208;Brown&#8221; Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite architected mesoscale process (CAMP) process is reported to manufacture composites with a near&#8208;replica &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, that features a low volume shrinking (9.98%) during &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation. The CAMP manufactures carbon nanotubes (CNTs)/epoxy with a CNTs loading of 25&#160;wt% exhibiting a longitudinal compressive strength of 381 &#177; 30&#160;MPa.








Abstract
Nanocomposites containing nanoscale materials offer exciting opportunities to encode nanoscale features into macroscale dimensions, which produces unprecedented impact in material design and application. However,&#160;conventional methods cannot process nanocomposites with a high particle loading, as well as nanocomposites with the ability to be tailored at multiple scales. A&#160;composite architected mesoscale process strategy that brings particle loading nanoscale materials combined with multiscale features including nanoscale manipulation, mesoscale architecture, and macroscale formation to create spatially programmed nanocomposites with high particle loading and multiscale tailorability is reported. The process features a low&#8208;shrinking (&lt;10%) &#8220;green&#8208;to&#8208;brown&#8221; transformation, making a near&#8208;geometric replica of the 3D design to produce a &#8220;brown&#8221; part with full nanomaterials to allow further matrix infill. This demonstration includes additively manufactured carbon nanocomposites containing carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and thermoset epoxy, leading to multiscale CNTs tailorability, performance improvement, and 3D complex geometry feasibility. The&#160;process can produce nanomaterial&#8208;assembled architectures with 3D geometry and multiscale features and can incorporate a wide range of matrix materials, such as polymers, metals, and ceramics, to fabricate nanocomposites for new device structures and applications.

         <title>Exploring Electronic Characteristics of Acceptor&#8211;Donor&#8211;Acceptor&#8208;Type Molecules by Single&#8208;Molecule Charge Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through single&#8208;molecule detection, it is found that an acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone acceptor units exhibits enhanced conductance compared with the control donor molecule. Furthermore, the charge transport of the D central part is directly detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule.








Abstract
The electronic characteristics of organic optoelectronic materials determine the performance of corresponding devices. Clarifying the relationship between molecular structure and electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level can help to achieve high performance for organic optoelectronic materials and devices, especially for organic photovoltaics. In this work, a typical acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8211;D&#8211;A)&#8208;type molecule is explored by combining theoretical and experimental studies to reveal the intrinsic electronic characteristics at the single&#8208;molecule level. Specifically, the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule with 1,1&#8208;dicyano methylene&#8208;3&#8208;indanone (INCN) acceptor units exhibits an enhanced conductance in single&#8208;molecule junctions when compared with the control donor molecule, because the acceptor units of the A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8208;type molecule contribute additional transport channels. In addition, through opening the S&#8729;&#8729;&#8729;O noncovalent conformational lock by protonation to expose the &#8722;S anchoring sites, the charge transport of the D central part is detected, proving that the conductive orbitals contributed by the INCN acceptor groups can penetrate the whole A&#8211;D&#8211;A molecule. These results provide important insights into the development of high&#8208;performance organic optoelectronic materials and devices toward practical applications.

         <title>Cartilage Lacuna&#8208;Inspired Microcarriers Drive Hyaline Neocartilage Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Culturing large&#8208;scale chondrocytes with native phenotypes remains a noteworthy challenge for cartilage tissue engineering. In this work, a novel method to fabricate mimicking cartilage lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) using N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide (NHS)/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;(3&#8208;dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) with mechanotransductive conditions is presented. The data show the advanced capabilities of LHAMCs by presenting the uninterrupted, long&#8208;term culture of chondrocytes to generate an enlarged microtissue with robust chondrogenic capacity.








Abstract
Cartilage equivalents from hydrogels containing chondrocytes exhibit excellent potential in hyaline cartilage regeneration, yet current approaches have limited success at reconstituting the architecture to culture nondifferentiated chondrocytes in vitro. In this study, specially designed lacunar hyaluronic acid microcarriers (LHAMCs) with mechanotransductive conditions that rapidly form stable hyaluronic acid (HA) N&#8208;hydroxy succinimide ester (NHS&#8208;ester) are reported. Specifically, carboxyl&#8208;functionalized HA is linked to collagen type I via amide&#8208;crosslinking, and gas foaming produced by ammonium bicarbonate forms concave surface of the microcarriers. The temporal 3D culture of chondrocytes on LHAMCs uniquely remodels the extracellular matrix to induce hyaline cartilaginous microtissue regeneration and prevents an anaerobic&#8208;to&#8208;aerobic metabolism transition in response to the geometric constraints. Furthermore, by inhibiting the canonical Wnt pathway, LHAMCs prevent &#946;&#8208;catenin translocation to the nucleus, repressing chondrocyte dedifferentiation. Additionally, the subcutaneous implantation model indicates that LHAMCs display favorable cytocompatibility and drive robust hyaline chondrocyte&#8208;derived neocartilage formation. These findings reveal a novel strategy for regulating chondrocyte dedifferentiation. The current study paves the way for a better understanding of geometrical insight clues into mechanotransduction interaction in regulating cell fate, opening new avenues for advancing tissue engineering.

         <title>Constructing an Interfacial Gradient Heterostructure Enables Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells and Printed Minimodules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interfacial gradient heterostructure (denoted as BTA+&#8208;CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx) is constructed to simultaneously tune CsPbI3 perovskite defects and interfacial energy levels. This strategy can significantly suppress nonradiative recombination in perovskites and facilitate charge transfer in a device. An efficiency of 21.31% is achieved for CsPbI3 solar cells, and a record efficiency of 16.60% is demonstrated for printed inorganic CsPbI3 minimodules.








Abstract
Severe nonradiative recombination originating from interfacial defects together with the pervasive energy level mismatch at the interface remarkably limits the performance of CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These issues need to be addressed urgently for high&#8208;performance cells and their applications. Herein, an interfacial gradient heterostructure based on low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;treatment of quaternary bromide salts for efficient CsPbI3 PSCs with an impressive efficiency of 21.31% and an extraordinary fill factor of 0.854 is demonstrated. Further investigation reveals that Br&#8722; ions diffuse into the perovskite films to heal undercoordinated Pb2+ and inhibit Pb cluster formation, thus suppressing nonradiative recombination in CsPbI3. Meanwhile, a more compatible interfacial energy level alignment resulting from Br&#8722; gradient distribution and organic cations surface termination is also achieved, hence promoting charge separation and collection. Consequently, the printed small&#8208;size cell with an efficiency of 20.28% and 12 cm2 printed CsPbI3 minimodules with a record efficiency of 16.60% are also demonstrated. Moreover, the unencapsulated CsPbI3 films and devices exhibit superior stability.

         <title>Reversing Acute Kidney Injury through Coordinated Interplay of Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Iron Supplementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasmall nicotinamide&#8208;mononucleotide&#8208;modified Fe3O4 (Fe3O4@NMN) nanoprobe with renal targeting ability has been constructed for reversing AKI through instant release of NMN and slow degradation of Fe3O4 nanoparticles. The upregulation of the erythropoietin level as well as the iron level in bone marrow is demonstrated to promote the generation of red blood cells, which plays a key role in accelerating renal recovery.








Abstract
Acute kidney injury (AKI) induced by ischemia reperfusion is closely related to mitochondrial dysfunction. Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) can enhance the mitochondrial function and restrain the following inflammation, but it is hardly delivered and lacks renal targeting ability. To address these problems, herein, an ultrasmall Fe3O4 nanoparticle is used as a carrier to deliver nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), a precursor of NAD+. An outstanding sophistication of the current design is that once NMN is attached on the surface of Fe3O4 nanoparticles through its phosphate group, the remaining part is structurally highly similar to nicotinamide riboside, which provides an opportunity to deliver the NAD+ precursor into renal cells through nicotinamide riboside kinase 1 on the cell membrane. It is demonstrated that NMN&#8208;loaded Fe3O4 nanoparticles can effectively reverse AKI induced by ischemia reperfusion. In&#8208;depth studies indicate that a well&#8208;timed iron replenishment following anti&#8208;inflammation treatment plays a determined role in recovering AKI, which distinguishes the current study from previous strategies centering on anti&#8208;ROS (reactive oxygen species), anti&#8208;inflammation, or even iron elimination.

         <title>Interstitial Segregation has the Potential to Mitigate Liquid Metal Embrittlement in Iron</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;resolution probing techniques reveal the formation of a nanoscale segregation pattern of zinc in a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic iron grain boundary (GB) decorated by boron and carbon. Ab initio calculations show that boron and carbon hinder zinc segregation and compensate for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion.








Abstract
The embrittlement of metallic alloys by liquid metals leads to catastrophic material failure and severely impacts their structural integrity. The weakening of grain boundaries (GBs) by the ingress of liquid metal and preceding segregation in the solid are thought to promote early fracture. However, the potential of balancing between the segregation of cohesion&#8208;enhancing interstitial solutes and embrittling elements inducing GB de&#8208;cohesion is not understood. Here, the mechanisms of how boron segregation mitigates the detrimental effects of the prime embrittler, zinc, in a &#931;5&#8201;[001] tilt GB in &#945;&#8208;Fe (4 at.% Al) is unveiled. Zinc forms nanoscale segregation patterns inducing structurally and compositionally complex GB states. Ab initio simulations reveal that boron hinders zinc segregation and compensates for the zinc&#8208;induced loss in GB cohesion. The work sheds new light on how interstitial solutes intimately modify GBs, thereby opening pathways to use them as dopants for preventing disastrous material failure.

         <title>Universal Renaissance Strategy of Metal Fluoride in Secondary Ion Batteries Enabled by Liquid Metal Gallium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic limitations of metal fluorides can be solved by simply introducing GaF3. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;generated liquid Ga provides highly conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure activates Li&#63743;F splitting. The lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 can be significantly increased by 87%, while the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity of FeF3 can be increased by 33%.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state alkali ion batteries represent a future trend in battery technology, as well as provide an opportunity for low&#8208;cost metal fluoride electrode materials, if certain intrinsic problems can be resolved. In this work, a liquid metal activation strategy is proposed in which liquid Ga elements are generated in situ and doped into the LiF crystal structure by introducing a small amount of GaF3. Benefiting from these two Ga states of existence, in which the liquid metal Ga can continuously maintain conformable ion/electron&#8208;transport networks, while doped Ga in the LiF crystal structure catalyzes Li&#63743;F splitting, the lithium&#8208;ion storage capacity of MnF2 significantly increases&#160;by 87%. A similar effect can be obtained in FeF3, where the sodium&#8208;ion storage capacity is enhanced by 33%. This universal strategy with few restrictions can be used to realize a complete renaissance of metal fluorides, as well as offer an opportunity for the new application of liquid metals in the field of energy storage.

         <title>Understanding the Interfacial Reactions and Band Alignment for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells Built on Metal Substrates with Reduced Upscaling Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new understanding and architecture enabling efficient and stable perovskite solar cells built on metal substrates is presented. The efficiency and fill&#8208;factor losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for upscaling and module design.








Abstract
Conventional perovskite solar cells (PSC) built on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) glass face a fundamental challenge to retain fill factor (FF) for large&#8208;area upscaling due to series resistance loss. Building a perovskite solar cell on metal has the potential to reduce this FF loss and is promising for flexible applications. However, their efficiency and stability lag far behind their TCO counterparts. Herein, findings on the complex chemical reactions and degradation&#8208;promoting processes at different perovskite/metal (Cu, Au, Ag, and Mo) interfaces, which are closely linked with the inherent stability; and the interlayer engineering for perovskite/metal interface's band alignment, which plays an essential role in achieving high efficiency, are reported. Leveraging these findings, 21% power conversion efficiency (PCE) is achieved for 1 cm2 perovskite solar cells using a p&#8211;i&#8211;n top&#8208;illumination structure on a molybdenum substrate, the highest reported for a PSC built on metal. Notably, the FF and PCE losses due to area upscaling are remarkably reduced by one order of magnitude relative to the counterparts on conventional TCO glass, highlighting an alternative pathway for PSC upscaling and module design.

Abstract
Sluggish reaction kinetics and severe shuttling effect of lithium polysulfides seriously hinder the development of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Heterostructures, due to unique properties, have congenital advantages that are difficult to be achieved by single&#8208;component materials in regulating lithium polysulfides by efficient catalysis and strong adsorption to solve the problems of poor reaction kinetics and serious shuttling effect of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. In this review, the principles of heterostructures expediting lithium polysulfides conversion and anchoring lithium polysulfides are detailly analyzed, and the application of heterostructures as sulfur host, interlayer, and separator modifier to improve the performance of lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are systematically reviewed. Finally, the problems that need to be solved in the future study and application of heterostructures in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries are prospected. This review will provide a valuable reference for the development of heterostructures in advanced lithium sulfur batteries.

         <title>Fundamentals of Skin Bioimpedances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The bioimpedances of tissues beyond the stratum corneum, which is the outermost layer of skin, contain crucial clinical information. Nevertheless, bioimpedance measurements of both the viable skin and the adipose tissue, though easy and innocuous, are not widely used, mainly because of the complex multi&#8208;layered skin structure and of the electrically insulating nature of the stratum corneum. Here, first, we establish a theoretical framework for analyzing the impedances of multi&#8208;layered tissues and apply it to skin. Afterwards, we determine strategies for the system&#8208;level design of electrodes and electronics which minimize 4&#8208;wire (or tetrapolar) measurement errors even in presence of a top insulating tissue, thus enabling non&#8208;invasive characterizations of tissues beyond the stratum corneum. As an example, we demonstrate non&#8208;invasive measurements of bioimpedances of living tissues which are beyond orders&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude (e.g., up to 350 times) higher stratum corneum impedances independently on extreme variations of the barrier (tape stripping) or of the skin&#8208;electrodes contact impedances (sweat). Our results can advance the development of bioimpedance systems enabling the characterization of viable skin and adipose tissues for several applications, including transdermal drug delivery and the assessment of skin cancer, obesity, dehydration, type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular risk and multipotent adult stem cells.

         <title>Ultrafast Electrical Pulse Synthesis of Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level Hydrogen Gas Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high reliability and proven ultra&#8208;longevity make aqueous hydrogen gas (H2) batteries ideal for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the low alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) activities of expensive platinum catalyst severely hampered its widespread applications in the H2 batteries. Here, cost&#8208;effective, highly active electrocatalysts, with a model of ruthenium&#8208;nickel alloy nanoparticles in &#8764;3&#160;nm anchored on carbon black (RuNi/C) as an example, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level nickel&#8208;hydrogen gas (Ni&#8211;H2) batteries. Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benchmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mV (versus RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. As a result, the advanced Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery can efficiently operate under all&#8208;climate conditions (from &#8208;25 to +50 &#176;C). In addition, this battery shows an excellent durability with negligible capacity and efficiency decay over 1500 cycles at various current densities from 5 to 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Notably, the Ni&#8211;H2 (RuNi) battery achieves an cell&#8208;level energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)2 loading of 280&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 (60 mAh cm&#8722;2) and a low anode Ru loading of &#8764;62.5&#160;&#956;g cm&#8722;2, thereby reaching an estimated cost of the cell stack as low as &#8764;$49.1 kWh&#8722;1, much superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Ni&#8211;H2 batteries and lithium iron phosphate batteries. The advanced beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>A personalized cancer vaccine that induces synergistic innate and adaptive immune responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To demonstrate potent efficacy, a cancer vaccine needs to activate both innate and adaptive immune cells. Personalized cancer vaccine strategies often require the identification of patient&#8208;specific neoantigens; however, the clonal and mutational heterogeneity of cancer cells presents inherent challenges. Here, we present&#160;extracellular nanovesicles&#160;derived from&#160;alpha&#8208;galactosylceramide&#8208;conjugated autologous acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells (ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC)&#160;as a personalized therapeutic vaccine that activates both innate and adaptive immune responses, bypassing the need to identify patient&#8208;specific neoantigens. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination directly engaged with and activated both invariant natural killer T (iNKT) cells and leukemia&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells in mice with AML, thereby promoting long&#8208;term anti&#8208;leukemic immune memory. ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC sufficiently served as an antigen&#8208;presenting platform that could directly activate antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells even in the absence of dendritic cells, thereby demonstrating a multi&#8208;faceted cellular mechanism of immune activation. Moreover, ECNV&#8208;&#945;GC vaccination resulted in a significantly lower AML burden and higher percentage of leukemia&#8208;free survivors among cytarabine&#8208;treated hosts with AML. Human AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs activated iNKT cells in both healthy individuals and patients with AML regardless of responsiveness to conventional therapies. Together, autologous AML&#8208;derived ECNV&#8208;&#945;GCs may be a promising personalized therapeutic vaccine that efficiently establishes AML&#8208;specific long&#8208;term immunity without requiring the identification of neoantigens.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely large magnetoresistance ratio is demonstrated in oxide&#8208;based lateral spin&#8208;valve devices, where a nonmagnetic nanochannel is made by implementing the metal&#8211;insulator transition in a nanoscale region of a La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 thin layer with Ar ion irradiation. The current is successfully modulated by applying the gate voltage. These are promising results for realizing oxide&#8208;based spin transistors.








Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8776;140% is demonstrated for planar-type (La,Sr)MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSMO)-based spin-valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor-based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott-insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott-insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Aqueous Organic Batteries Using Proton as Charge Carrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Benefiting from the merits of low cost, non&#8208;flammability and high operational safety, aqueous rechargeable batteries have emerged as promising candidates for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications. Among various metal&#8208;ion/non&#8208;metallic charge carriers, proton (H+) as a charge carrier possesses numerous unique properties such as a fast proton diffusion dynamics, a low molar mass and a small hydrated ion radius, which endow aqueous proton batteries (APBs) with a salient rate capability, a long&#8208;term life span and an excellent low&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance. In addition, redox&#8208;active organic molecules, with the advantages of structural diversity, rich proton&#8208;storage sites and abundant resources, are considered as attractive electrode materials for APBs. However, as far as application is concerned, the charge storage and transport mechanisms of organic electrodes in APBs is still in infancy. Therefore, finding suitable electrode materials and uncovering the H+ storage mechanisms are significant for the applications of organic materials in APBs. Herein, the latest research progresses on organic materials such as small molecules and polymers for APBs are reviewed. Furthermore, a comprehensive summary and evaluation of APBs employing organic electrodes as anode and/or cathode is provided, especially on their low&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;power performances, along with systematic discussions for guiding the rational design and the construction of APBs based on organic electrodes.

         <title>Flame Aerosol Synthesis of Metal Sulfides at High Temperature in Oxygen&#8208;Lean Atmosphere</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, the preparation of various metal sulfides in a flame process using single&#8208;droplet combustion and enclosed flame spray pyrolysis in O2&#8208;lean condition is demonstrated. Using a large&#8208;tube reactor MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are formed at a rate of 5 g h&#8722;1. The flame aerosol process is a key toward scalable synthesis of binary/ternary metal sulfides for next&#8208;generation functional materials.








Abstract
The development of a novel reactive spray technology based on the well&#8208;known gas&#8208;phase metal oxide synthesis route provides innumerable opportunities for the production of non&#8208;oxide nanoparticles. Among these materials, metal sulfides are expected to have a high impact, especially in the development of electrochemical and photochemical high&#8208;surface&#8208;area materials. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle, MnS, CoS, Cu2S, ZnS, Ag2S, In2S3, SnS, and Bi2S3 are synthesized in an O2&#8208;lean and sulfur&#8208;rich environment. In addition, the formation of Cu2S in a single&#8208;droplet combustion experiment is reported. The multiscale approach combining flame sprays with single&#8208;droplet combustion is expected to pave the way toward a fundamental understanding of the gas&#8208;phase formation of metal sulfides in the future. The knowledge acquired can open the possibility for the development of a next&#8208;generation gas&#8208;phase technology facilitating the scalable synthesis of functional binary/ternary metal sulfides.

         <title>Precise Strain Tuning Boosts Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Strain engineering has been utilized as an effective approach to regulate the binding of reaction intermediates and modify catalytic behavior on noble metal nanocatalysts. However, the continuous, precise control of strain for a depiction of strain&#8208;activity correlation remains a challenge. Herein, Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir overlayers are constructed, and subject to different post&#8208;synthetic treatments to alter the amount of H intercalated into Pd core for achieving three different surface strains (o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.2%, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7%, and o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;2.1% NPs). We demonstrate that the catalytic performances on o&#8208;Pd/Ir NPs display a volcano&#8208;shaped curve against strains towards hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7% NPs exhibit superior catalytic performance with a mass activity of 9.38 A mgIr&#8211;1 at &#8211;0.02&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), 10.8&#8208; and 18.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, making it one of the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Density function theory (DFT) calculations verify that the moderate tensile strain on Ir(111) surfaces plays a pivotal role in optimizing the H binding energy. This work highlights a new strategy for the precise control over surface strain of nanocrystal for more efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Kinetics on Perovskite Oxides via Oxygen Vacancies for Low&#8208;Temperature and Knittable Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High kinetics oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts under low temperature are critical and highly desired for temperature&#8208;tolerant energy conversion and storage devices, but remain insufficiently investigated. Herein, oxygen vacancy&#8208;rich porous perovskite oxide (CaMnO3) nanofibers coated with reduced graphene oxide coating (V&#8208;CMO/rGO) are developed as the air electrode catalyst for low&#8208;temperature and knittable Zn&#8208;air batteries. V&#8208;CMO/rGO exhibits top&#8208;level ORR activity among perovskite oxides and shows impressive kinetics under low temperature. Experimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the synergistic effect between metal atoms and oxygen vacancies, as well as the accelerated kinetics, enhanced electric conductivity and mass transfer over the rGO coated nanofiber 3D network contribute to the enhanced catalytic activity. The desorption of ORR intermediate is promoted by the regulated electron filling. The V&#8208;CMO/rGO drives knittable and flexible Zn&#8208;air batteries under a low temperature of &#8208;40 &#176;C with high peak power density of 56 mW cm&#8722;2 and long cycle life of over 80 h. This study provides insight of kinetically active catalyst and facilitates the ZABs application in harsh environment.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. Herein, we report an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibited dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping had considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>Specific Clearance of Lipopolysaccharide from Blood Based on Peptide Bottlebrush Polymer for Sepsis Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the primary bacterial toxin that is vital to the pathogenesis and progression of sepsis associated with extremely high morbidity and mortality worldwide. However, specific clearance of LPS from circulating blood is highly challenging because of the structural complexity and its variation between/within bacterial species. Herein, we propose a robust strategy based on phage display screening and hemocompatible peptide bottlebrush polymer design for specific clearance of targeted LPS from circulating blood. Using LPS extracted from E. coli as an example, we discover a novel peptide (HWKAVNWLKPWT) with high affinity (KD &lt; 1.0 n&#1084;), specificity, and neutralization activity (95.9 &#177; 0.1%) against the targeted LPS via iterative affinity selection coupled with endotoxin detoxification&#160;screening. A hemocompatible bottlebrush polymer bearing the short peptide [poly(PEGMEA&#8208;co&#8208;PEP&#8208;1)] exhibits high LPS selectivity to reduce circulating LPS level from 2.63 &#177; 0.01 to 0.78 &#177; 0.05 EU/mL in sepsis rabbits via extracorporeal hemoperfusion (LPS clearrance ratio &gt; 70%), reversing the LPS&#8208;induced leukocytopenia and multiple organ damages significantly. This work provides a universal paradigm for developing a highly selective hemoadsorbent library fully covering the LPS family, which is promising to create a new era of precision medicine in sepsis therapy.

         <title>Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with an External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 30%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are strong candidates for next&#8208;generation display and lighting technologies due to their high color purity and low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;processed fabrication. However, PeLEDs are not superior to commercial organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) in efficiency, as some key parameters affecting their efficiency, such as the charge carrier transport and light outcoupling efficiency, are usually overlooked and not well optimized. Here, we report ultrahigh&#8208;efficiency green PeLEDs with quantum efficiencies surpassing a milestone of 30% by regulating the charge carrier transport and near&#8208;field light distribution to reduce electron leakage and achieve a high light outcoupling efficiency of 41.82%. We apply Ni0.9Mg0.1Ox films with a high refractive index and increased hole carrier mobility as the hole injection layer to balance the charge carrier injection and insert the polyethylene glycol layer between the hole transport layer and the perovskite emissive layer to block the electron leakage and reduce the photon loss. Therefore, with the modified structure, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art green PeLEDs achieve a world&#8208;record external quantum efficiency of 30.84% (average&#8201; = &#8201;29.05 &#177; 0.77%) at a luminance of 6514&#160;cd/m2. This work provides an interesting idea to construct super high&#8208;efficiency PeLEDs by balancing the electron&#8208;hole recombination and enhancing the light outcoupling.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted an increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, we demonstrate the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and 3D triangular crystals formed by the reaction between ultra&#8208;thin films of MoO3 grown by Pulsed Laser Deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment. The multilayer nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#956;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer edges, forming a monolayer&#8208;multilayer MoS2 junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges of the nanoribbons show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A pronounced splitting of the Raman spectra was observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the monolayer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the triangular MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#215;102 A/W at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. Our findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Se Nano&#8208;Powder Conversion into Lubricious 2D Selenide Layers by Tribochemical Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) coatings have attracted enormous scientific and industrial interest due to their outstanding tribological behavior. The paradigmatic example is MoS2, even though selenides and tellurides have demonstrated superior tribological properties. Here, we describe an innovative in&#8208;operando conversion of Se nano&#8208;powders into lubricious 2D selenides by sprinkling them onto sliding metallic surfaces coated with Mo and W thin films. Advanced material characterization confirms the tribochemical formation of a thin tribofilm containing selenides, reducing the coefficient of friction down to below 0.1 in ambient air, levels typically reached using fully formulated oils. Ab initio molecular dynamics simulations under tribological conditions reveal the atomistic mechanisms that result in shear&#8208;induced synthesis of selenide monolayers from nano&#8208;powders. The use of Se nano&#8208;powder provides thermal stability and prevents outgassing in vacuum environments. Additionally, the high reactivity of the Se nano&#8208;powder with the transition metal coating in the conditions prevailing in the contact interface yields highly reproducible results, making it particularly suitable for the replenishment of sliding components with solid lubricants, avoiding the long&#8208;lasting problem of TMD&#8208;lubricity degradation caused by environmental molecules. The suggested straightforward approach demonstrates an unconventional and smart way to synthesize TMDs in&#8208;operando and exploit their friction&#8208; and wear reducing impact.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Soft Organogel Artificial Muscles Exhibiting High Power Density, Large Stroke, Fast Response and Long&#8208;Term Durability in Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A organogel artificial muscle is created through combining rational macromolecular design and twist insertion. Such tissue&#8208;like material (Young's modulus&#160;=&#160;133&#160;kPa) can generate ultra&#8208;large actuation strain (66%), ultra&#8208;fast actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), high power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), high actuation stress (0.23&#160;MPa), excellent work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), and highly stable actuation in the open&#8208;air environment.








Abstract
Polymeric gel&#8208;based artificial muscles exhibiting tissue&#8208;matched Young's modulus (10&#160;Pa&#8211;1&#160;MPa) promise to be core components in future soft machines with inherently safe human&#8208;machine interactions. However, the ability to simultaneously generate fast, large, high&#8208;power, and long&#8208;lasting actuation in the open&#8208;air environment, has yet been demonstrated in this class of ultra&#8208;soft materials. Herein, to overcome this hurdle, the design and synthesis of a twisted and coiled liquid crystalline glycerol&#8208;organogel (TCLCG) is reported. Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&#8722;1), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;3), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co&#8208;solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments is successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&#8722;1) in a small&#8208;confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.

Such material with a low Young's modulus of 133&#160;kPa can surpass the actuation performance of skeletal muscles in a variety of aspects, including actuation strain (66%), actuation rate (275%&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), power density (438&#160;kW&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and work capacity (105&#160;kJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Notably, its power density is 14 times higher than the record of state-of-the-art polymeric gels. No actuation performance degradation is detected in the TCLCG even after air exposure for 7 days, owing to the excellent water retention ability enabled by glycerol as co-solvent with water. Using TCLCG, mobile soft robots with extraordinary maneuverability in unstructured environments is successfully demonstrated, including a crawler showing fast bidirectional locomotion (0.50&#160;mm&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) in a small-confined space, and a roller that can escape after deep burying in sand.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale observation directly shows that a significant amount of oxygen loss is induced exclusively by lattice strain in pristine layered oxides without any electrochemical Li extraction under high voltage application. This work offers crucial insight toward the importance of strain relaxation to suppress oxygen loss for better cycling performance of layered oxide cathodes.








Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release, and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading are critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it is fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release will be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content are scrutinized. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#63743;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structural changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Ultralong Carrier Lifetime Exceeding 20 &#181;s in Lead Halide Perovskite Film Enable Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By regulating the electronic structure with ThFABr, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m is achieved in 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite films. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices yielding a champion efficiency of 24.69% and a high VOC of 1.21&#160;V, coupled with significantly improved operational stability.








Abstract
The carrier lifetime is one of the key parameters for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, it is still a great challenge to achieve long carrier lifetimes in perovskite films that are comparable with perovskite crystals owning to the large trap density resulting from the unavoidable defects in grain boundaries and surfaces. Here, by regulating the electronic structure with the developed 2&#8208;thiopheneformamidinium bromide (ThFABr) combined with the unique film structure of 2D perovskite layer caped 2D/3D polycrystalline perovskite film, an ultralong carrier lifetime exceeding 20 &#181;s and carrier diffusion lengths longer than 6.5&#160;&#181;m are achieved. These excellent properties enable the ThFA&#8208;based devices to yield a champion efficiency of 24.69% with a minimum VOC loss of 0.33&#160;V. The unencapsulated device retains &#8776;95% of its initial efficiency after 1180&#160;h by max power point (MPP) tracking under continuous light illumination. This work provides important implications for structured 2D/(2D/3D) perovskite films combined with unique FA&#8208;based spacers to achieve ultralong carrier lifetime for high&#8208;performance PSCs and other optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Toward Electrocatalytic Methanol Oxidation Reaction: Longstanding Debates and Emerging Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intense debates, recent developments, and limitations of the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) are summarized,&#160;regarding the catalytic mechanism, evaluation criteria, and advanced electrocatalysts. Perspectives on the mechanisms study and electrocatalysts design are also proposed. This review will guide directions for boosting the understanding of catalytic mechanism and exploring efficient electrocatalysts for MOR.








Abstract
The study of direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) has lasted around 70 years, since the first investigation in the early 1950s. Though enormous effort has been devoted in this field, it is still far from commercialization. The methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), as a semi&#8208;reaction of DMFCs, is the bottleneck reaction that restricts the overall performance of DMFCs. To date, there has been&#160;intense debate on the complex six&#8208;electron reaction, but barely any reviews have systematically discussed this topic. To this end, the controversies and progress regarding the electrocatalytic mechanisms, performance evaluations as well as the design science toward MOR electrocatalysts are summarized. This review also provides a comprehensive introduction on the recent development of emerging MOR electrocatalysts with a focus on the innovation of the alloy, core&#8211;shell structure, heterostructure, and single&#8208;atom catalysts. Finally, perspectives on the future outlook toward study of the mechanisms and design of electrocatalysts are provided.

         <title>Metallic Glass&#8208;Fiber Fabrics: A New Type of Flexible, Super&#8208;Lightweight, and 3D Current Collector for Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs) is a new type of super&#8208;lightweight, strong, flexible, electrochemically and thermally stable, and fire&#8208;resistant current collector. It displays great practical potential in the area of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible batteries. Replacing metal foils with MGFs can not only improve the energy density of lithium batteries by 9&#8211;18%, but also endow lithium batteries with outstanding flexible attributes.








Abstract
Current collectors are indispensable parts that provide electron transport and mechanical support of electrode materials in a battery. Nowadays, thin metal foils made of Cu and Al are used as current collectors of lithium batteries, but they do not contribute to the storage capacity. Therefore, decreasing the weight of current collectors can directly enhance the energy density of a battery. However, limited by the requirements of mechanical strength, it is difficult to reduce the weight of metal foils any further. Herein, a new type of current collectors made of 3D metallic glass&#8208;fiber fabrics (MGFs), which shows advantages of super&#8208;lightweight (2.9&#8211;3.2&#160;mg cm&#8315;2), outstanding electrochemical stability for cathodes and anodes of lithium&#8208;ion and lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), fire resistance, high strength, and flexibility suitable for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll electrode fabrication is reported. The gravimetric energy densities of lithium batteries exhibit improvements of 9&#8211;18% by only replacing the metal foils with the MGFs. In addition, MGFs are suitable for the fabrication of flexible batteries. A high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium battery with an outstanding figure of merit of flexible battery (fbFOM) and flexing stability is demonstrated.

         <title>Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali&#8208;Functionalized Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb&#8208;PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.









Abstract
The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI3&#8208;rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali&#8208;functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)&#8208;functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI3 perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb2+) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb2+.

     alt="Stabilization of FAPbI3 with Multifunctional Alkali-Functionalized Polymer"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new strategy to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali-functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution is reported. Rubidium-functionalized poly(acrylic acid) (Rb-PAA) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% with enhanced operational stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The defects located at the interfaces and grain boundaries (GBs) of perovskite films are detrimental to the photovoltaic performance and stability of perovskite solar cells. Manipulating the perovskite crystallization process and tailoring the interfaces with molecular passivators are the main effective strategies to mitigate performance loss and instability. Herein, a new strategy is reported to manipulate the crystallization process of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-rich perovskite by incorporating a small amount of alkali-functionalized polymers into the antisolvent solution. The synergic effects of the alkali cations and poly(acrylic acid) anion effectively passivate the defects on the surface and GBs of perovskite films. As a result, the rubidium (Rb)-functionalized poly(acrylic acid) significantly improves the power conversion efficiency of FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite solar cells to approaching 25% and reduces the risk of lead ion (Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) leakage continuously&#160;via the strong interaction between C&#63742;O bonds and Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the unencapsulated device shows enhanced operational stability, retaining 80% of its initial efficiency after 500&#160;h operation at maximum power point under one-sun illumination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering of Sorption&#8208;Based Atmospheric Water Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential applications for atmospheric water harvesting are tantalizing. This review provides an up&#8208;to&#8208;date summary of the most recent developments and challenges for developing practical sorption&#8208;based atmospheric&#8208;water harvesters. The sorbent design at the nanoscale, condensation enhancement at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale, and water scarcity assessments at the global scale are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Harvesting water from air in sorption&#8208;based devices is a promising solution to decentralized water production, aiming for providing potable water anywhere, anytime. This technology involves a series of coupled processes occurring at distinct length scales, ranging from nanometer to meter and even larger, including water sorption/desorption at the nanoscale, condensation at the mesoscale, device development at the macroscale and water scarcity assessment at the global scale. Comprehensive understanding and bespoke designs at every scale are thus needed to improve the water&#8208;harvesting performance. For this purpose, a brief introduction of the global water crisis and its key characteristics is provided to clarify the impact potential and design criteria of water harvesters. Next the latest molecular&#8208;level optimizations of sorbents for efficient moisture capture and release are discussed. Then, novel microstructuring of surfaces to enhance dropwise condensation, which is favorable for atmospheric water generation, is shown. After that, system&#8208;level optimizations of sorbent&#8208;assisted water harvesters to achieve high&#8208;yield, energy&#8208;efficient, and low&#8208;cost water harvesting are highlighted. Finally, future directions toward practical sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting are outlined.

         <title>A Highly Robust Amphibious Soft Robot with Imperceptibility Based on a Water&#8208;Stable and Self&#8208;Healing Ionic Conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely engineering the molecular structure and introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interaction, a soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed. With this electrode material, a 50&#8208;time DEA lifetime and excellent underwater stability are achieved. Based on the synthesized electrode, the first highly robust, amphibious DEA&#8208;driven soft robot with imperceptibility is demonstrated.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are widely exploited for actuating soft machines and granting soft robots with capability to operate in both underwater and on&#8208;land environments is important to make them adapt to more complex situations. Here, a DEA&#8208;driven, highly robust, amphibious imperceptible soft robot (AISR) based on an all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductive material is presented. A soft, self&#8208;healable, all&#8208;environment stable ionic conductor is developed by introducing cooperative ion&#8211;dipole interactions to provide underwater stability as well as efficient suppression of ion penetration. By tuning molecular structures of the material, a 50&#8208;time device lifetime increase compared with unmodified [EMI][TFSI]&#8208;based devices and excellent underwater actuating performance is achieved. With the synthesized ionic electrode, the DEA&#8208;driven soft robot exhibits amphibious functionality to traverse hydro&#8208;terrestrial regions. When encountering damage, the robot shows good resilience and can self&#8208;heal underwater and it also exhibits imperceptibility to light, sound, and heat.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Mid&#8208;Infrared Spectrochemical Imaging of Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metasurface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral tissue imaging method is developed to advance quantitative functional biomolecule mapping in brain tissue sections. Probing nanoscale tissue volumes via metasurface&#8208;localized strong electromagnetic fields, this imaging modality isolates the molecular composition information from the bulk physical properties of the tissue sections. The approach increases the sensitivity and selectivity of molecular fingerprint retrieval enhancing the chemical image contrast and enabling detection of ultrathin tissue regions.









Abstract
Label&#8208;free and nondestructive mid&#8208;infrared vibrational hyperspectral imaging is an essential tissue analysis tool, providing spatially resolved biochemical information critical to understanding physiological and pathological processes. However, the chemically complex and spatially heterogeneous composition of tissue specimens and the inherently weak interaction of infrared light with biomolecules limit the analytical performance of infrared absorption spectroscopy. Here, an advanced mid&#8208;infrared spectrochemical tissue imaging modality is introduced using metasurfaces that support strong surface&#8208;localized electromagnetic fields to capture quantitative molecular maps of large&#8208;area murine brain tissue sections. The approach leverages polarization&#8208;multiplexed multi&#8208;resonance plasmonic metasurfaces to simultaneously detect various functional biomolecules. The surface&#8208;enhanced mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging method eliminates the non&#8208;specific effects of bulk tissue morphology on quantitative spectral analysis and improves chemical selectivity. This study shows that metasurface enhancement increases the retrieval of amide I and II bands associated with protein secondary structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated that plasmonic metasurfaces enhance the chemical contrast in infrared images and enable detection of ultrathin tissue regions that are not otherwise visible to conventional mid&#8208;infrared spectral imaging. While this work uses murine brain tissue sections, the&#160;chemical imaging method is well&#8208;suited for other tissue types, which broadens its potential impact for translational research and clinical histopathology.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest achievements in the synthesis, characterization, and photocatalysis of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) are summarized. A brief introduction of the fundamentals and fabrication approaches of SACs and DACs is given, followed by highlighting the diverse applications of non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal SACs and DACs in solar&#8208;driven artificial photosynthesis. The review ends with relevant opportunities, challenges, and perspectives.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis enables direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion aimed at mitigating environmental pollution and producing solar fuels and chemicals in a green and sustainable approach, and efficient, robust, and low&#8208;cost photocatalysts are the heart of artificial photosynthesis systems. As an emerging new class of cocatalytic materials, single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) have received a great deal of current attention due to their maximal atom utilization and unique photocatalytic properties, whereas noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free ones impart abundance, availability, and cost&#8208;effectiveness allowing for scalable implementation. This review outlines the fundamental principles and synthetic methods of SACs and DACs and summarizes the most recent advances in SACs (Co, Fe, Cu, Ni, Bi, Al, Sn, Er, La, Ba, etc.) and DACs (CuNi, FeCo, InCu, KNa, CoCo, CuCu, etc.) based on non&#8208;noble metals, confined on an arsenal of organic or inorganic substrates (polymeric carbon nitride, metal oxides, metal sulfides, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, carbon, etc.) acting as versatile scaffolds in solar&#8208;light&#8208;driven photocatalytic reactions, including hydrogen evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, methane conversion, organic synthesis, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and environmental remediation. The review concludes with the challenges, opportunities, and future prospects of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free SACs and DACs for artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Multifunctional Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks Capsules Modulate Reactivity of Lead Iodide toward Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with UV Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The introduction of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8@formamidinium iodide multifunctional capsules induces porous channels within the lead iodide layer, facilitating the nucleation of perovskite nuclei and improving the light utilization through down&#8208;conversion effect. The utilization of this approach has resulted in a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.08%, along with enhanced long&#8208;term stability under UV and humid conditions.








Abstract
The two&#8208;step sequential deposition process is demonstrated as a reliable technology for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the complete conversion of dense PbI2 to perovskite in planar PVSCs is tough without mesoporous titanium dioxide as support. Herein, multifunctional capsules consisting of zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) encapsulant and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are introduced between tin oxide (SnO2) and lead iodide (PbI2) layer. Intriguingly, the capsule dopant interlayer benefits the formation of porous PbI2 film due to the porous nanostructure of ZIF&#8208;8 that is favorable for the subsequent intercalation reaction. Furthermore, the constituent of the perovskite precursor in ZIF&#8208;8 pores can convert into the crystal nuclei of perovskite by reacting with PbI2 first, thereby promoting further perovskite crystallization. Significantly, the incorporation of ZIF&#8208;8 can enhance the resistance of perovskite against UV illumination due to down&#8208;conversion effect. Consequently, the modified device achieves a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.08% and displays enhanced UV stability, which can sustain 83% of its original PCE under 365&#160;nm UV illumination for 300&#160;h. Moreover, the unencapsulated device maintains 90% of initial PCE after 1500&#160;h storage in dark ambient conditions with a relative humidity range of 50%&#8211;70%.

&lt;p&gt;The introduction of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8@formamidinium iodide multifunctional capsules induces porous channels within the lead iodide layer, facilitating the nucleation of perovskite nuclei and improving the light utilization through down-conversion effect. The utilization of this approach has resulted in a champion power conversion efficiency of 24.08%, along with enhanced long-term stability under UV and humid conditions.

&lt;p&gt;The two-step sequential deposition process is demonstrated as a reliable technology for the fabrication of efficient perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). However, the complete conversion of dense PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to perovskite in planar PVSCs is tough without mesoporous titanium dioxide as support. Herein, multifunctional capsules consisting of zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8) encapsulant and formamidinium iodide (FAI) are introduced between tin oxide (SnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and lead iodide (PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) layer. Intriguingly, the capsule dopant interlayer benefits the formation of porous PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film due to the porous nanostructure of ZIF-8 that is favorable for the subsequent intercalation reaction. Furthermore, the constituent of the perovskite precursor in ZIF-8 pores can convert into the crystal nuclei of perovskite by reacting with PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; first, thereby promoting further perovskite crystallization.

         <title>Interfacial&#8208;Catalysis&#8208;Enabled Layered and Inorganic&#8208;Rich SEI on Hard Carbon Anodes in Ester Electrolytes for Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interface catalysis mechanism is developed to controllably design a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) on hard carbon anodes in ester electrolytes by surface&#8208;reconstruction with abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds, which are active centers for preferentially catalyzing salt reduction. Due to such rationally regulated SEI, sodium&#8208;storage performance regarding initial Columbic efficiency, rate capability, and cycling stability is comprehensively enhanced.








Abstract
Constructing a homogenous and inorganic&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interface (SEI) can efficiently improve the overall sodium&#8208;storage performance of hard carbon (HC) anodes. However, the thick and heterogenous SEI derived from conventional ester electrolytes fails to meet the above requirements. Herein, an innovative interfacial catalysis mechanism is proposed to design a favorable SEI in ester electrolytes by reconstructing the surface functionality of HC, of which abundant C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds are accurately and homogenously implanted. The C&#63742;O (carbonyl) bonds act as active centers that controllably catalyze the preferential reduction of salts and directionally guide SEI growth to form a homogenous, layered, and inorganic&#8208;rich SEI. Therefore, excessive solvent decomposition is suppressed, and the interfacial Na+ transfer and structural stability of SEI on HC anodes are greatly promoted, contributing to a comprehensive enhancement in sodium&#8208;storage performance. The optimal anodes exhibit an outstanding reversible capacity (379.6 mAh g&#8722;1), an ultrahigh initial Coulombic efficiency (93.2%), a largely improved rate capability, and an extremely stable cycling performance with a capacity decay rate of 0.0018% for 10&#8239;000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work provides novel insights into smart regulation of interface chemistry to realize high&#8208;performance HC anodes for sodium storage.

         <title>A 0D Additive&#160;for Flexible All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells to Go Beyond 60&#160;000 Flexible Cycles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;mechanical&#8208;durability flexible all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cell (PSCs) constructed by way of a 0D/3D mixed&#8208;dimensional structure is designed. The 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive effectively prevents the expansion of cracks during the bending process and enhances the efficiency of the all&#8208;inorganic flexible PSCs. This study provides a new route for further exploration of improving the mechanical durability of flexible all&#8208;inorganic PSCs.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic cesium lead halide flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) exhibit superior thermal stability compared to their organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid counterparts. However, their flexibility and efficiency are still below&#8208;par for practical viability. Herein, a design using a 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 additive to transform tensile stress into compressive stress in the perovskite film, effectively preventing expansion of cracks for significantly improved mechanical durability, is reported. It is found that not only is improved flexibility obtained, but also the cell efficiency is increased for the all&#8208;inorganic flexible 3D CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx solar cells. The CsPbI2.81Br0.19 f&#8208;PSC retains over 97% of its initial efficiency even after 60&#160;000 flexing cycles at a curvature radius of 5&#160;mm (R = 5&#160;mm). Simultaneously, 0D Cs4Pb(IBr)6 enhances the crystallinity of the CsPbI2.81Br0.19 film and passivates the defects along the grain boundaries, effectively improving the photovoltaic performance of the all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs. The highest power&#8208;conversion efficiency obtained is 14.25% with a short&#8208;circuit current density of 18.47&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.09&#160;V, and fill factor of 70.67%. This strategy paves the way for further improvement of the mechanical durability of all&#8208;inorganic f&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Enriched Hollow Porous Carbon Nanocages Enable Highly Efficient Chlorine Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocages with a controlled oxygen electronic state around the designed carbon defects are fabricated through a hard template strategy for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER). The electron density around the unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. The optimum HPC nanocages with lowest defective degree show excellent electrocatalytic performance for the CER.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free carbon&#8208;based catalysts are crucial for the electrocatalytic chlorine evolution reaction (CER) to reduce the usage of noble metals and industrial cost. However, the corresponding catalytic activity of high overpotential and low durability hinders their wide application. Here, a hollow porous carbon (HPC) nanocage with a controlled oxygen electronic state around designed carbon defects for CER activity is reported. Alkali etching can bring defects in zeolite with a hollow structure. In a hard template strategy, the type of carbon defects is directly related to etching degree of the zeolite template. More importantly, the oxygen atoms can be &#8220;borrowed&#8221; from the zeolite framework by the defective carbon. The electron density around unsaturated O atoms can be decreased on the minor defects in carbon compared with that on large defects which is favorable for the adsorption of Cl&#8722;. Consequently, the as&#8208;synthesized HPC nanocages with minor defects show excellent electrocatalytic performance for CER with a low overpotential of 94&#160;mV at current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with good stability, which is superior to the commercial precious metal catalyst of dimensionally stable anode (DSA), and the best in the reported carbon materials. The designed carbon materials provide an option for metal&#8208;free industrial catalysts with significant CER activities.

         <title>A Universal Microscopic Patterned Doping Method for Perovskite Enables Ultrafast, Self&#8208;Powered, Ultrasmall Perovskite Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscale patterned doping is difficult for perovskite&#160;due to its solubility to the photoresist. This problem is solved by utilizing the self&#8208;doping phenomenon of perovskite. This method is successfully realized by an ultrasmall (2 &#181;m) perovskite pn junction with satisfactory photodetector performance, which sheds light on fabricating integrated perovskite device arrays.








Abstract
Novel metal halide perovskite&#160;is proven to be a promising optoelectronic material. However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self&#8208;powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.

However, fabricating microscopic perovskite devices is still challenging because the perovskite is soluble with the photoresist, which conflicts with conventional microfabrication technology. The size of presently reported perovskite devices is about 50&#160;&#181;m. Limited by the large size of perovskite optoelectronic devices, they cannot be readily adopted in the fields of imaging, display, etc. Herein a universal microscopic patterned doping method is proposed, which can realize microscale perovskite devices. Rather than by the conventional doping method, in this study the local Fermi level of perovskite is modulated by the redistributing intrinsic ion defects via a polling voltage. A satisfactorily stable polarized ion distribution can be achieved by optimization of the perovskite material and polling voltage, resulting in ultrafast (40 &#181;s), self-powered microscale (2&#160;&#181;m) photodiodes. This work sheds light on a route to fabricate integrated perovskite optoelectronic chips.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Circadian Clock Regulation via Biomaterials for Nucleus Pulposus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus and improve disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8211;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid.








Abstract
Circadian clock disorder during tissue degeneration has been considered the potential pathogenesis for various chronic diseases, such as intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In this study, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials (ClockMPs) that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in IVDD and improve the physiological function of NPCs for disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8208;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid. In vitro experiments verified that ClockMPs can scavenge reactive oxygen species to maintain a stable microenvironment for the circadian clock by promoting the binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins. ClockMPs can regulate the expression of core circadian clock genes by activating the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway in NPCs to remodel the intrinsic circadian clock and promote extracellular matrix synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments of IVDD treated with ClockMPs proved that ClockMPs can promote disc regeneration by regulating the circadian clock of NPCs. In conclusion, ClockMPs provided a novel and promising strategy for circadian clock regulation during tissue regeneration.

         <title>Sequential Co&#8208;Passivation in InAs Colloidal Quantum Dot Solids Enables Efficient Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the passivation of III&#8208;V InAs quantum dots, this work designs a sequential co&#8208;passivation ligand exchange strategy involving Z&#8208;type, InBr3, and X&#8208;type methylammonium acetate. The application of sequential co&#8208;passivation dots to near&#8208;infrared photodetectors produces photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency of 37%, which is 20% better than the current best.








Abstract
III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for optoelectronic applications, for they avoid heavy metals while achieving absorption spanning the visible to the infrared (IR). However, the covalent nature of III&#8208;V CQDs requires the development of new passivation strategies to fabricate conductive CQD solids for optoelectronics: this work shows herein that ligand exchanges, previously developed in II&#8208;VI and IV&#8208;VI quantum dots and employing a single ligand, do not fully passivate CQDs, and that this curtails device efficiency. Guided by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, this work develops a co&#8208;passivation strategy to fabricate indium arsenide CQD photodetectors, an approach that employs the combination of X&#8208;type methyl ammonium acetate (MaAc) and Z&#8208;type ligands InBr3. This approach maintains charge carrier mobility and improves passivation, seen in a 25% decrease in Stokes shift, a fourfold reduction in the rate of first&#8208;exciton absorption linewidth broadening over time&#8208;under&#8208;stress, and leads to a doubling in photoluminescence (PL) lifetime. The resulting devices show 37% external quantum efficiency (EQE) at 950&#160;nm, the highest value reported for InAs CQD photodetectors.

         <title>Non&#8208;Toxic CuInS2/ZnS Colloidal Quantum Dots for Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of CuInS2/ZnS quantum dots (QDs) with a high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at 920 nm is reported. Notably, the synthesis employs a supplementary S precursor, hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS), which gives rise to better size homogeneity and an improvement in PLQE. Implementation of the QDs in a light&#8208;emitting device gives an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%.








Abstract
Ternary CuInS2 quantum dots (QDs) with photoluminescence that is tunable from the visible to the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region are promising light&#8208;emitters for consumer electronics due to the absence of toxic elements such as Pb, Cd, or As. Despite the compelling performance of visible&#8208;light&#8208;emitting CuInS2 QDs, reports on NIR emission remain limited, with modest efficiencies at wavelengths beyond 900&#160;nm. In this work, the facile synthesis of NIR&#8208;emitting CuInS2/ZnS QDs is reported. A combination of two&#160;sulfur precursors w as used in the synthesis, comprising 1&#8208;dodecanethiol (DDT) and hexamethyldisilathiane (HMDS). The reactive HMDS facilitates faster nucleation and leads to a higher density of emissive Cu&#8208;deficiency sites. The resulting QDs exhibit high photoluminescence quantum efficiency (PLQE) of 65% at a long emission wavelength of 920&#160;nm. Using these QDs, NIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) are fabricated, which attain an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.2%. This efficiency is comparable to the best reported PbS and InAs QD LEDs, and the emission wavelength exceeds that of lead iodide perovskites. This work thus marks one of the first reports of efficient NIR LEDs based on environmentally benign CuInS2 QDs and may open up promising new applications in consumer electronic products.

In&#8208;situ Activation of Snap&#8208;through Instability in Multi&#8208;response Metamaterials through Multistable Topological Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Snap&#8208;through instability has been widely leveraged in metamaterials to attain non&#8208;monotonic responses for a specific subset of applications where conventional monotonic materials fail to perform. In the remaining more plentiful set of ordinary applications, snap&#8208;through instability is harmful, and current snapping metamaterials become inadequate because their capacity to snap cannot be suppressed post&#8208;fabrication. Here, a class of topology&#8208;transformable metamaterials is introduced to enable in&#8208;situ activation and deactivation of the snapping capacity, providing a remarkable level of versatility in switching between responses from monotonic to monostable and bistable snap&#8208;through. Theoretical analysis, numerical simulations, and experiments are combined to unveil the role played by contact in the topological transformation capable of increasing the geometry incompatibility and confinement stiffness of selected architectural members. The strategy here presented for post&#8208;fabrication reprogrammability of matter and on&#8208;the&#8208;fly response switching paves the way to multifunctionality for application in multiple sectors from mechanical logic gates, and adjustable energy dissipators, to in&#8208;situ adaptable sport&#160;equipment.S1 S2S3S4S5S6S7S8

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are&#160;10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. We herein report the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT.&#160;By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor&#160;10B concentration of 8.8%ID/g or 102.1&#160;&#956;g/g at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response&#160;in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient&#160;10B accumulation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are&#160;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. We herein report the design and preparation of sub-10 nm&#160;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B-enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h-&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;BN-PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT.&#160;By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h-&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;BN-PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor&#160;&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;B concentration of 8.8%ID/g or 102.1&#160;&#956;g/g at 12&#160;h post-injection. Moreover, h-&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;BN-PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells.

         <title>The Construction of Microbial Synthesis System for Rare Earth Enrichment and Material Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rare earth materials play an irreplaceable role in biomedical and high technology fields. However, typical mining and extraction approaches of rare earth elements (REEs) often lead to severe environmental problems and resource wastage due to the involvement of hazardous chemicals. Although biomining showed elegant alternatives, there are still grand challenges to sustainably isolate and recover REEs in nature because of insufficient metal&#8208;extracting microbes and RE&#8208;scavenging macromolecular tools. To obtain high&#8208;performance rare earth materials directly from rare earth ore, new generation of biological synthesis strategies need to be developed for efficient preparation of REEs. The microbial synthesis system established here has achieved active biomanufacturing of high&#8208;purity rare earth products. Further, through employing robust affinity columns bioconjugated with structurally engineered proteins, we acquired outstanding separation of Eu/Lu and Dy/La with purity of 99.9% (Eu), 97.1% (La) and 92.7% (Dy). More importantly, in situ one&#8208;pot synthesis of lanthanide&#8208;dependent methanol dehydrogenase was well harnessed and exclusively adsorbed La, Ce, Pr, and Nd in RE tailing for advanced biocatalysis, indicating high value&#8208;added application. Therefore, our novel biosynthetic platform provides an insightful roadmap to expand the scope of chassis engineering in terms of biofoundry and to manufacture valuable bioproducts related to REEs.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency Enabled by a 2D&#8208;Conjugated Non&#8208;fullerene Acceptor Featuring Favorable Electronic and Aggregation Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy to design new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;16, the &#960;&#8208;expanded phenazine&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing Voc, Jsc, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based ternary devices fabricated via a two&#8208;in&#8208;one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.

         <title>Boosting the Photoluminescence Efficiency of InAs Nanocrystals Synthesized with Aminoarsine via a ZnSe Thick&#8208;shell Overgrowth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
InAs&#8208;based nanocrystals can enable RoHS&#8208;compliant optoelectronic devices, but their photoluminescence efficiency needs improvement for practical applications. We report an optimized synthesis of InAs@ZnSe core@shell nanocrystals that allows to finely tune the ZnSe shell thickness up to 7 mono&#8208;layers (MLs) and to boost the emission, reaching a quantum yield of &#8764;70% at &#8764;900&#160;nm. We demonstrate that a high quantum yield can be attained when the shell thickness is at least &#8764;3ML. Notably, the photoluminescence lifetime (58&#160;ns) does not vary much as a function of the shell thickness, whereas the Auger recombination time (a limiting aspect in technological applications when fast) slows down from 11&#160;ps to 38&#160;ps when increasing the shell thickness from 1.5 to 7MLs. Chemical and structural analyses evidence that InAs@ZnSe nanocrystals do not exhibit any strain at the core&#8208;shell interface, likely due to the formation of an In&#8208;Zn&#8208;Se interlayer. Such interpretation is supported by atomistic modelling, which indicates the interlayer as being composed of In, Zn, Se and cation vacancies, alike to the In2ZnSe4 crystal structure. The simulations reveal an electronic structure consistent with that of type&#8208;I heterostructures, in which localized trap states can be passivated by a thick shell (&gt;3ML) and excitons are confined in the core.

         <title>Mechanistic computational modeling of implantable, bioresorbable, drug release systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable, bioresorbable drug delivery systems offer an alternative to current drug administration techniques; allowing for patient&#8208;tailored drug dosage, while also increasing patient compliance. Mechanistic mathematical modeling allows for the acceleration of the design of the release systems, and for prediction of physical anomalies that are not intuitive and might otherwise elude discovery. This study investigates short&#8208;term drug release as a function of water&#8208;mediated polymer phase inversion into a solid depot within hours to days, as well as long&#8208;term hydrolysis&#8208;mediated degradation and erosion of the implant over the next few weeks. Finite difference methods were used to model spatial and temporal changes in polymer phase inversion, solidification, and hydrolysis. Modeling revealed the impact of non&#8208;uniform drug distribution, production and transport of H+ ions, and localized polymer degradation on the diffusion of water, drug, and hydrolyzed polymer byproducts. Compared to experimental data, the computational model accurately predicted the drug release during the solidification of implants over days and drug release profiles over weeks from microspheres and implants. This work offers new insight into the impact of various parameters on drug release profiles, and is a new tool to accelerate the design process for release systems to meet a patient specific clinical need.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Stalactite Nanopores for Biosensing and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nature provides a wide range of self&#8208;assembled structures from the nanoscale to the macroscale. Under the right thermodynamic conditions and with the appropriate material supply, structures like stalactites, icicles, and corals can grow. However, the natural growth process is time&#8208;consuming. This work demonstrates a fast, nature&#8208;inspired method for growing stalactite nanopores using heterogeneous atomic deposition of hafnium dioxide at the orifice of templated silicon nitride apertures. Our stalactite nanostructures combine the benefits of reduced sensing region typically for 2D material nanopores with the asymmetric geometry of capillaries, resulting in ionic selectivity, stability, and scalability. The proposed growing method provides an adaptable nanopore platform for basic and applied nanofluidic research, including biosensing, energy science, and filtration technologies.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Hydrogel Electrolyte for All&#8208;Flexible Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Hydrogel electrolytes have been widely explored in Zn metal batteries for application in wearable electronics. While extensive studies have been conducted in optimizing the chemical structure and boosting the tensile elasticity, the mechanical stability of the hydrogel under repeated deformation is largely overlooked, leading to unsatisfactory performance at large cycling capacity. We systematically analyze the compressive fatigue&#8208;resistance properties of the hydrogel electrolyte, revealing the critical roles of the salts and copolymer matrix on crack initiation and propagation. We show that, on the premise of homogeneous Zn deposition, an improved anti&#8208;fatigue property is essential to achieve high&#8208;capacity Zn metal anodes. The optimal Zn(ClO4)2&#8208;polyacrylamide/chitosan hydrogel electrolyte (C&#8208;PAMCS) exhibits an unprecedented lifespan of 1500&#160;h for Zn//Zn cells at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2. We exemplify the potential application of C&#8208;PAMCS in all&#8208;flexible Zn&#8208;ion batteries enabled by a flexible current collector based on Ag nanowires embedded elastomer. This work provides the rationale under hydrogel electrolyte engineering for developing high&#8208;performance Zn anodes and derived energy storage devices.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tuned Fano Resonances in All&#8208;Dielectric Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Si/Ge0.90Sn0.10 core/shell metasurface is developed to harness Fano resonance in the short&#8208;wave infrared spectral range. This resonance exploits the efficient coupling between the electric and magnetic dipoles, which is modulated with the incident light polarization. A refractive&#8208;index nanosensor is fabricated to detect a change of 10&#8722;2 unit with a sensitivity of 386 nm/RIU, despite the low quality factor.








Abstract
The short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) is an underexploited portion of the electromagnetic spectrum in metasurface&#8208;based nanophotonics despite its strategic importance in sensing and imaging applications. This is mainly attributed to the lack of material systems to tailor light&#8211;matter interactions in this range. Herein, this limitation is addressed and an all&#8208;dielectric silicon&#8208;integrated metasurface enabling polarization&#8208;induced Fano resonance control at SWIR frequencies is demonstrated. The platform consists of a 2D Si/Ge0.9Sn0.1 core/shell nanowire array on a silicon wafer. By tuning the light polarization, it is shown that the metasurface reflectance can be efficiently engineered due to Fano resonances emerging from the electric and magnetic dipoles competition. The interference of optically induced dipoles in high&#8208;index nanowire arrays offers additional degrees of freedom to tailor the directional scattering and the flow of light while enabling sharp polarization&#8208;modulated resonances. This tunablity is harnessed in nanosensors yielding an efficient detection of 10&#8722;2 changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium.

         <title>Antisense Oligonucleotides Selectively Enter Human&#8208;Derived Antibiotic&#8208;Resistant Bacteria through Bacterial&#8208;Specific ATP&#8208;Binding Cassette Sugar Transporter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To overcome the challenge that the current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize antisense oligonucleotides by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers, allowing specific and efficient destruction of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria.









Abstract
Current vehicles used to deliver antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) cannot distinguish between bacterial and mammalian cells, greatly hindering the preclinical or clinical treatment of bacterial infections, especially those caused by antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Herein, bacteria&#8208;specific ATP&#8208;binding cassette (ABC) sugar transporters are leveraged to selectively internalize ASOs by hitchhiking them on &#945; (1&#8211;4)&#8208;glucosidically linked glucose polymers. Compared with their cell&#8208;penetrating peptide counterparts, which are non&#8208;specifically engulfed by mammalian and bacterial cells, the presented therapeutics consisting of glucose polymer and antisense peptide nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;modified nanoparticles are selectively internalized into the human&#8208;derived multidrug&#8208;resistant Escherichia coli and methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, and they display a much higher uptake rate (i.e., 51.6%). The developed strategy allows specific and efficient killing of nearly 100% of the antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria. Its significant curative efficacy against bacterial keratitis and endophthalmitis is also shown. This strategy will expand the focus of antisense technology to include bacterial cells other than mammalian cells.

         <title>Microfluidic Templated Stem Cell Spheroid Microneedles for&#160;Diabetic Wound Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle patch fabricated with an advanced microfluidic template approach is presented. The microneedle platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Wound dressing patches based on stem cells have demonstrated promising potential in the treatment of diabetic wounds, while their capabilities in the maintenance of cell stemness, effective exchange of cellular substance, and precise targeting of the stem cells remain to be promoted. Here, a novel stem cell spheroid loaded microneedle (MN@SPs) patch is presented using microfluidic templating technology. By leveraging the precise fluid manipulation capabilities of the microfluidic template, stem cell spheroids (SPs) with uniform size can be generated in situ. The resulting SPs exhibit advanced viability and cell functions, as evidenced by the overexpressed genes related to extracellular matrix organization and angiogenesis. By loading these SPs into the microneedles (MNs), the platform enables the precise delivery and exchange of multiple active substances, which contribute to advanced neovascularization, collagen deposition, and tissue reconstruction of diabetic wounds. Overall, this microfluidic&#8208;engineered stem cell therapy platform demonstrates significant promise in promoting wound healing.

         <title>Fluoride&#8208;Catalyzed Siloxane Exchange as a Robust Dynamic Chemistry for High&#8208;Performance Vitrimers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through reactive extrusion of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent processability. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers.








Abstract
Sustainable development of new technologies requires materials having advanced physical and chemical properties while maintaining reprocessability and recyclability. Vitrimers are designed for this purpose; however, their dynamic covalent chemistries often have drawbacks or are limited to specialized polymers. Here, fluoride&#8208;catalyzed siloxane exchange is reported as an exceptionally robust chemistry for scalable production of high&#8208;performance vitrimers through industrial processing of commodity polymers such as poly(methyl methacrylate), polyethylene, and polypropylene. The vitrimers show improved resistance to creep, heat, oxidation, and hydrolysis, while maintaining excellent melt flow for processing and recycling. Furthermore, the siloxane exchange between different vitrimers during mechanical blending results in self&#8208;compatibilized blends without any compatibilizers. This offers a general, scalable method for producing sustainable high&#8208;performance vitrimers and a new strategy for recycling mixed plastic wastes.

         <title>Excimer&#8208;Mediated Ultrafast Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay Enables Giant Photothermal Performance for Optimized Phototheranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the competitive superiority of intermolecular nonradiative decay over the conventional intramolecular nonradiative decay in developing high&#8208;performance organic photothermal materials. Rational manipulation of intermolecular nonradiative decay through simple aggregation control enables an ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% to realize highly efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo.








Abstract
Developing organic photothermal materials (OPMs) with high photothermal performance for phototheranostic mainly focus on the manipulation of intramolecular nonradiative (intraNR) decay, which often requires quite complicated and time&#8208;consuming molecular engineering. In addition to intraNR decay, intermolecular nonradiative (interNR) decay is equally important and more convenient in governing photothermal performance. However, controlling interNR decay remains challenging due to the limited understanding of their origin and dynamics. Here, systemic investigation of intraNR and interNR decay directs the first demonstration of simple manipulation of interNR decay to produce a giant photothermal performance for optimized phototheranostic. Among three designed polymers with varying fluorine substitution, structure&#8211;performance studies reveal a dimer&#8208;initiated interNR decay to improve photothermal performance. Dimer is formed by intermolecular C&#63743;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bond. This finding inspires a simple aggregation control strategy to form excited dimer, namely, excimer. It initiates an &#8776;100&#8208;fold enhancement in interNR decay rate over conventional intraNR decay to produce ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% for efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo. This study provides insights into interNR decay in achieving a giant photothermal effect and paves a convenient way to develop high&#8208;performance OPMs.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wide&#8208;bandgap polymer poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the acceptor layer of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer organic solar cells (OSCs). Besides enhancing molecular stacking, PVK n&#8208;dopes the electron acceptor, increases the electron concentration, and improves charge transport, leading to elevated power conversion efficiency in OSCs, especially for the D18/L8&#8208;BO active layer which demonstrates device efficiency over 19% with PVK addition.








Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed organic solar cells (OSCs) are conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor&#8211;acceptor (D/A) interfaces, and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. In this work, a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) is added to the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration, and improve charge transport. Such n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. Therefore, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases when 2.50 wt.% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer of commonly&#8208;used high&#8208;efficiency system and a maximum value of 19.05% can be achieved. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so the results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Rationalized Electroepitaxy toward Scalable Single&#8208;Crystal Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Scalable Zn electroepitaxy is realized on the mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil by reasonably circumventing interface distorted alloying and electroosmosis of the second kind, harvesting ultrahigh reversibility of Zn anodes.








Abstract
Electroepitaxy is recognized as an effective approach to prepare metal electrodes with nearly complete reversibility. Nevertheless, large&#8208;scale manipulation is still not attainable owing to complicated interfacial chemistry. Here, the feasibility of extending Zn electroepitaxy toward the bulk phase over a mass&#8208;produced mono&#8208;oriented Cu(111) foil is demonstrated. Interfacial Cu&#8211;Zn alloy and turbulent electroosmosis are circumvented by adopting a potentiostatic electrodeposition protocol. The as&#8208;prepared Zn single&#8208;crystalline anode enables stable cycling of symmetric cells at a stringent current density of 50.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled full cell further sustaines a capacity retention of 95.7% at 5.0 A g&#8722;1 for 1500 cycles, accompanied by a controllably low N/P ratio of 7.5. In addition to Zn, Ni electroepitaxy can be realized by using the same approach. This study may inspire rational exploration of the design of high&#8208;end metal electrodes.

         <title>Li&#8208;Ion Transfer Mechanism of Gel Polymer Electrolyte with Sole Fluoroethylene Carbonate Solvent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gel polymer electrolyte is in situ solidified with fluoroethylene carbonate and ester monomers to investigate the Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism. Therein, an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer between the solvent and the polymer matrix is formed. With lower ion&#8208;diffusion barrier, the electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; is expected as a novel ion&#8208;transfer path, facilitating Li&#8208;ion migration.








Abstract
Although gel polymer electrolytes (GPEs) represent a promising candidate to address the individual limitations of liquid and solid electrolytes, their extensive development is still hindered due to the veiled Li&#8208;ion conduction mechanism. Herein, the related mechanism in GPEs is extensively studied by developing an in situ polymerized GPE comprising fluoroethylene carbonate (FEC) solvent and carbonate ester segments (F&#8208;GPE). Practically, although with high dielectric constant, FEC fails to effectively transport Li ions when acting as the sole solvent. By sharp contrast, F&#8208;GPE demonstrates superior electrochemical performances, and the related Li&#8208;ion transfer mechanism is investigated using molecular dynamics simulations and 7Li/6Li solid&#8208;state nNMR spectroscopy. The polymer segments are extended with the swelling of FEC, then an electron&#8208;delocalization interface layer is generated between abundant electron&#8208;rich groups of FEC and the polymer ingredients, which works as an electron&#8208;rich &#8220;Milky Way&#8221; and facilitates the rapid transfer of Li ions by lowering the diffusion barrier dramatically, resulting in a high conductivity of 2.47&#160;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a small polarization of about 20&#160;mV for Li//Li symmetric cell after 8000&#160;h. Remarkably, FEC provides high flame&#8208;retardancy and makes F&#8208;GPE remains stable under ignition and puncture tests.

         <title>Crystallinity and Phase Control in Formamidinium&#8208;Based Dion&#8211;Jacobson 2D Perovskite via Seed&#8208;Induced Growth for Efficient Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites based on Formamidinium (FA) hold the potential for excellent stability and a broad absorption range, making them attractive materials for solar cells. However, FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites produced via one&#8208;step processing exhibit poor crystallinity and random quasi&#8208;quantum wells (QWs), leading to subpar photovoltaic performance. In this study, we introduce a seed&#8208;induced growth approach employing MAPbCl3 and BDAPbI4 in the deposition of FA&#8208;based Dion&#8208;Jacobson 2D perovskite films. This method yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films as the seeds preferentially precipitate and serve as templates for the epitaxial growth of FA&#8208;based counterparts, effectively suppressing the &#948; phase. Moreover, the epitaxial growth facilitated by uniformly dispersed seeds results in simultaneous crystallization from top to bottom, efficiently mitigating random phases (n = 2, 3, 4&#8230;) induced by the diffusion of organic cations and, in turn, minimizing energy loss. We systematically investigate the impact of seed&#8208;induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA&#8208;based 2D perovskites. As a result, the optimized FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 hours of storage.

We systematically investigate the impact of seed-induced growth on the crystallization and phase distribution of FA-based 2D perovskites. As a result, the optimized FA-based 2D perovskite solar cell delivers an outstanding efficiency of 20.0%, accompanied by a remarkable fill factor of 0.823. Additionally, the unencapsulated device demonstrates exceptional stability, maintaining 98% of its initial efficiency after 1344 hours of storage.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Efficiency over Linear Assemblies of Copper&#8208;Cobalt Nanophases Stabilized by Redox Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered NO3&#8722; reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a net&#8208;zero carbon route to the realization of high NH3 productivity. However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half&#8208;cell EE commonly &lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO3&#8722; binding affinity and sluggish NO3RR kinetics. To alleviate this, we suggest a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub&#8208;20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons. Our theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu&#8208;Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO3&#8722; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to NH3, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu&#8208;Co sites at sub&#8208;5&#160;nm distance. In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative NO2. As a result, we achieve a stable NO3RR with a current density of &#8764;450&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% for the formation of NH3, and an unprecedented half&#8208;cell EE of &#8764;42%.

         <title>Evidence for anisotropic superconductivity beyond Pauli limit in infinite&#8208;layer lanthanum nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
After being expected as a promising analogue to cuprates for decades, superconductivity was&#160;recently discovered in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates, providing new opportunities to explore mechanisms of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. However, in sharp contrast to the single&#8208;band and anisotropic superconductivity in cuprates, nickelates exhibit a multi&#8208;band electronic structure and an unexpected isotropic superconductivity as reported recently, which challenges the cuprate&#8208;like picture in nickelates. Here, we show strong anisotropic magnetotransport behaviors in La&#8208;based nickelate films with enhanced crystallinity and superconductivity (Tconset$T_c^{onset}$ = 18.8 K, Tczero$T_c^{zero}$ = 16.5 K). The upper critical fields are anisotropic and violate the estimated BCS Pauli limit ( HPauli,&#956;=1&#956;B=1.86&#215;Tc,H=0${H}_{Pauli,\mu \ = \ 1{\mu }_B} = \ 1.86 \times {T}_{c,H\ = \ 0}$) for in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Moreover, the anisotropic superconductivity has been further manifested by the cusp&#8208;like peak of the angle&#8208;dependent Tc and the vortex motion anisotropy under external magnetic fields.

         <title>Surface Restructuring of Zeolite&#8208;Encapsulated Halide Perovskite to Activate Lattice Oxygen Oxidation for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites possess great potential for electrochemical water splitting that has not been realized due to their intolerance to water. Here, methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) are used to electrocatalyze water oxidation in aqueous electrolytes by creating MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 host&#8208;guest composites. Due to the protective feature of the zeolite matrix, halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolites achieve an excellent stability in water. The resultant electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring during oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the formation of an edge&#8208;sharing &#945;&#8208;PbO2 active layer. The existence of charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the MAPbX3/&#945;&#8208;PbO2 interface significantly modulates the surface electron density of the &#945;&#8208;PbO2 and optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate species. Furthermore, the soft&#8208;lattice nature of halide perovskites enables more facile triggering of lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of nanostructured &#945;&#8208;PbO2, exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent OER activity and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer for MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite. As a result, the developed MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite manifests an ultralow overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;M KOH. Our findings offer facile access to halide perovskite applied to water electrolysis with enhanced intrinsic activity, providing a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Materials for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal is a state of matter being intermediate between solid and liquid. Liquid crystal materials exhibit both orientational order and fluidity. Whilst liquid crystals have long been highly recognized in the display industry, in recent decades, liquid crystals provide new opportunities into the cross&#8208;field of material science and biomedicine due to its biocompatibility, multifunctionality, and responsiveness. In this review, we summarize the latest achievements of liquid crystal materials applied in biomedical fields. We start by introducing the basic concepts of liquid crystals, and then shift to the components of liquid crystals as well as functional materials derived therefrom. After that, we discuss the ongoing and foreseeable applications of liquid crystal materials in the biomedical field with emphasis put on several cutting&#8208;edge aspects, including drug delivery, bioimaging, tissue engineering, implantable devices, biosensing, and wearable devices. We hope this review will stimulate ingenious ideas for the future generation of liquid crystal&#8208;based drug development, artificial implants, disease diagnosis, health status monitoring, and beyond.

         <title>Type I Photosensitization with Strong Hydroxyl Radical Generation in NIR Dye Boosted by Vigorous Intramolecular Motions for Synergistic Therapy</title>

Abstract
Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment. On the other hand, it is challenging to obtain an efficient solid&#8208;state intramolecular motion to promote the development of molecular machine and molecular motor. However, the relationship between them has never been revealed. In this work, we develop a pyrazine&#8208;based near&#8208;infrared type I PS with remarkable donor&#8208;acceptor effect. Notably, the intramolecular motions have almost been maximized by the combination of intramolecular and intermolecular engineering to simultaneously introduce the unlimited bond stretching vibration and boost the group rotation. The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%. The D&#8208;A conformation of PS can also induce a very small singlet&#8208;triplet splitting of 0.07&#160;eV, which is crucial to promote the intersystem crossing for the triplet sensitization. Interestingly, its photosensitization is closely related to the intramolecular motions, and a vigorous motion may give rise to a strong &#183;OH generation. In view of its excellent photosensitization and photothermal behavior, the biocompatible PS exhibits a superior imaging&#8208;guided cancer synergistic therapy. This work stimulates the development of advanced PS for the biomedical application and solid&#8208;state intramolecular motions.

&lt;p&gt;Development of type I photosensitizers (PSs) with strong hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) formation is particularly important in the anaerobic tumor treatment.

The photothermal conversion caused by the intramolecular motions is realized with efficiency as high as 86.8%.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad potential for use in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites may be more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains were successfully designed and synthetized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT in a physiological environment. Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs were achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It was found that intracellular active substances (DNA and protein), not membranes, were more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enabled CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility, which was further proven in extended in vitro and in vivo aPDT experiments. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Photofunctional Scope of Fluorescent Dithienylethene Conjugates with Aza&#8208;Heteroaromatic Cations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dithienylethenes are structurally integrated with heteroaromatic cations. The photoswitches in their ring&#8208;open forms show fluorescence in the visible spectral range, while the ring&#8208;closed isomers are non&#8208;fluorescent. This leads to ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching with the emission output being fine&#8208;tuned by the conjugation degree of the heteroaromatic units.








Abstract
A series of dithienylethene (DTE) photoswitches with aza&#8208;heteroaromatic cationic moieties is synthesized. The switches are characterized regarding their photochemical and photophysical properties in acetonitrile and in water. The efficiency of the switching and the photostationary state composition depend on the degree of &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic systems. Thus, DTEs with acridinium&#8208;derived moieties have very low quantum yields for the ring&#8208;closing process, which is in contrast to switches with pyridinium and quinolinium moieties. All switches emit fluorescence in their open forms. The involved electronic transitions are traced back to an integrative picture including the DTE core and the cationic arms. The emission can be fine&#8208;tuned by the &#960;&#8208;conjugation of the heteroaromatic cations, reaching the red spectral region for DTEs with acridinium moieties. On ring&#8208;closing of the DTEs the fluorescence is not observable anymore. Theoretical calculations point to rather low&#8208;lying energy levels of the highly conjugated ring&#8208;closed DTEs, which would originate near&#8208;infrared emission (&gt; 1200&#160;nm). The latter is predicted to be very weak due to the concurrent non&#8208;radiative deactivation, according to the energy&#8208;gap law. In essence, an ON&#8211;OFF fluorescence switching as the result of the electrocyclic ring&#8208;closing reaction is observed.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Light Accelerated Prodrug Reduction of Pt(IV)&#8208;Incorporating Pseudo Semiconducting Polymers for Robust Degradation and Maximized Photothermal/Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

NIR&#8208;II light accelerated prodrug reduction of Pt(IV) nanoparticles is studied&#160;by co&#8208;assembling a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer with Oxa(IV) in the polymer main chain for NIR&#8208;II light phototriggered effective photothermal therapy and synergistic photoactivated chemo&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Selective activation of Pt(IV) prodrugs within tumors is particularly attractive because of their low damage to normal tissues. However, current common activation via chemical/photoreduction of Pt(IV) prodrugs into Pt(II) counterparts is limited by undesirable spatial&#8211;temporal control over this reduction process and the ineffective tissue penetration depth of undesirable light. Here, a pseudo&#8208;conjugated&#8208;polymer is designed via Stille polymerization, resulting in PSP&#8208;Pt with a Pt(IV) prodrug of oxaliplatin (Oxa(IV)) in the polymer main chain that can be activated by NIR&#8208;II light. PSP&#8208;Pt can co&#8208;assemble with a commercially available lipid polymer, namely mPEG2k&#8208;DSPE, into NPPSP&#8208;Pt. Under 1064&#160;nm light irradiation, NPPSP&#8208;Pt can be photoactivated to accelerate the Pt(IV) reduction to release oxaliplatin, thereby killing the cancer cells by photothermal effect and chemo&#8208;immunotherapy inside a mouse model with CT26 colon cancer. This work reports the application of NIR&#8208;II light for accelerating Pt(IV) reduction for cancer tumor therapy.

         <title>Mechanical Signal&#8208;Tailored Hydrogel Microspheres Recruit and Train Stem Cells for Precise Differentiation</title>

Abstract
The aberrant mechanical microenvironment in degenerated tissues induces misdirection of cell fate, making it challenging to achieve efficient endogenous regeneration. Herein, a hydrogel microsphere&#8208;based synthetic niche with integrated cell recruitment and targeted cell differentiation properties via mechanotransduction was constructed for enhanced endogenous regeneration. Through the incorporation of microfluidics and photo&#8208;polymerization strategies, we prepared fibronectin (Fn) modified methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) microspheres with the independently tunable elastic modulus(1&#8208;10Kpa) and ECM ligand density (2 and 10&#160;&#956;g/ml), allowing a wide range of cytoskeleton modulation to trigger the corresponding mechanobiological signaling to direct cell fate. The combination of the soft matrix (2Kpa) and low ligand density (2&#160;&#956;g/ml) could support the nucleus pulposus (NP)&#8208;like differentiation of intervertebral disc (IVD) progenitor/stem cells by translocating Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP), without the addition of inducible biochemical factors. Meanwhile, platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB was loaded onto Fn&#8208;GelMA microspheres (PDGF@Fn&#8208;GelMA) via the heparin&#8208;binding domain of Fn and exhibited continuous release for over 28 days to initiate endogenous cell recruitment. In in vivo experiments, hydrogel microsphere&#8208;niche maintained the IVD structure and stimulated ECM synthesis, thereby enhancing the endogenous regeneration of NP. Overall, this synthetic niche with cell recruiting and mechanical training capabilities offered a promising novel strategy for endogenous tissue regeneration.

         <title>Flexible Transparent Electrodes Formed from Template&#8208;Patterned Thin&#8208;Film Silver</title>

Abstract
We report template&#8208;patterned, flexible Transparent Electrodes (TEs) formed from an ultrathin silver film on top of a commercial optical adhesive &#8211; Norland Optical Adhesive 63 (NOA63). NOA63 is shown to be an effective base&#8208;layer for ultrathin silver films that advantageously prevents coalescence of vapour&#8208;deposited silver atoms into large, isolated islands (Volmer&#8208;Weber growth), and so aids the formation of ultrasmooth continuous films. 12&#8208;nm silver films on top of free&#8208;standing NOA63 combine high, haze&#8208;free visible&#8208;light transparency (T &#8776; 60% at 550&#160;nm) with low sheet&#8208;resistance (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$ &#8776; 16 &#937;/sq.), and exhibit excellent resilience to bending, making them attractive candidates for flexible TEs. Etching the NOA63 base&#8208;layer with an oxygen plasma before silver deposition causes the silver to laterally segregate into isolated pillars, resulting in a much higher sheet resistance than silver grown on pristine NOA63 (Rs${\mathcal{R}}_s$&#160;&gt;&#160;8&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;&#937;/sq.). Hence, by selectively etching NOA63 before metal deposition, insulating regions may be defined within an otherwise conducting silver film, resulting in a differentially conductive film that can serve as a patterned TE for flexible devices. Transmittance may be increased (to 79% at 550&#160;nm) by depositing an antireflective layer of Al2O3 on the Ag layer at the cost of reduced flexibility.

         <title>Lubricated Interfaces Enabling Simultaneous Pulsatile and Continuous Chemical Release Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The release of chemicals following either pulsatile or continuous release modes is important for various potential applications, including programmed chemical reactions, mechanical actuation and treatments of various diseases. However, the simultaneous application of both modes in a single material system has been challenging. Here, we report two chemical loading methods in a liquid crystal&#8208;infused porous surface (LCIPS) which enables both a pulsatile and continuous release of chemicals simultaneously. Specifically, chemicals loaded in the porous substrate exhibit a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase&#8208;dependent continuous release, whereas the chemicals dissolved in micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets dispersed in the LC surface follow a pulsatile release activated by a phase transition. Moreover, we can control the loading method of distinct molecules to program their release mode. Finally, we demonstrate the pulsatile and continuous release of two distinct bioactive small molecules, tetracycline and dexamethasone, which display antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities for applications such as chronic wound healing and biomedical implant coating.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;narrow&#8208;bandwidth deep&#8208;red electroluminescence based on green plant&#8208;derived carbon dots</title>

Abstract
Deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (DR&#8208;LEDs, &gt;660&#160;nm) with high color&#8208;purity and narrow&#8208;bandwidth emission are promising for full&#8208;color displays and solid&#8208;state lighting applications. Currently, the DR&#8208;LEDs are mainly based on conventional emitters such as organic materials and heavy&#8208;metal based quantum dots (QDs) and perovskites. However, the organic materials always suffer from the complicated synthesis, inferior color purity with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) more than&#8201;40&#8201;nm and the QDs and perovskites still suffer from serious problems related to toxicity. Herein, we report the synthesis of efficient and high color&#8208;purity deep&#8208;red carbon dots (CDs) with a record narrow FWHM of 21&#160;nm and a high quantum yield of more than 50% from readily available green plants. Moreover, an exciplex host is further established using a polymer and small molecular blend, which has been shown to be an efficient strategy for producing high color&#8208;purity monochrome emission from deep&#8208;red CDs via F&#246;rster energy transfer. The deep&#8208;red CD&#8208;LEDs displays high color&#8208;purity with Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.692, 0.307). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of high color&#8208;purity CD&#8208;LEDs in the deep&#8208;red region, opening the door for the application of CDs in the development of high&#8208;resolution light&#8208;emitting display technologies.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics were rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endowed it with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibited catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroyed the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LaCoO3 nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Optical fibres embedded with as&#8208;grown carbon nanotubes for ultrahigh nonlinear optical responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photonic crystal fibre (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors.[1] Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibres by ex&#8208;situ transfer method, however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage.[2] Here, we&#160;report the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapour deposition method. A two&#8208;step growth method was&#160;developed to control the narrow diametre distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNTs embedded fibre, third&#8208;harmonic generation has been enhanced by &#8764;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. We&#160;further demonstrated a dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fibre mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8764;1561&#160;nm and &#8764;1064&#160;nm) by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diametre CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap PCF (HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8764; 0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8764; 1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fibre laser showed stable output of &#8764;10&#160;mW, &#8764;800 fs pulse width and &#8764;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. Our&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>Multifunctional Magnetic Oxide&#8208;MoS2 Heterostructures on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si&#8208;based platforms, is challenging. Here we demonstrate van der Waals heterostructures of La0.7Sr0.3MnO3 (LSMO), a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS2 on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force&#8208;mediated transfer were used to fabricate the LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures exhibit a gate&#8208;tunable rectifying behaviour, based on which metal&#8208;semiconductor field&#8208;effect transistors (MESFETs) with on&#8208;off ratios of over 104 can be achieved. The LSMO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open&#8208;circuit voltages and photocurrents.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Correlated oxides and related heterostructures are intriguing for developing future multifunctional devices by exploiting their exotic properties, but their integration with other materials, especially on Si-based platforms, is challenging. Here we demonstrate van der Waals heterostructures of La&lt;sub&gt;0.7&lt;/sub&gt;Sr&lt;sub&gt;0.3&lt;/sub&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (LSMO), a correlated manganite perovskite, and MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on Si substrates with multiple functions. To overcome the problems due to the incompatible growth process, technologies involving freestanding LSMO membranes and van der Waals force-mediated transfer were used to fabricate the LSMO-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures. The LSMO-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures exhibit a gate-tunable rectifying behaviour, based on which metal-semiconductor field-effect transistors (MESFETs) with on-off ratios of over 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; can be achieved. The LSMO-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures can function as photodiodes displaying considerable open-circuit voltages and photocurrents. In addition, the colossal magnetoresistance of LSMO endows the LSMO-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructures with an electrically tunable magnetoresponse at room temperature. Our work not only proves the applicability of the LSMO-MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure devices on Si-based platform but also demonstrates a paradigm to create multifunctional heterostructures from materials with disparate properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tenascin&#8208;C activation of lung fibroblasts in a 3D synthetic lung extracellular matrix mimic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lung extracellular matrix (ECM) maintains the structural integrity of the tissue and regulates the phenotype and functions of resident fibroblasts. Lung&#8208;metastatic breast cancer alters these cell&#8208;ECM interactions, promoting fibroblast activation. There is a need for bio&#8208;instructive ECM models that contain the ECM composition and biomechanics of the lung to study these cell&#8208;matrix interactions in vitro. Here, we developed a synthetic, bioactive hydrogel that mimics the native lung modulus and includes a representative distribution of the most abundant ECM peptide motifs responsible for integrin binding and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)&#8208;mediated degradation in the lung, which enables quiescent culture of human lung fibroblasts (HLFs). Stimulation with transforming growth factor &#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1), metastatic breast cancer conditioned media (CM), or tenascin&#8208;C&#8208;derived integrin&#8208;binding peptide activated hydrogel&#8208;encapsulated HLFs, demonstrating multiple environmental methods to activate HLFs in a lung ECM mimicking hydrogel. We propose this lung hydrogel platform as a tunable, synthetic approach to studying the independent and combinatorial effects of ECM in regulating fibroblast quiescence and activation.

         <title>Multifunctional additive CdAc2 for efficient perovskite&#8208;based solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite films fabricated on flexible and textured substrates often are highly defective, leading to poor performance of perovskite devices. Finding substrate&#8208;tolerant perovskite fabrication strategies is therefore paramount. Herein, we show that adding a small amount of Cadmium Acetate (CdAc2) in the PbI2 precursor solution results in nano&#8208;hole array films and improves the diffusion of organic salts in PbI2, and promotes favorable crystal orientation and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Polycrystalline perovskite films on the flexible substrate with ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetimes exceeding 6 &#956;s are achieved. Eventually, a PCE of 22.78% is obtained for single&#8208;junction flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). Furthermore, we find the strategy is also applicable for textured tandem solar cells. A champion PCE of 29.25% (0.5003 cm2) was demonstrated for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) with CdAc2. Moreover, the un&#8208;encapsulated TSCs maintains 109.78% of its initial efficiency after 300 hours operational at 45&#160;&#176;C in N2 atmosphere. Our work provides a facile strategy for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>A Programmable Actuator as Synthetic Earthworm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Natural earthworm with ability of loosening soils that favors sustainable agriculture has inspired a worldwide interests in the design of intelligent actuators. Given the inability to carry heavy loads and uncontrolled deformation, the vast majority of actuators can only perform simple tasks by bending, contraction, or elongation. Herein, we present a degradable actuator with ability of deforming in desired ways, which successfully mimics the burrowing activities of earthworms to loosen soils with increased soil porosity by digging, grabbing, and lifting the soil when it receives rains. Such a scarifying actuator is made of degradable cellulose acetate and uncrosslinked polyacrylamideviaswelling&#8208;photopolymerizing method. The water absorption of polyacrylamidein moisture conditions causes a rapid and remarkable bending. Such a mechanical bending can be controlled in specific areas of the cellulose acetate film if polyacrylamide is polymerized in a patterned way, so as to generate complicated deformations of the whole cellulose acetate. Patterning polyacrylamide within cellulose acetate is achieved based on reversible surface protection by means of pen writing, rather than the traditional masking techniques.The water&#8208;induced deformation of programmable cellulose&#8208;based actuators is well preserved in soil, which is appropriate for promoting the rain diffusion as well as the root breath.

         <title>Lipid Deposition Profiles Influence Foreign Body Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices, and factors that affect it are still being discovered. Here, it is demonstrated through Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS), RNA sequencing, and other biological analyses that the surface chemistry of an implant guides lipid deposition, which in turn affects the fibrotic response by influencing the reactions of immune cells to the material.








Abstract
Fibrosis remains a significant cause of failure in implanted biomedical devices and early absorption of proteins on implant surfaces has been shown to be a key instigating factor. However, lipids can also regulate immune activity and their presence may also contribute to biomaterial&#8208;induced foreign body responses (FBR) and fibrosis. Here it is demonstrated that the surface presentation of lipids on implant affects FBR by influencing reactions of immune cells to materials as well as their resultant inflammatory/suppressive polarization. Time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (ToF&#8208;SIMS) is employed to characterize lipid deposition on implants that are surface&#8208;modified chemically with immunomodulatory small molecules. Multiple immunosuppressive phospholipids (phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin) are all found to deposit preferentially on implants with anti&#8208;FBR surface modifications in mice. Significantly, a set of 11 fatty acids is enriched on unmodified implanted devices that failed in both mice and humans, highlighting relevance across species. Phospholipid deposition is also found to upregulate the transcription of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes in murine macrophages, while fatty acid deposition stimulated the expression of pro&#8208;inflammatory genes. These results provide further insights into how to improve the design of biomaterials and medical devices to mitigate biomaterial material&#8208;induced FBR and fibrosis.

         <title>Role of Magnetic Defects in Tuning Ground States of Magnetic Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements reveal the formation of linear Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn antiferromagnetic dimers in Mn&#8208;doped Sb2Te3, following the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori superexchange rule. Although the system is magnetically dilute, the experiments identify ferromagnetic dimers and correlations in the interblock across the van der Waals gap. These interactions explain the role of defects in tuning ground&#8208;states in magnetic topological insulators.








Abstract
Magnetic defects play an important, but poorly understood, role in magnetic topological insulators (TIs). For example, topological surface transport and bulk magnetic properties are controlled by magnetic defects in Bi2Se3&#8208;based dilute ferromagnetic (FM) TIs and MnBi2Te4 (MBT)&#8208;based antiferromagnetic (AFM) TIs. Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, the inelastic neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb2Te3 form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange coupling occurs via Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common interactions in the two materials classes. It is also found that the FM correlations in (Sb1&#8722;xMnx)2Te3 are likely driven by magnetic defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition to providing answers to long&#8208;standing questions about the evolution of FM order in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic order from AFM to FM in Sb&#8208;substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering of the intrablock and interblock&#160;coupling.

Despite its nascent ferromagnetism, the inelastic neutron scattering data show that a fraction of the Mn defects in Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; form strong AFM dimer singlets within a quintuple block. The AFM superexchange coupling occurs via Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn linear bonds and is identical to the AFM coupling between antisite defects and the FM Mn layer in MBT, establishing common interactions in the two materials classes. It is also found that the FM correlations in (Sb&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are likely driven by magnetic defects in adjacent quintuple blocks across the van der Waals gap. In addition to providing answers to long-standing questions about the evolution of FM order in dilute TI, these results also show that the evolution of global magnetic order from AFM to FM in Sb-substituted MBT is controlled by defect engineering of the intrablock and interblock&#160;coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual Behavior Regulation: Tether&#8208;Free Deep&#8208;Brain Stimulation by Photothermal and Upconversion Hybrid Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents for optogenetics. They can modulate neuronal activities via near&#8208;infrared laser&#8208;irradiated photostimulation (at 980&#160;nm) and thermo&#8208;stimulation (at 808&#160;nm) to realize in vitro neuron control and in vivo modulation of feeding behavior.








Abstract
Optogenetics has been plagued by invasive brain implants and thermal effects during photo&#8208;modulation. Here, two upconversion hybrid nanoparticles modified with photothermal agents, named PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G, which can modulate neuronal activities via photostimulation and thermo&#8208;stimulation under near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation at 980&#160;nm and 808&#160;nm, respectively, are demonstrated. PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G emits visible light (410&#8211;500&#160;nm or 500&#8211;570&#160;nm) through the upconversion process at 980&#160;nm, while they exhibit efficient photothermal effect at 808&#160;nm with no visible emission and tissue damage. Intriguingly, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B significantly activates extracellular sodium currents in neuro2a cells expressing light&#8208;gated channelrhodopsin&#8208;2 (ChR2) ion channels under 980&#8208;nm irradiation, and inhibits potassium currents in human embryonic kidney 293 cells expressing the voltage&#8208;gated potassium channels (KCNQ1) under 808&#8208;nm irradiation in vitro. Furthermore, deep&#8208;brain bidirectional modulation of feeding behavior is achieved under tether&#8208;free 980 or 808&#8208;nm illumination (0.8&#160;W cm&#8722;2) in mice stereotactically injected with PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B in the ChR2&#8208;expressing lateral hypothalamus region. Thus, PT&#8208;UCNP&#8208;B/G creates new possibility of utilizing both light and heat to modulate neural activities and provides a viable strategy to overcome the limits of optogenetics.

         <title>An Engineered Nanosugar Enables Rapid and Sustained Glucose&#8208;Responsive Insulin Delivery in Diabetic Mice</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanosugar platform is engineered to attain glucose&#8208;responsive and sustained release of insulin. The biodegradable platform enables rapid and extended glucose control&#160;in type 1 diabetes mouse models, upon a single subcutaneous injection. The architecture and morphology of the nanocomplexes are tailored to control the&#160;bioavailability, and pharmacokinetics of insulin&#160;through the direct blood capillaries absorption and the lymphatic&#160;trafficking.








Abstract
Glucose&#8208;responsive insulin&#8208;delivery platforms that are sensitive to dynamic glucose concentration fluctuations and provide both rapid and prolonged insulin release have great potential to control hyperglycemia and avoid hypoglycemia diabetes. Here, biodegradable and charge&#8208;switchable phytoglycogen nanoparticles capable of glucose&#8208;stimulated insulin release are engineered. The nanoparticles are &#8220;nanosugars&#8221; bearing glucose&#8208;sensitive phenylboronic acid groups and amine moieties that allow effective complexation with insulin (&#8776;95% loading capacity) to form nanocomplexes. A single subcutaneous injection of nanocomplexes shows a rapid and efficient response to a glucose challenge in two distinct diabetic mouse models, resulting in optimal blood glucose levels (below 200&#160;mg dL&#8211;1) for up to 13&#160;h. The morphology of the nanocomplexes is found to be key to controlling rapid and extended glucose&#8208;regulated insulin delivery in vivo. These studies reveal that the injected nanocomplexes enabled efficient insulin release in the mouse, with optimal bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and safety profiles. These results highlight a promising strategy for the development of a glucose&#8208;responsive insulin delivery system based on a natural and biodegradable nanosugar.

         <title>Complex Structures Made Simple &#8211; Continuous Flow Production of Core Cross&#8208;Linked Polymeric Micelles for Paclitaxel Pro&#8208;Drug&#8208;Delivery</title>

The synthesis of multifunctional nanoparticles is commonly a complex endeavor and hampers the clinical translation of effective nanomedicines. The work presents a microfluidic setup based on reactive polypept(o)ides and a combination of slit interdigital micromixers and tangential flow filtration for the continuous production of drug&#8208;loaded corecross&#8208;linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a single precisely controlled process.








Abstract
Translating innovative nanomaterials to medical products requires efficient manufacturing techniques that enable large&#8208;scale high&#8208;throughput synthesis with high reproducibility. Drug carriers in medicine embrace a complex subset of tasks calling for multifunctionality. Here, the synthesisof pro&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded core cross&#8208;linked polymeric micelles (CCPMs) in a continuous flow processis reported, which combines the commonly separated steps of micelle formation, core cross&#8208;linking, functionalization, and purification into a single process. Redox&#8208;responsive CCPMs are formed from thiol&#8208;reactive polypept(o)ides of polysarcosine&#8208;block&#8208;poly(S&#8208;ethylsulfonyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine) and functional cross&#8208;linkers based on dihydrolipoic acid hydrazide for pH&#8208;dependent release of paclitaxel. The precisely controlled microfluidic process allows the production of spherical micelles (Dh&#160;= 35&#160;nm) with low polydispersity values (PDI &lt; 0.1) while avoiding toxic organic solvents and additives with unfavorable safety profiles. Self&#8208;assembly and cross&#8208;linking via slit interdigital micromixers produces 350&#8211;700&#160;mg of CCPMs/h per single system, while purification by online tangential flow filtration successfully removes impurities (unimer &#8804; 0.5%). The formed paclitaxel&#8208;loaded CCPMs possess the desired pH&#8208;responsive release profile, display stable drug encapsulation, an improved toxicity profile compared to Abraxane (a trademark of Bristol&#8208;Myers Squibb), and therapeutic efficiency in the B16F1&#8208;xenotransplanted zebrafish model. The combination of reactive polymers, functional cross&#8208;linkers, and microfluidics enables the continuous&#8208;flow synthesis of therapeutically active CCPMs in a single process.

         <title>Distinct Contact Scaling Effects in MoS2 Transistors Revealed with Asymmetrical Contact Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are demonstrated to explore scaling effects in Ni&#8211;MoS2&#160;contacts. ACMs compare electron injection at different contact lengths on the same MoS2&#160;channel to eliminate channel&#8208;to&#8208;channel variations. Importantly, source contacts yield more degradation in transistor current when scaled than drain contacts. ACMs provide a framework for generating new understanding of 2D&#8208;metal interfaces.








Abstract
2D semiconducting materials have immense potential for future electronics due to their atomically thin nature, which&#160;enables better scalability. While the channel scalability of 2D materials has been extensively studied, the current understanding of contact scaling in 2D devices is inconsistent and&#160;oversimplified. Here physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are combined to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D field&#8208;effect transistors. The ACMs directly compare electron injection at different contact lengths while using the exact same MoS2&#160;channel, eliminating channel&#8208;to&#8208;channel variations.&#160;The&#160;results show that scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain contacts do not. Compared to devices with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts) exhibit larger variations, 15% lower drain currents at high drain&#8211;source voltages, and a higher chance of&#160;early saturation and negative differential resistance. Quantum transport simulations reveal that the transfer length of Ni&#8211;MoS2&#160;contacts can be as short as 5&#160;nm. Furthermore,&#160;it is&#160;clearly identified that the actual transfer length depends on the quality of the metal&#8208;2D interface. The ACMs demonstrated here will enable further understanding of contact scaling behavior at various interfaces.

ACMs compare electron injection at different contact lengths on the same MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;channel to eliminate channel-to-channel variations. Importantly, source contacts yield more degradation in transistor current when scaled than drain contacts. ACMs provide a framework for generating new understanding of 2D-metal interfaces.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconducting materials have immense potential for future electronics due to their atomically thin nature, which&#160;enables better scalability. While the channel scalability of 2D materials has been extensively studied, the current understanding of contact scaling in 2D devices is inconsistent and&#160;oversimplified. Here physically scaled contacts and asymmetrical contact measurements (ACMs) are combined to investigate the contact scaling behavior in 2D field-effect transistors. The ACMs directly compare electron injection at different contact lengths while using the exact same MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;channel, eliminating channel-to-channel variations.&#160;The&#160;results show that scaled source contacts can limit the drain current, whereas scaled drain contacts do not. Compared to devices with long contact lengths, devices with short contact lengths (scaled contacts) exhibit larger variations, 15% lower drain currents at high drain&#8211;source voltages, and a higher chance of&#160;early saturation and negative differential resistance. Quantum transport simulations reveal that the transfer length of Ni&#8211;MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;contacts can be as short as 5&#160;nm. Furthermore,&#160;it is&#160;clearly identified that the actual transfer length depends on the quality of the metal-2D interface. The ACMs demonstrated here will enable further understanding of contact scaling behavior at various interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Gradient Bouligand Structure Enhances Impact Resistance of Ceramic&#8208;Polymer Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Translating different biostructural elements into a single synthetic material represents a promising pathway to achieve improved mechanical properties. Here, one new&#8208;style biomimetic structure is designed by coupling gradient structure with Bouligand structure, resulting in a ceramic&#8208;polymer composite with synergistically enhanced impact resistance. This work highlights the importance of hierarchical structural design for future impact&#8208;resistant structural materials.








Abstract
Biological materials relied on multiple synergistic structural design elements typically exhibit excellent comprehensive mechanical properties. Hierarchical incorporation of different biostructural elements into a single artificial material is a promising approach to enhance mechanical properties, but remains challenging. Herein, a biomimetic structural design strategy is proposed by coupling gradient structure with twisted plywood Bouligand structure, attempting to improve the impact resistance of ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Via robocasting and sintering, kaolin ceramic filaments reinforced by coaxially aligned alumina nanoplatelets are arranged into Bouligand structure with a gradual transition in filament spacing along the thickness direction. After the following polymer infiltration, biomimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer composites with a gradient Bouligand (GB) structure are eventually fabricated. Experimental investigations reveal that the incorporation of gradient structure into Bouligand structure improves both the peak force and total energy absorption of the obtained ceramic&#8208;polymer composites. Computational modeling further suggests the substantial improvement in impact resistance by adopting GB structure, and clarifies the underlying deformation behavior of the biomimetic GB structured composites under impact. This biomimetic design strategy may provide valuable insights for developing lightweight and impact&#8208;resistant structural materials in the future.

A rough endoplasmic reticuluminspired superhigh&#8208;sulfur&#8208;content cathode is successfully fabricated with a unique topological structure at the molecularlevel to realize a Li&#8211;S cell with high mass and capacity loading, which not only demonstrates a sophisticated biomimetic design model but also connects the two disparate fields of biology and electrochemical energy storage.








The development of highly sophisticated biomimetic models is significant yet remains challenging in the electrochemical energy storage field. Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) cells with high sulfur content and high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathodes are urgently required to meet the fast&#8208;growing demand for electronic devices. Nevertheless, such cathode materials generally suffer from large sulfur agglomeration, nonporous structure, and insufficient conductivity, leading to rapid capacity decay and low sulfur utilization. Herein, inspired by rough endoplasmic reticulum, a 2D polystyrene (PS)&#8208;brush&#8208;based (G&#8208;g&#8208;PS) superhigh&#8208;sulfur&#8208;content (96 wt%) composite(G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S) is fabricated via the vulcanization reaction. The vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains and their S8 composites on the nanosheet surface can efficiently provide sulfur species, and the intersheet interstitial pores can provide rapid mass&#8208;transfer channels for redox reactions of sulfur species. Furthermore, the highly sulfophilic vulcanized PS side&#8208;chains are able to effectively inhibit the shuttle effect of polysulfides and regulate their redox process. With these merits, the cells with G&#8208;g&#8208;sPS@S cathodes exhibit an ultralow decay rate of 0.02% per cycle over 400 cycles at 2 C and deliver a superior areal capacity of 12.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 even with a high sulfur loading of 10.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2.

Li&#8208;mediated photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (PEC NRR) provides a solar&#8208;powered green and sustainable route for ammonia synthesis. The ammonia production rate and efficiency of the process is fundamentally limited by the formation and decomposition/hydrogenation of Li3N but can be effectively enhanced by controlling the reaction conditions, including the N2 pressure, the proton sources, and introduction of oxidizing gases.








Abstract
As a widely used commodity chemical, ammonia is critical for producing nitrogen&#8208;containing fertilizers and serving as the promising zero&#8208;carbon energy carrier. Photoelectrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (PEC NRR) can provide a solar&#8208;powered green and sustainable route for synthesis of ammonia (NH3). Herein, an optimum PEC system is reported with an Si&#8208;based hierarchically&#8208;structured PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode and well&#8208;thought&#8208;out trifluoroethanol as the proton source for lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR, achieving a record high NH3 yield of 43.09&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 and an excellent faradaic efficiency of 46.15% under 0.12 MPa O2 and 3.88 MPa N2 at 0.07&#160;V versus lithium(0/+) redox couple (vs Li0/+). PEC measurements coupled with operando characterization reveal that the PdCu/TiO2/Si photocathode under N2 pressures facilitate the reduction of N2 to form lithium nitride (Li3N), which reacts with active protons to produce NH3 while releasing the Li+ to reinitiate the cycle of the PEC NRR. The Li&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process is further enhanced by introducing small amount of O2 or CO2 under pressure by accelerating the decomposition of Li3N. For the first time, this work provides mechanistic understanding of the lithium&#8208;mediated PEC NRR process and opens new avenues for efficient solar&#8208;powered green conversion of N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3.

         <title>Controlled Isotropic Canalization of Microsized Silicon Enabling Stable High&#8208;Rate and High&#8208;Loading Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled isotropic canalization is developed as a markedly distinct hierarchical strategy for microsized silicon, enabling stable cycling at high rates and industrial&#8208;scale loadings, attributable to configurational isotropy facilitating rapid ion transport in all directions of individual granules as well as controlled consolidation at a medium interfacial bonding density fostering selective ion permeation.








Abstract
Silicon is attractive for lithium&#8208;ion batteries and beyond but suffers large volume change upon cycling. Hierarchical tactics show promise yet lack control over the unit construction and arrangement, limiting stability improvement at the practical level. Here, a protocol is developed as controlled isotropic canalization of microsized silicon. Distinct from the existing strategies, it involves isotropic canalization by honeycomb&#8208;like radial arrangement of silicon nanosheets, and canal consolidation by controlled dual bonding of silicon with carbon. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon dual&#8208;bonded silicon honeycomb&#8208;like microparticles, specifically with a medium density of C&#63743;N&#63743;Si and C&#63743;O&#63743;Si bonds, exhibit stable cycling impressively at high rates and industrial&#8208;scale loadings. Two key issues involve isotropic canalization facilitating ion transport in all directions of individual granules and controlled consolidation conferring selective ion permeation and securing charge transport. The study highlights the configurational isotropy and interfacial bonding density, and provides insight into rational design and manufacture of silicon and others with industry&#8208;viable features.

Distinct from the existing strategies, it involves isotropic canalization by honeycomb-like radial arrangement of silicon nanosheets, and canal consolidation by controlled dual bonding of silicon with carbon. The proof-of-concept nitrogen-doped carbon dual-bonded silicon honeycomb-like microparticles, specifically with a medium density of C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;N&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Si and C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;Si bonds, exhibit stable cycling impressively at high rates and industrial-scale loadings. Two key issues involve isotropic canalization facilitating ion transport in all directions of individual granules and controlled consolidation conferring selective ion permeation and securing charge transport. The study highlights the configurational isotropy and interfacial bonding density, and provides insight into rational design and manufacture of silicon and others with industry-viable features.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antisolvent&#8208;Assisted In Situ Cation Exchange of Perovskite Quantum Dots for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent&#8208;assisted in situ cation exchange of perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) is demonstrated. The vacancy&#8208;mediated cation diffusion can efficiently passivate the surface defects of PQDs without affecting the size distribution and surface ligand chemistry of PQDs. Meanwhile, using the antisolvent&#8208;assisted cation exchange method, the PQD solid with a flattened energy landscape, improved stacking orientation, and favorable charge carrier transport is realized.








Abstract
Cesium&#8208;formamidinium lead iodide perovskite quantum dots (FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 PQDs) show high potential for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics due to their outstanding optoelectronic properties. However, achieving composition&#8208;tunable hybrid PQDs with desirable charge transport remains a significant challenge. Herein, by leveraging an antisolvent&#8208;assisted in situ cation exchange of PQDs, homogeneous FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 PQDs with controllable stoichiometries and surface ligand chemistry are realized. Meanwhile, the crystallographic stability of PQDs is substantially improved by substituting the cations of the PQDs mediated by surface vacancies. Consequently, PQD solar cell delivers an efficiency of 17.29%, the highest value among the homostructured PQD solar cells. The high photovoltaic performance is attributed to the broadened light harvesting spectra, flattened energy landscape, and rationalized energy levels of highly oriented PQD solids, leading to efficient charge carrier extraction. This work provides a feasible approach for the stoichiometry regulation of PQDs to finely tailor the optoelectronic properties and tolerance factors of PQDs toward high&#8208;performing photovoltaics.

         <title>Open&#8208;Shell Diradical&#8208;Sensitized Electron Transport Layer for High&#8208;Performance Colloidal Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new passivation strategy is proposed to improve the optoelectronic properties of the zinc oxide (ZnO) electron&#8208;transport layer by incorporating stable organic open&#8208;shell donor&#8208;acceptor type diradicaloids. The passivation efficiency is found related to the electronic push&#8208;pull effect of the diradicaloids, which can be designed by tailoring the terminal donor segments.








Abstract
The zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NPs) are well&#8208;documented as an excellent electron transport layer (ETL) in optoelectronic devices. However, the intrinsic surface flaw of the ZnO NPs can easily result in serious surface recombination of carriers. Exploring effective passivation methods of ZnO NPs is essential to maximize the device's performance. Herein, a hybrid strategy is explored for the first time to improve the quality of ZnO ETL by incorporating stable organic open&#8208;shell donor&#8208;acceptor type diradicaloids. The high electron&#8208;donating feature of the diradical molecules can efficiently passivate the deep&#8208;level trap states and improve the conductivity of ZnO NP film. The unique advantage of the radical strategy is that its passivation effectiveness is highly correlated with the electron&#8208;donating ability of radical molecules, which can be precisely controlled by the rational design of molecular chemical structures. The well&#8208;passivated ZnO ETL is applied in lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dot solar cells, delivering a power conversion efficiency of 13.54%. More importantly, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, this work will inspire the exploration of general strategies using radical molecules to construct high&#8208;efficiency solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Piezoresistive Free&#8208;standing Microfiber Strain Sensor for High&#8208;resolution Battery Thickness Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a straightforward approach, a freestanding and conformable piezoresistive microfiber based on conductive microspheres is developed for lithium&#8208;ion battery deformation detection. Employing microspheres provides high&#8208;resolution strain sensitivity and fast response. The microfiber developed in this work is capable to detect 1 &#181;m deformation in addition to high durability against overload strain.








Abstract
Highly sensitive microfiber strain sensors are promising for the detection of mechanical deformations in applications where limited space is available. In particular for in situ battery thickness monitoring where high resolution and low detection limit are key requirements. Herein, the realization of a highly sensitive strain sensor for in situ lithium&#8208;ion (Li&#8208;ion) battery thickness monitoring is presented. The compliant fiber&#8208;shaped sensor is fabricated by an upscalable wet&#8208;spinning method employing a composite of microspherical core&#8208;shell conductive particles embedded in an elastomer. The electrical resistance of the sensor changes under applied strain, exhibiting a high strain sensitivity and extremely low strain detection limit of 0.00005 with high durability of 10&#8201;000 cycles. To demonstrate the accuracy and ease of applicability of this sensor, the real&#8208;time thickness change of a Li&#8208;ion battery pouch cell is monitored during the charge and discharge cycles. This work introduces a promising approach with the least material complexity for soft microfiber strain gauges.

         <title>Realizing Photoswitchable Mechanoluminescence in Organic Crystals Based on Photochromism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manipulation of mechanoluminescence in organic molecules has tremendous application potential in many fields. Here an example is successfully developed to realize photoswitchable mechanoluminescence byendowing reversible photochromic properties to organic mechanoluminescent molecule. It provides a suggestive molecular designing strategy to achieve novel smart luminescent materials toward widespread applications in material science fields.








Abstract
Organic mechanoluminescent (ML) materials possessing photophysical properties that are sensitive to multiple external stimuli have shown great potential in many fields, including optic and sensing. Particularly, the photoswitchable ML property for these materials is fundamental to their applications but remains a formidable challenge. Herein, photoswitchable ML is successfully realized by endowing reversible photochromic properties to an ML molecule, namely 2&#8208;(1,2,2&#8208;triphenylvinyl) fluoropyridine (o&#8208;TPF). o&#8208;TPF shows both high&#8208;contrast photochromism with a distinct color change from white to purplish red, as well as bright blue ML (&#955;ML&#160;= 453&#160;nm). The ML property can be repeatedly switched between ON and OFF states under alternate UV and visible light irradiation. Impressively, the photoswitchable ML is of high stability and repeatability. The ML can be reversibly switched on and off by conducting alternate UV and visible light irradiation in cycles under ambient conditions. Experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the change of dipole moment of o&#8208;TPF during the photochromic process is responsible for the photoswitchable ML. These results outline a fundamental strategy to achieve for the control of organic ML and pave the way to the development of expanded smart luminescent materials and their applications.

The thermodynamically stabilized LiF&amp;FeF3 coating can effectively suppress the nanoscale structural degradation and the intergranular cracks and alleviates the outward migration of O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&lt;2), increases oxygen vacancy formation energies, and accelerates interfacial Li+ diffusion.








Abstract
Pushing the limit of cutoff potentials allows nickel&#8208;rich layered oxides to provide greater energy density and specific capacity whereas reducing thermodynamic and kinetic stability. Herein, a one&#8208;step dual&#8208;modified method is proposed for in situ synthesizing thermodynamically stable LiF&amp;FeF3 coating on LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 surfaces by capturing lithium impurity on the surface to overcome the challenges suffered. The thermodynamically stabilized LiF&amp;FeF3 coating can effectively suppress the nanoscale structural degradation and the intergranular cracks. Meanwhile, the LiF&amp;FeF3 coating alleviates the outward migration of O&#945;&#8722; (&#945;&lt;2), increases oxygen vacancy formation energies, and accelerates interfacial Li+ diffusion. Benefited from these, the electrochemical performance of LiF&amp;FeF3 modified materials is improved (83.1% capacity retention after 1000 cycles at 1C), even under exertive operational conditions of elevated temperature (91.3% capacity retention after 150 cycles at 1C). This work demonstrates that the dual&#8208;modified strategy can simultaneously address the problems of interfacial instability and bulk structural degradation and represents significant progress in developing high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>Band Position&#8208;Independent Piezo&#8208;Electrocatalysis for Ultrahigh CO2 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities, drawing great interest but also suffering from the controversial mechanisms. A narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy is proposed by choosing CO2 reduction as a probe reaction to distinguish the two potential mechanisms, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, and reveal that piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band positions.








Abstract
Piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis as an emerging mechano&#8208;to&#8208;chemistry energy conversion technique opens multiple innovative opportunities and draws great interest over the past decade. However, the two potential mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis, i.e., screening charge effect and energy band theory, generally coexist in the most piezoelectrics, making the essential mechanism remain controversial. Here, for the first time, the two mechanisms in piezo&#8208;electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (PECRR) is distinguished through a narrow&#8208;bandgap piezo&#8208;electrocatalyst strategy using MoS2 nanoflakes as demo. With conduction band of &#8722;0.12&#160;eV, the MoS2 nanoflakes are unsatisfied for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO redox potential of &#8722;0.53&#160;eV, yet they achieve an ultrahigh CO yield of &#8776;543.1&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 in PECRR. Potential band position shifts under vibration are still unsatisfied with CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO potential verified by theoretical investigation and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic experiment, further indicating that the mechanism of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis is independent of band position. Besides, MoS2 nanoflakes exhibit unexpected intense &#8220;breathing&#8221; effect under vibration and enable the naked&#8208;eye&#8208;visible inhalation of CO2 gas, independently achieving the complete carbon cycle chain from CO2 capture to conversion. The CO2 inhalation and conversion processes in PECRR are revealed by a self&#8208;designed in situ reaction cell. This work brings new insights into the essential mechanism and surface reaction evolution of piezo&#8208;electrocatalysis.

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven CO2 reduction by water with a Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction affords an avenue to access energy storage and to alleviate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, yet the separation of charge carriers and the integrative regulation of water oxidation and CO2 activation sites remain challenging. Here, a BiVO4/g&#8208;C3N4 (BVO/CN) Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction as such a prototype is constructed by spatially separated dual sites with CoOx clusters and imidazolium ionic liquids (IL) toward CO2 photoreduction. The optimized CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL delivers an &#8776;80&#8208;fold CO production rate without H2 evolution compared with urea&#8208;C3N4 counterpart, together with nearly stoichiometric O2 gas produced. Experimental results and DFT calculations unveil the cascade Z&#8208;scheme charge transfer and subsequently the prominent redox co&#8208;catalysis by CoOx and IL for holes&#8208;H2O oxidation and electrons&#8208;CO2 reduction, respectively. Moreover, in situ &#181;s&#8208;transient absorption spectra clearly show the function of each cocatalyst and quantitatively reveal that the resulting CoOx&#8208;BVO/CN&#8208;IL reaches up to the electron transfer efficiency of 36.4% for CO2 reduction, far beyond those for BVO/CN (4.0%) and urea&#8208;CN (0.8%), underlining an exceptional synergy of dual reaction sites engineering. This work provides deep insights and guidelines for the rational design of highly efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with precise redox catalytic sites toward solar fuel production.

         <title>Nonepitaxial Electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;Textured Zn Anode on Textureless Substrates for Dendrite&#8208;Free and Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Suppressed Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured and compact Zn on textureless substrates is reported and ascribed to enhanced nonepitaxial nucleation and competitive advantageous lateral growth. The resulting freestanding (002)&#8208;textured Zn anode exhibits significantly suppressed hydrogen evolution and prolonged Zn plating&#8211;stripping cycling life.








Abstract
Nontoxic and safe aqueous Zn batteries are largely restricted by the detrimental dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution of Zn metal anode. The (002)&#8208;textured Zn electrodeposition, demonstrated as an effective approach for solving these issues, is nevertheless achieved mainly by epitaxial or hetero&#8208;epitaxial deposition of Zn on pre&#8208;textured substrates. Herein, the electrodeposition of (002)&#8208;textured and compact Zn on textureless substrates (commercial Zn, Cu, and Ti foils) at a medium&#8208;high galvanostatic current density is reported. According to the systematic investigations on Zn nucleation and growth behaviors, this is ascribed to two reasons: i) the promoted nonepitaxial nucleation of fine horizontal (002) nuclei at increased overpotential and ii) the competitive growth advantages of (002)&#8208;orientated nuclei. The resulting freestanding (002)&#8208;textured Zn film exhibits significantly suppressed hydrogen evolution and prolonged Zn plating&#8211;stripping cycling life, achieving over 2100 mAh cm&#8722;2 cumulative capacity under a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and a high depth of discharge (DOD) of 45.5%. Therefore, this study provides both fundamental and practical insights into long&#8208;life Zn metal batteries.

         <title>High Performance Transparent Silver Grid Electrodes for Organic Photovoltaics Fabricated by Selective Metal Condensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance silver grid electrodes on glass and plastic substrates fabricate by condensation coefficient modulation, using a perfluorinated polymer shown to be far superior to other compounds used for this purpose to date. The very narrow line width and small pitch open the door to using these electrodes in OPVs without a PEDOT: PSS layer to span the gaps between grid lines.








Abstract
Silver grid electrodes on glass and flexible plastic substrates with performance that exceeds that of commercial indium&#8208;tin oxide (ITO) coated glass are reported and show their suitability as a drop&#8208;in replacement for ITO glass in solution&#8208;processed organic photovoltaics (OPVs). When supported on flexible plastic substrates these electrodes are stable toward repeated bending through a small radius of curvature over tens of thousands of cycles. The grid electrodes are fabricated by the unconventional approach of condensation coefficient modulation using a perfluorinated polymer shown to be far superior to the other compounds used for this purpose to date. The very narrow line width and small grid pitch that can be achieved also open the door to the possibility of using grid electrodes in OPVs without a conducting poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT: PSS) layer to span the gaps between grid lines.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Like Conjugated Molecule as Hole&#8208;Selective Contact for Operationally Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photostable graphene&#8208;like conjugated molecule is developed as the hole&#8208;selective contact to improve the operational lifetime of inverted perovskite solar cells, enabling an estimated device operational lifetime of over 3000&#160;h.








Abstract
Further enhancing the operational lifetime of inverted&#8208;structure perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is crucial for their commercialization, and the design of hole&#8208;selective contacts at the illumination side plays a key role in operational stability. In this work, the self&#8208;anchoring benzo[rst]pentaphene (SA&#8208;BPP) is developed as a new type of hole&#8208;selective contact toward long&#8208;term operationally stable inverted PSCs. The SA&#8208;BPP molecule with a graphene&#8208;like conjugated structure shows a higher photostability and mobility than that of the frequently&#8208;used triphenylamine and carbazole&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective molecules. Besides, the anchoring groups of SA&#8208;BPP promote the formation of a large&#8208;scale uniform hole contact on ITO substrate and efficiently passivate the perovskite absorbers. Benefiting from these merits, the champion efficiencies of 22.03% for the small&#8208;sized cells and 17.08% for 5&#160;&#215;&#160;5&#160;cm2 solar modules on an aperture area of 22.4&#160;cm2 are achieved based on this SA&#8208;BPP contact. Also, the SA&#8208;BPP&#8208;based device exhibits promising operational stability, with an efficiency retention of 87.4% after 2000&#160;h continuous operation at the maximum power point under simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination, which indicates an estimated T80 lifetime of 3175&#160;h. This novel design concept of hole&#8208;selective contacts provides a promising strategy for further improving the PSC stability.

         <title>A Hierarchical Structured Fiber Device Remodeling the Acidic Tumor Microenvironment for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hierarchically structured fiber device is developed as a local drug delivery system for alleviating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). It has a great capacity to sustainably remodel the acidic TME, enhancing the antitumor immune response and finally improving the antitumor immunotherapy effect.








Abstract
The acidic microenvironment of tumors significantly reduces the anti&#8208;tumor effect of immunotherapy. Herein, a hierarchically structured fiber device is developed as a local drug delivery system for remodeling the acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) to improve the therapeutic effect of immunotherapy. Proton pump inhibitors in the fiber matrix can be sustainedly released to inhibit the efflux of intracellular H+ from tumor cells, resulting in the remodeling of the acidic TME. The targeted micelles and M1 macrophage membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles in internal cavities of fiber can induce immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells and phenotypic transformation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), respectively. The relief of the acidity in the TME further promotes ICD and the polarization of TAMs, alleviating the immunosuppressive microenvironment and synergistically enhancing the antitumor immune response. In vivo results reveal this local drug delivery system restores the pH value of TME from 6.8 to 7.2 and exhibit an excellent immunotherapeutic effect.

         <title>Topology Hierarchy of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides Built from Quantum Spin Hall Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel 2M&#8208;phase transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials are built from quantum spin Hall 1T'&#8208;TMD layers. A systematic investigation combining angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first&#8208;principles calculations reveals a topology hierarchy: 2M&#8208;WSe2, MoS2 and MoSe2 are weak topological insulators, whereas 2M&#8208;WS2 is a strong topological insulator. They can serve as parent compounds of various exotic phases and promise potentials in quantum electronics.








Abstract
The evolution of the physical properties of 2D material from monolayer limit to the bulk reveals unique consequences from dimension confinement and provides a distinct tuning knob for applications. Monolayer 1T'&#8208;phase transition metal dichalcogenides (1T'&#8208;TMDs) with ubiquitous quantum spin Hall (QSH) states are ideal 2D building blocks of various 3D topological phases. However, the stacking geometry has been previously limited to the bulk 1T'&#8208;WTe2 type. Here, the novel 2M&#8208;TMDs consisting of translationally stacked 1T'&#8208;monolayers are introduced as promising material platforms with tunable inverted bandgaps and interlayer coupling. By performing advanced polarization&#8208;dependent angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy as well as first&#8208;principles calculations on the electronic structure of 2M&#8208;TMDs, a topology hierarchy is revealed: 2M&#8208;WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2 are weak topological insulators (WTIs), whereas 2M&#8208;WS2 is a strong topological insulator (STI). Further demonstration of topological phase transitions by tunning interlayer distance indicates that band inversion amplitude and interlayer coupling jointly determine different topological states in 2M&#8208;TMDs. It is proposed that 2M&#8208;TMDs are parent compounds of various exotic phases including topological superconductors and promise great application potentials in quantum electronics due to their flexibility in patterning with 2D materials.

         <title>Intrinsic Anti&#8208;Freezing and Unique Phosphorescence of Glassy Hydrogels with Ultrahigh Stiffness and Toughness at Low Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular hydrogel with dense hydrogen&#8208;bond associations exhibits remarkable anti&#8208;freezing property, excellent mechanical performances, and unique phosphorescence at ultra&#8208;low temperatures. This gel maintains high transparency even in liquid nitrogen. The intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing property is related to that most water molecules within the gel are tightly bound and confined in the glassy matrix and become non&#8208;freezable.








Abstract
Most hydrogels become frozen at subzero temperatures, leading to degraded properties and limited applications.

&lt;p&gt;A supramolecular hydrogel with dense hydrogen-bond associations exhibits remarkable anti-freezing property, excellent mechanical performances, and unique phosphorescence at ultra-low temperatures. This gel maintains high transparency even in liquid nitrogen. The intrinsic anti-freezing property is related to that most water molecules within the gel are tightly bound and confined in the glassy matrix and become non-freezable.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most hydrogels become frozen at subzero temperatures, leading to degraded properties and limited applications. Cryoprotectants are massively employed to improve anti-freezing property of hydrogels; however, there are accompanied disadvantages, such as varied networks, reduced mechanical properties, and the risk of cryoprotectant leakage in aqueous conditions. Reported here is the glassy hydrogel having intrinsic anti-freezing capacity and excellent optical and mechanical properties at ultra-low temperatures. Supramolecular hydrogel of poly(acrylamide-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-methacrylic acid) with moderate water content (&#8776;50 wt.%) and dense hydrogen-bond associations is in a glassy state at room temperature. Since hydrogen bonds become strengthened as the temperature decreases, this gel becomes stronger and stiffer, yet still ductile, with Young's modulus of 900&#160;MPa, tensile strength of 30&#160;MPa, and breaking strain of 35% at &#8722;45&#160;&#176;C. This gel retains high transparency even in liquid nitrogen. It also exhibits unique phosphorescence due to presence of carbonyl clusters, which is further enhanced at subzero temperatures.

         <title>Engineering of Chain Rigidity and Hydrogen Bond Cross&#8208;Linking toward Ultra&#8208;Strong, Healable, Recyclable, and Water&#8208;Resistant Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>

Healable and recyclable elastomers with a super&#8208;high tensile strength of &#8776;142&#160;MPa and a remarkable toughness of &#8776;527&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;are fabricated by dynamically cross&#8208;linking copolymers composed of rigid polyimide and soft poly(urea&#8211;urethane) segments with hydrogen bonds. The elastomers can be conveniently healed and recycled to restore their original mechanical strength. Moreover, the elastomers exhibit excellent water and scratch resistance.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance elastomers have gained significant interest because of their wide applications in industry and&#160;our&#160;daily life. However, it remains a great challenge to fabricate elastomers simultaneously integrating ultra&#8208;high mechanical strength, toughness, and excellent healing and recycling capacities. In this study, ultra&#8208;strong, healable, and recyclable elastomers are fabricated by dynamically cross&#8208;linking copolymers composed of rigid polyimide (PI) segments and soft poly(urea&#8211;urethane) (PUU) segments with hydrogen bonds. The elastomers, which are denoted as PI&#63743;PUU, have a record&#8208;high tensile strength of &#8776;142&#160;MPa and an extremely high toughness of &#8776;527&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. The structure of the PI&#63743;PUU elastomer contains hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;cross&#8208;linked elastic matrix and homogenously dispersed rigid nanostructures. The rigid PI segments self&#8208;assemble to generate phase&#8208;separated nanostructures that serve as nanofillers to significantly strengthen the elastomers. Meanwhile, the elastic matrix is composed of soft PUU segments cross&#8208;linked with reversible hydrogen bonds, which largely enhance the strength and toughness of the elastomer. The dynamically cross&#8208;linked PI&#63743;PUU elastomers can be healed and recycled to restore their original mechanical strength. Moreover, because of the excellent mechanical performance and the hydrophobic PI segments, the PI&#63743;PUU elastomers are scratch&#8208;, puncture&#8208;, and water&#8208;resistant.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Industrial&#8208;Grade p&#8208;Type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 Thermoelectric Enabled by a Stepwise Optimization Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significantly suppressed lattice thermal conductivity &#954;ph and elevated quality factor B have created high&#8208;performance (Bi,Sb)2Te3 material. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample are enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200 g (industrial grade) with only &#8776;5% loss of thermoelectric (TE) performance, the resulting 17&#8208;couple TE modules exhibit an excellent conversion efficiency up to 6.3% (&#916;T&#160;= 245 K).








Abstract
As the sole dominator of the commercial thermoelectric (TE) market, Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys play an irreplaceable role in Peltier cooling and low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery. Herein, to improve the relative low TE efficiency determined by the figure of merit ZT, an effective approach is reported for improving the TE performance of p&#8208;type (Bi,Sb)2Te3 by incorporating Ag8GeTe6 and Se. Specifically, the diffused Ag and Ge atoms into the matrix conduce to optimized carrier concentration and enlarge the density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass while the Sb&#8208;rich nanoprecipitates generate coherent interfaces with little loss of carrier mobility. The subsequent Se dopants introduce multiple phonon scattering sources and significantly suppress the lattice thermal conductivity while maintaining a decent power factor. Consequently, a high peak ZT of 1.53 at 350 K and a remarkable average ZT of 1.31 (300&#8211;500 K) are attained in the Bi0.4Sb1.6Te0.95Se0.05&#160;+ 0.10 wt% Ag8GeTe6 sample. Most noteworthily, the size and mass of the optimal sample are enlarged to &#216;40 mm&#8208;200&#160;g and the constructed 17&#8208;couple TE module exhibits an extraordinary conversion efficiency of 6.3% at &#916;T&#160;= 245 K. This work demonstrates a facile method to develop high&#8208;performance and industrial&#8208;grade (Bi,Sb)2Te3&#8208;based alloys, which paves a strong way for further practical applications.

         <title>Oxyanion Engineering Suppressed Iron Segregation in Nickel&#8211;Iron Catalysts Toward Stable Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NO3&#8722; tailored FeOOH/Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 catalyst greatly alleviates Fe segregation via the chemical interaction of Fe and NO3&#8722;, exhibiting a considerably enhanced long&#8208;term stability with a six&#8208;fold improvement over FeOOH/Ni(OH)2 without NO3&#8722; modification.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron catalysts represent an appealing platform for electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline media because of their high adjustability in components and activity. However, their long&#8208;term stabilities under high current density still remain unsatisfactory due to undesirable Fe segregation. Herein, a nitrate ion (NO3&#8722;) tailored strategy is developed to mitigate Fe segregation, and thereby improve the OER stability of nickel&#8211;iron catalyst. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy combined with theoretical calculations indicate that introducing Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 with stable NO3&#8722; in the lattice is conducive to constructing the stable interface of FeOOH/Ni3(NO3)2(OH)4 via the strong interaction between Fe and incorporated NO3&#8722;. Time of flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and wavelet transformation analysis demonstrate that the NO3&#8722; tailored nickel&#8211;iron catalyst greatly alleviates Fe segregation, exhibiting a considerably enhanced long&#8208;term stability with a six&#8208;fold improvement over FeOOH/Ni(OH)2 without NO3&#8722; modification. This work represents a momentous step toward regulating Fe segregation for stabilizing the catalytic performances of nickel&#8211;iron catalysts.

         <title>Duplex Responsive Nanoplatform with Cascade Targeting for Atherosclerosis Photoacoustic Diagnosis and Multichannel Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PA/ASePSD is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and pH/ROS dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a &#8220;three&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; therapeutic strategy of combined multi&#8208;channel mediated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux and anti&#8208;inflammation. PA/ASePSD provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques and the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression.








Abstract
The culprits of atherosclerosis are endothelial damage, local disorders of lipid metabolism, and progressive inflammation. Early atherosclerosis is typically difficult to diagnose in time due to the lack of obvious symptoms, thus missing the best period of treatment. In this work, a &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer (PMeTPP&#8208;MBT) based on 3,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;methylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;2,5&#8208;bis(2&#8208;octyldodecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4(2H,5H)&#8208;dione is designed as a novel photoacoustic contrast agent. On this basis, an intelligent responsive theranostic nanoplatform (PA/ASePSD) combining astaxanthin and SS&#8208;31 peptide and loading with PMeTPP&#8208;MBT is developed. The high affinity between the dextran shell with the broken endothelial surface VCAM&#8208;1 and CD44 confers active targeting of PA/ASePSD to atherosclerotic lesions. High levels of ROS in the acidic plaque microenvironment act as an intelligent cascade switch to achieve controlled release of astaxanthin, SS&#8208;31 peptide, and PMeTPP&#8208;MBT for non&#8208;invasive photoacoustic diagnosis, as well as plaque inhibition mediated by anti&#8208;inflammation and multichannel regulation (including ABCA1, ABCG1, CD36, and LOX&#8208;1) of lipid metabolism. Both in vitro and in vivo evaluations confirm the impressive anti&#8208;atherosclerotic capability and the accurate photoacoustic diagnosis of PA/ASePSD nanoparticles, thus promising a candidate for early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis theranostics.

&lt;p&gt;The culprits of atherosclerosis are endothelial damage, local disorders of lipid metabolism, and progressive inflammation. Early atherosclerosis is typically difficult to diagnose in time due to the lack of obvious symptoms, thus missing the best period of treatment.

         <title>Non&#8208;equilibrium&#8208;Growing Aesthetic Ionic Skin for Fingertip&#8208;Like Strain&#8208;Undisturbed Tactile Sensation and Texture Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the fingertip's formation and modulus&#8208;contrast structure, an aesthetic ionic skin grew using a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process is reported. Ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables both strain&#8208;undisturbed dynamic pressure sensing and fine texture recognition. Such a design overcomes the long&#8208;term contradiction encountered by previous ionic skins between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy.








Abstract
Humans use periodically ridged fingertips to precisely perceive the characteristics of objects via ion&#8208;based fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive mechanotransduction. However, designing artificial ionic skins with fingertip&#8208;like tactile capabilities remains challenging because of the contradiction between structural compliance and pressure sensing accuracy (e.g., anti&#8208;interference from stretch and texture recognition). Inspired by the formation and modulus&#8208;contrast hierarchical structure of fingertips, an aesthetic ionic skin grown from a non&#8208;equilibrium Liesegang patterning process is introduced. This ionic skin with periodic stiff ridges embedded in a soft hydrogel matrix enables strain&#8208;undisturbed triboelectric dynamic pressure sensing as well as vibrotactile texture recognition. By coupling with another piezoresistive ionogel, an artificial tactile sensory system is further fabricated as a soft robotic skin to mimic the simultaneous fast&#8208; and slow&#8208;adaptive multimodal sensations of fingers in grasping actions. This approach may inspire the future design of high&#8208;performance ionic tactile sensors for intelligent applications in soft robotics and prosthetics.

         <title>Photosensitive Dielectric 2D Perovskite Based Photodetector for Dual Wavelength Demultiplexing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By employing the photosensitive dielectric property of 2D perovskite, this work provided a demonstration of a bi&#8208;functional photovoltaic detector. A normal response of 405&#8208;nm light and a spike response of long wavelength coexist in this device. The spike response is a result of the dielectric property of 2D perovskite and can be used for two&#8208;wavelength demultiplexing.








Abstract
Stacked 2D perovskites provide more possibilities for next generation photodetector with more new features. Compared with its excellent optoelectronic properties, the good dielectric performance of metal halide perovskite rarely comes into notice. Here, a bifunctional perovskite based photovoltaic detector capable of two wavelength demultiplexing is demonstrated. In the Black Phosphorus/Perovskite/MoS2 structured photodetector, the comprehensive utilization of the photosensitive and dielectric properties of 2D perovskite allows the device to work in different modes. The device shows normal continuous photoresponse under 405 nm, while it shows a transient spike response to visible light with longer wavelengths. The linear dynamic range, rise/decay time, and self&#8208;powered responsivity under 405&#160;nm can reach 100, 38 &#181;s/50 &#181;s, and 17.7&#160;mA W&#8208;1, respectively. It is demonstrated that the transient spike photocurrent with long wavelength exposure is related to the illumination intensity and can coexist with normal photoresponse. Two waveband&#8208;dependent&#160;signals can be identified and used to reflect more information simultaneously. This work provides a new strategy for multispectral detection and demultiplexing, which can be used to improve data transfer rates and encrypted communications. This work mode can inspire more multispectral photodetectors with different stacked 2D materials, especially to the optoelectronic application of the wide bandgap, high dielectric photosensitive materials.

         <title>Density of States Engineering of n&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polymers for High Charge Transport Performances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transport properties of conjugated polymers relate closely to their density of states (DOS) distributions. This work enables DOS engineering of conjugated polymer by using different processing solvents to improve three electronic parameters in one polymer system: electrical conductivity, power factor, and Hall mobility. It is suggested that DOS engineering is crucial for the refinement of conjugated polymers for different electrical performances.








Abstract
Charge transport of conjugated polymers in functional devices closely relates to their density of states (DOS) distributions. However, systemic DOS engineering for conjugated polymers is challenging due to the lack of&#160;modulated methods and the unclear relationship between DOS and electrical properties. Here, the DOS distribution of conjugated polymers is engineered to enhance their electrical performances. The DOS distributions of polymer films are&#160;tailored using three processing solvents with different Hansen solubility parameters. The highest n&#8208;type electrical conductivity (39 &#177; 3 S cm&#8722;1), the highest power factor (63 &#177; 11 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2), and the highest Hall mobility (0.14 &#177; 0.02 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) of the polymer (FBDPPV&#8208;OEG) are&#160;obtained in three films with three various DOS distributions, respectively. Through theoretical and experimental exploration, it is revealed that the carrier concentration and transport property of conjugated polymers can be efficiently controlled by DOS engineering, paving the way for rationally fabricating organic semiconductors.

         <title>CoTe2: A Quantum Critical Dirac Metal with Strong Spin Fluctuations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoTe2 crystallizes in an orthorhombic marcasite structure. Calculations and transport measurements show presence of multiple nodal Dirac lines extending through the Fermi surface. Magnetic properties reveal this compound to be close to ferromagnetism, suppressed by spin fluctuations. This compound harbors a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac topology.








Abstract
Quantum critical points separating weak ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases trigger many novel phenomena. Dynamical spin fluctuations not only suppress the long&#8208;range order, but can also lead to unusual transport and even superconductivity. Combining quantum criticality with topological electronic properties presents a rare and unique opportunity. Here, by means of ab initio calculations and magnetic, thermal, and transport measurements, it is&#160;shown that the orthorhombic CoTe2 is close to ferromagnetism, which appears suppressed by spin fluctuations.

&lt;p&gt;CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; crystallizes in an orthorhombic marcasite structure. Calculations and transport measurements show presence of multiple nodal Dirac lines extending through the Fermi surface. Magnetic properties reveal this compound to be close to ferromagnetism, suppressed by spin fluctuations. This compound harbors a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac topology.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantum critical points separating weak ferromagnetic and paramagnetic phases trigger many novel phenomena. Dynamical spin fluctuations not only suppress the long-range order, but can also lead to unusual transport and even superconductivity. Combining quantum criticality with topological electronic properties presents a rare and unique opportunity. Here, by means of ab initio calculations and magnetic, thermal, and transport measurements, it is&#160;shown that the orthorhombic CoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is close to ferromagnetism, which appears suppressed by spin fluctuations. Calculations and transport measurements reveal nodal Dirac lines, making it a rare combination of proximity to quantum criticality and Dirac&#160;topology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Asymmetric Coordination Induces Electron Localization at Ca Sites for Robust CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Improving electron localization around Ca single&#8208;atom sites promotes CO2 activation for CO2 electroreduction to CO. A strategy to localize electrons on Ca p&#8208;orbitals through O doping is reported. This results in the asymmetric coordination (N and O) of the atomic Ca sites. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate the favorable *COOH formation under this asymmetric coordination strategy.








Abstract
Main group single atom catalysts (SACs) are promising for CO2 electroreduction to CO by virtue of their ability in preventing the hydrogen evolution reaction and CO poisoning. Unfortunately, their delocalized orbitals reduce the CO2 activation to *COOH. Herein, an O doping strategy to localize electrons on p&#8208;orbitals through asymmetric coordination of Ca SAC sites (Ca&#8208;N3O) is developed, thus enhancing the CO2 activation. Theoretical calculations indicate that asymmetric coordination of Ca&#8208;N3O improves electron&#8208;localization around Ca sites and thus promotes *COOH formation. X&#8208;ray absorption fine spectroscopy shows the obtained Ca&#8208;N3O features: one O and three N coordinated atoms with one Ca as a reactive site. In situ attenuated total reflection infrared spectroscopy proves that Ca&#8208;N3O promotes *COOH formation. As a result, the Ca&#8208;N3O catalyst exhibits a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art turnover frequency of &#8776;15&#160;000 per hour in an H&#8208;cell and a large current density of &#8722;400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a CO Faradaic efficiency (FE) &#8805; 90% in a flow cell. Moreover, Ca&#8208;N3O sites retain a FE above 90% even with a 30% diluted CO2 concentration.

         <title>Blood&#8208;Glucose&#8208;Powered Metabolic Fuel Cell for Self&#8208;Sufficient Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This blood&#8208;glucose&#8208;powered metabolic fuel cell (MFC) converts excess glucose into electrical energy, while generating enough power to stimulate (electro&#8208;opto) vesicular release of insulin from engineered beta&#8208;cells. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept in hyperglycemic conditions, the subcutaneously implanted MFC drove depolarization of engineered beta&#8208;cells to trigger release of insulin, reducing blood glucose, and restoring normo&#8208;glycemia via self&#8208;sufficient closed&#8208;loop control in type&#8208;1 diabetic mice.








Abstract
Currently available bioelectronic devices consume too much power to be continuously operated on rechargeable batteries, and are often powered wirelessly, with attendant issues regarding reliability, convenience, and mobility. Thus, the availability of a robust, self&#8208;sufficient, implantable electrical power generator that works under physiological conditions would be transformative for many applications, from driving bioelectronic implants and prostheses to programing cellular behavior and patients&#8217; metabolism. Here, capitalizing on a new copper&#8208;containing, conductively tuned 3D carbon nanotube composite, an implantable blood&#8208;glucose&#8208;powered metabolic fuel cell is designed that continuously monitors blood&#8208;glucose levels, converts excess glucose into electrical power during hyperglycemia, and produces sufficient energy (0.7&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 0.9&#160;V, 50&#160;mm glucose) to drive opto&#8208; and electro&#8208;genetic regulation of vesicular insulin release from engineered beta cells. It is shown that this integration of blood&#8208;glucose monitoring with elimination of excessive blood glucose by combined electro&#8208;metabolic conversion and insulin&#8208;release&#8208;mediated cellular consumption enables the metabolic fuel cell to restore blood&#8208;glucose homeostasis in an automatic, self&#8208;sufficient, and closed&#8208;loop manner in an experimental model of type&#8208;1 diabetes.

         <title>Self&#8208;Accommodation Induced Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction on Ruthenium Site for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supported nanoparticle catalyst of Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C is prepared by inducing the self&#8208;accommodation of ruthenium nanoparticles (Ru) on Fe3O4 and carbon support through electronic metal&#8208;support interaction. Charge redistribution results in electronic perturbation, and directly influences adsorption behavior during the catalytic process.








Abstract
Tuning the metal&#8208;support interaction of supported metal catalysts has been found to be the most effective approach to modulating electronic structure and improving catalytic performance. But practical understanding of the charge transfer mechanism at the electronic level of catalysis process has remained elusive. Here, it is reported that ruthenium (Ru) nanoparticles can self&#8208;accommodate into Fe3O4 and carbon support (Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C) through the electronic metal&#8208;support interaction, resulting in robust catalytic activity toward the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Spectroscopic evidence and theoretical calculations demonstrate that electronic perturbation occurred in the Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C, and that charge redistribution directly influenced adsorption behavior during the catalytic process. The Ru&#63743;O bond formed by orbital mixing changes the charge state of the surface Ru site, enabling more electrons to flow to H intermediates (H*) for favorable adsorption. The weak binding strength of the Ru&#63743;O bond also reinforces the anti&#8208;bonding character of H* with a more favorable recombination of H* species into H2 molecules. Because of this satisfactory catalytic mechanism, the Ru&#8208;Fe3O4/C supported nanoparticle catalyst demonstrated better HER activity and robust stability than the benchmark commercial Pt/C benchmark in alkaline media.

         <title>Dihydroxyterephthalate&#8212;A Trojan Horse PET Counit for Facile Chemical Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) plastics undergo selective hydrolysis of ester bonds through the incorporation of biobased diethyl 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE)&#160;counits into polymer backbone, which facilitates low&#8208;energy PET chemical recycling from the solid state in water. Composition&#8208;optimized copolymers show a decrease of nearly 50% in activation energy and 6&#8208;order reduction in depolymerization time compared to PET homopolymer while maintaining key properties of PET.








Abstract
Here, low&#8208;energy poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) chemical recycling in water: PET copolymers with diethyl 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE) undergo selective hydrolysis at DHTE sites, autocatalyzed by neighboring group participation, is demonstrated. Liberated oligomeric subchains further hydrolyze until only small molecules remain. Poly(ethylene terephthalate&#8208;stat&#8208;2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalate) copolymers were&#160;synthesized via melt polycondensation and then hydrolyzed in 150&#8211;200 &#176;C water with 0&#8211;1 wt% ZnCl2, or alternatively in simulated sea water. Degradation progress follows pseudo&#8208;first order kinetics. With increasing DHTE loading, the rate constant increases monotonically while the thermal activation barrier decreases. The depolymerization products are ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, 2,5&#8208;dihydroxyterephthalic acid, and bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate dimer, which could be used to regenerate virgin polymer. Composition&#8208;optimized copolymers show a decrease of nearly 50% in the Arrhenius activation energy, suggesting a 6&#8208;order reduction in depolymerization time under ambient conditions compared to that of PET homopolymer. This study provides new insight to the design of polymers for end&#8208;of&#8208;life while maintaining key properties like service temperature and mechanical properties. Moreover, this chemical recycling procedure is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional approaches since water is the only needed material, which is green, sustainable, and cheap.

&lt;p&gt;Here, low-energy poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) chemical recycling in water: PET copolymers with diethyl 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE) undergo selective hydrolysis at DHTE sites, autocatalyzed by neighboring group participation, is demonstrated. Liberated oligomeric subchains further hydrolyze until only small molecules remain. Poly(ethylene terephthalate-&lt;i&gt;stat&lt;/i&gt;-2,5-dihydroxyterephthalate) copolymers were&#160;synthesized via melt polycondensation and then hydrolyzed in 150&#8211;200 &#176;C water with 0&#8211;1 wt% ZnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or alternatively in simulated sea water. Degradation progress follows pseudo-first order kinetics. With increasing DHTE loading, the rate constant increases monotonically while the thermal activation barrier decreases. The depolymerization products are ethylene glycol, terephthalic acid, 2,5-dihydroxyterephthalic acid, and bis(2-hydroxyethyl) terephthalate dimer, which could be used to regenerate virgin polymer. Composition-optimized copolymers show a decrease of nearly 50% in the Arrhenius activation energy, suggesting a 6-order reduction in depolymerization time under ambient conditions compared to that of PET homopolymer. This study provides new insight to the design of polymers for end-of-life while maintaining key properties like service temperature and mechanical properties. Moreover, this chemical recycling procedure is more environmentally friendly compared to traditional approaches since water is the only needed material, which is green, sustainable, and cheap.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>RNA&#8208;Targeting Carbon Dots for Live&#8208;Cell Imaging of Granule Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots&#160;(M&#8208;CDs)&#160;are synthesized, microwave&#8208;assisted, by elaborately choosing precursors and spatial organization of the emission centers and recognition motifs. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs show bulk RNA binding and labeling capability in live cells and are further utilized for high&#8208;resolution spatiotemporal imaging of granules dynamics under oxidative stress.








Abstract
It is significant to monitor the different RNA granules dynamics and phase separation process inside cells under various stresses, for example, oxidative stress. The current small&#8208;molecule RNA probes work well only in fixed cells and usually encounter problems such as insufficient stability and biocompatibility, and thus a specific RNA&#8208;targeting fluorescent nanoprobe that&#160;can be used in the living cells is urgently desired. Here, the de novo design and microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of a novel RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive carbon dots (named as M&#8208;CDs) are reported by choosing neutral red and levofloxacin as precursors. The as&#8208;synthesized M&#8208;CDs is water&#8208;soluble with a high fluorescence quantum yield of 22.83% and can selectively bind to RNA resulting in an enhanced red fluorescence. More interestingly, such an RNA&#8208;targeting, red&#8208;emissive M&#8208;CDs can be fast internalized into cells within 5&#160;s and thus used for real&#8208;time imaging the dynamic process of intracellular stress granules under oxidative stress, revealing some characteristics of granules that have not been identified by previously reported RNA and protein biomarkers. This research paves a new pathway for visualizing bulk RNA dynamics and studying phase&#8208;separation behaviors in living cells by rational design of the fluorescent carbon dots in terms of structure and functionality.

         <title>Ionic Liquid &#8220;Water Pocket&#8221; for Stable and Environment&#8208;Adaptable Aqueous Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;hydrophobic ionic liquid binary system is found to experience spontaneous miscibility transition by introducing Zn salts bearing amphiphilic functional group, forming a novel class of aqueous electrolytes, in which the ionic liquid species function as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221; to envelop the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protect them from parasitic reactions during the operation of zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The strong reactivity of water in aqueous electrolytes toward metallic zinc (Zn), especially at aggressive operating conditions, remains the fundamental obstacle to the commercialization of aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs). Here, a water&#8208;immiscible ionic liquid diluent 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium bis(fluorosulfonyl)amide (EmimFSI) is reported that can substantially suppress the water activity of aqueous electrolyte by serving as a &#8220;water pocket&#8221;, enveloping the highly active H2O&#8208;dominated Zn2+ solvates and protecting them from parasitic reactions. During Zn deposition, the cation Emim+ and anion FSI&#8722; function respectively in mitigating the tip effect and regulating the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), thereby favoring a smooth Zn deposition layer protected by inorganic species&#8208;enriched SEI featuring high uniformity and stability. Combined with the boosted chemical/electrochemical stability endowed by the intrinsic merits of ionic liquid, this ionic liquid&#8208;incorporated aqueous electrolyte (IL&#8208;AE) enables the stable operation of Zn||Zn0.25V2O5&#183;nH2O cells even at a challenging temperature of 60&#160;&#176;C (&gt;85% capacity retention over 400 cycles). Finally, as an incidental but practically valuable benefit, the near&#8208;zero vapor pressure nature of ionic liquid allows the efficient separation and recovery of high&#8208;value components from the spent electrolyte via a mild and green approach, promising the sustainable future of IL&#8208;AE in realizing practical AZMBs.

         <title>Extremely Strong and Tough Biodegradable Poly(urethane) Elastomers with Unprecedented Crack Tolerance via Hierarchical Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The biodegradable poly(urethane) elastomer of polycaprolactone (PCL) is engineered to possess abundant and hierarchical hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions which hinder the crystallization of PCL segments and facilitate the formation of uniformly distributed hard&#8208;phase microdomains inside the elastomer, miraculously realizing the extremely high strength and toughness and unprecedented crack resistance for biomedical application as hernia patches.








Abstract
The elastomers with the combination of high strength and high toughness have always been intensively pursued due to their diverse applications. Biomedical applications frequently require elastomers with biodegradability and biocompatibility properties. It remains a great challenge to prepare the biodegradable elastomers with extremely robust mechanical properties for in vivo use. In this report,&#160;we&#160;present a polyurethane elastomer with unprecedented mechanical properties for the in vivo application as hernia patches, which&#160;was&#160;obtained by the solvent&#8208;free reaction of polycaprolactone (PCL) and isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI) with N,N&#8208;bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)oxamide (BHO) as the chain extender. Abundant and hierarchical hydrogen&#8208;bonding interactions inside the elastomers hinder the crystallization of PCL segments and facilitate the formation of uniformly distributed hard phase microdomains, which miraculously realize the extremely high strength and toughness with the fracture strength of 92.2&#160;MPa and true stress of 1.9&#160;GPa, while maintaining the elongation&#8208;at&#8208;break of &#8776;1900% and ultrahigh toughness of 480.2&#160;MJ m&#8722;3 with the unprecedented fracture energy of 322.2&#160;kJ m&#8722;2. Hernia patches made from the elastomer via 3D printing technology exhibit outstanding mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. The robust and biodegradable elastomers demonstrate considerable potentials for in vivo applications.

         <title>Multifunctional Hybrid Interfacial Layers for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet scalable interfacial layer consisting of self&#8208;assembled molecule and conjugated polymer facilitates resolving bilateral surface issues between charge&#8208;selective metal oxide and perovskite, successfully leading to high&#8208;performance inverted perovskite solar cells and modules.








Abstract
Challenges remain hindering the performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), particularly for the nonstable interface between lead halide perovskite and charge extraction metal oxide layer. Herein, a simple yet scalable interfacial strategy to facilitate the assemble of high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is reported. The hybrid interfacial layer containing self&#8208;assembly triphenylamine and conjugated poly(arylamine) simultaneously improves the chemical stability, charge extraction, and energy level alignment of hole&#8208;selective interface, meanwhile promoting perovskite crystallization. Consequently, the correspondent inverted PSCs and modules achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 24.5% and 20.7% (aperture area of 19.4 cm2), respectively. The PSCs maintain over 80% of its initial efficiency under one&#8208;sun equivalent illumination of 1200 h. This strategy is also effective to perovskite with various bandgaps, demonstrating the highest PCE of 19.6% for the 1.76&#8208;eV bandgap PSCs. Overall, this work provides a simple yet scalable interfacial strategy for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art inverted PSCs and modules.

         <title>Colorful Triplet Excitons in Carbon Nanodots for Time Delay Lighting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colorful triplet excitons from ultraviolet to near infrared in carbon nanodots (CNDs) are achieved via luminescent conjugate size adjustment and spatial confinement, and time decay light&#8208;emitting diodes using the eco&#8208;friendly CNDs&#8208;based long&#8208;lifetime emission materials have been demonstrated.








Abstract
Time delay lighting offers an added period of buffer illumination for human eyes upon switching off the light. Long&#8208;lifetime emission from triplet excitons has outstanding potential, but the forbidden transition property due to the Pauli exclusion principle makes them dark, and it stays challenging to develop full&#8208;color and bright triplet excitons. Herein, triplet excitons emission from ultraviolet (UV) to near infrared (NIR) in carbon nanodots (CNDs) is achieved by confining multicolor CNDs emitters in NaCNO crystal. NaCNO crystal can isolate the CNDs, triplet excitons quenching caused by the excited state electrons aggregation induced energy transfer is suppressed, and the confinement crystal can furthermore promote phosphorescence of the CNDs by inhibiting the dissipation of the triplet excitons due to non&#8208;radiative transition. The phosphorescence from radiative recombination of triplet excitons in the CNDs covers the spectral region from 300&#160;nm (UV) to 800&#160;nm (NIR), the corresponding lifetimes can reach 15.8, 818.0, 239.7, 168.4, 426.4, and 127.6&#160;ms. Furthermore, the eco&#8208;friendly luminescent lampshades are designed based on the multicolor phosphorescent CNDs, time delay light&#8208;emitting diodes are thus demonstrated. The findings will motivate new opportunities for the development of UV to NIR phosphorescent CNDs and time delay lighting applications.

         <title>Environmentally Stable, Robust, Adhesive, and Conductive Supramolecular Deep Eutectic Gels as Ultrasensitive Flexible Temperature Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular deep eutectic gels are prepared by polymerization of deep eutectic solvent consisting of lithium salt and N&#8208;cyanomethyl acrylamide with an amide group and a cyano group in the side chain whose hydrogen bonds and dipole&#8208;dipole interactions contribute to high strength, stickiness, temperature&#8208;sensitiveness, 3D printability, and ionic conductivity. This novel gel can be developed as a wireless temperature monitor.








Abstract
It is essential and of great significance to impart high mechanical performance, environmental stability, and high sensitivity to emerging flexible temperature sensors. In this work, polymerizable deep eutectic solvents are designed and prepared by simply mixing N&#8208;cyanomethyl acrylamide (NCMA) containing an amide group and a cyano group in the same side chain with lithium bis(trifluoromethane) sulfonimide (LiTFSI), and obtain supramolecular deep eutectic polyNCMA/LiTFSI gels after polymerization. These supramolecular gels exhibit excellent mechanical performance (tensile strength of 12.9&#160;MPa and fracture energy of 45.3&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), strong adhesion force, high&#8208;temperature responsiveness, self&#8208;healing ability, and shape memory behavior due to the reversible reconstruction ability of amide hydrogen bonds and cyano&#8208;cyano dipole&#8208;dipole interactions in the gel network. In addition, the gels also demonstrate good environmental stability and 3D printability. To verify its application potential as a flexible temperature sensor, the polyNCMA/LiTFSI gel&#8208;based wireless temperature monitor is developed and displays outstanding thermal sensitivity (8.4%/K) over a wide detection range. The preliminary result also suggests the promising potential of PNCMA gel as a pressure sensor.

         <title>Compromising Charge Generation and Recombination of Organic Photovoltaics with Mixed Diluent Strategy for Certified 19.4% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed diluent strategy is proposed to better compromise the charge generation and recombination for multicomponent organic photovoltaics (MC&#8208;OPVs), which involve a large bandgap and a low bandgap nonfullerene acceptors as diluent. This strategy improves balance between photocurrent and open&#8208;circuit voltage, and enables a power conversion efficiency of 19.76% (certified 19.41%), which represents a world record of single&#8208;junction OPV.








Abstract
The ternary blend is demonstrated as an effective strategy to promote the device performance of organic photovoltaics (OPVs) due to the dilution effect. While the compromise between the charge generation and recombination remains a challenge. Here, a mixed diluent strategy for further improving the device efficiency of OPV is proposed. Specifically, the high&#8208;performance OPV system with a polymer donor, i.e., PM6, and a nonfullerene acceptor (NFA), i.e., BTP&#8208;eC9, is diluted by the mixed diluents, which involve a high bandgap NFA of BTP&#8208;S17 and a low bandgap NFA of BTP&#8208;S16 (similar with that of the BTP&#8208;eC9). The BTP&#8208;S17 of better miscibility with BTP&#8208;eC9 can dramatically enhance the open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), while the BTP&#8208;S16 maximizes the charge generation or the short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC). The interplay of BTP&#8208;17 and BTP&#8208;S16 enables better compromise between charge generation and recombination, thus leading to a high device performance of 19.76% (certified 19.41%), which is the best among single&#8208;junction OPVs. Further analysis on carrier dynamics validates the efficacy of mixed diluents for balancing charge generation and recombination, which can be further attributed to the more diverse energetic landscapes and improved morphology. Therefore, this work provides an effective strategy for high&#8208;performance OPV for further commercialization.

         <title>Benzo[d]thiazole Based Wide Bandgap Donor Polymers Enable 19.54% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells Along with Desirable Batch&#8208;to&#8208;Batch Reproducibility and General Applicability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new series of wide bandgap polymer donors based on the benzo[d]thiazole unit are designed along with systematical side chain engineering for efficient organic solar cells, realizing high efficiencies of 18.57% and 19.54% in the binary and ternary blend devices.








Abstract
The limited selection pool of high&#8208;performance wide bandgap (WBG) polymer donors is a bottleneck problem of the nonfullerene acceptor (NFA) based organic solar cells (OSCs) that impedes the further improvement of their photovoltaic performances. Herein, a series of new WBG polymers, namely PH&#8208;BTz, PS&#8208;BTz, PF&#8208;BTz, and PCl&#8208;BTz, are developed by using the bicyclic difluoro&#8208;benzo[d]thiazole (BTz) as the acceptor block and benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene (BDT) derivatives as the donor units. By introducing S, F, and Cl atoms to the alkylthienyl sidechains on BDT, the resulting polymers exhibit lowered energy levels and enhanced aggregation properties. The fluorinated PBTz&#8208;F not only exhibits a low&#8208;lying HOMO level, but also has stronger face&#8208;on packing order and results in more uniform fibril&#8208;like interpenetrating networks in the related PF&#8208;BTz:L8&#8208;BO blend. A high&#8208;power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.57% is achieved. Moreover, PBTz&#8208;F also exhibits a good batch&#8208;to&#8208;batch reproducibility and general applicability. In addition, ternary blend OSCs based on the host PBTz&#8208;F:L8&#8208;BO blend and PM6 guest donor exhibits a further enhanced PCE of 19.54%, which is among the highest values of OSCs.

         <title>Multifunctional Coatings on Sulfide&#8208;Based Solid Electrolyte Powders with Enhanced Processability, Stability, and Performance for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By leveraging the versatility of atomic layer deposition, multifunctional coatings are grown on sulfide&#8208;based argyrodite solid&#8208;state electrolytes that improve their (electro)chemical stability and performance for lithium metal batteries. This work highlights a completely new framework for designing active and stable materials for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) exhibit many tantalizing properties including high ionic conductivity and favorable mechanical properties for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries. Widespread adoption of these materials is hindered by their intrinsic instability under ambient conditions, which makes them difficult to process at scale, and instability at the Li||SSE and cathode||SSE interfaces, which limits cell performance and lifetime. Atomic layer deposition is leveraged to grow thin Al2O3 coatings on Li6PS5Cl powders to address both issues simultaneously. These coatings can be directly grown onto Li6PS5Cl particles with negligible chemical modification of the underlying material and enable exposure of powders to pure and H2O&#8208;saturated oxygen environments for &#8805;4 h with minimal reactivity, compared with significant degradation of the uncoated powder. Pellets fabricated from coated powders exhibit ionic conductivities up to 2&#215; higher than those made from uncoated material, with a simultaneous decrease in electronic conductivity and significant suppression of chemical reactivity at the Li&#8208;SSE interface. These benefits result in significantly improved room temperature cycle life at high capacity and current density. It is hypothesized that this enhanced performance derives from improved intergranular properties and improved Li metal adhesion. This work points to a completely new framework for designing active, stable, and scalable materials for next&#8208;generation solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Biomimetic Construction of Ferrite Quantum Dot/Graphene Heterostructure for Enhancing Ion/Charge Transfer in Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to construct a series of spinel ferrite quantum dot/graphene (XFe2O4 QD/G) heterostructures. The biomimetic mineralization strategy can precisely tune complex architectures by slowing down the reaction kinetics. The combination of ferrite QD and graphene provides rich redox active sites and boosts the ion/charge transfer, improving their capacitive and cyclic performances.








Abstract
Spinel ferrites are regarded as promising electrode materials for supercapacitors (SCs) in virtue of their low cost and high theoretical specific capacitances. However, bulk ferrites suffer from limited electrical conductivity, sluggish ion transport, and inadequate active sites. Therefore, rational structural design and composition regulation of the ferrites are approaches to overcome these limitations. Herein, a general biomimetic mineralization synthetic strategy is proposed to synthesize ferrite (XFe2O4, X = Ni, Co, Mn) quantum dot/graphene (QD/G) heterostructures. Anchoring ferrite QD on the graphene sheets not only strengthens the structural stability, but also forms the electrical conductivity network needed to boost the ion diffusion and charge transfer. The optimized NiFe2O4 QD/G heterostructure exhibits specific capacitances of 697.5 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, and exceptional cycling performance. Furthermore, the fabricated symmetrical SCs deliver energy densities of 24.4 and 17.4&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at power densities of 499.3 and 4304.2&#160;W kg&#8722;1, respectively. Density functional theory calculations indicate the combination of NiFe2O4 QD and graphene facilitates the adsorption of potassium atoms, ensuring rapid ion/charge transfer. This work enriches the application of the biomimetic mineralization synthesis and provides effective strategies for boosting ion/charge transfer, which may offer a new way to develop advanced electrodes for SCs.

Chemically Recyclable Plastics
In article number 2210154, Ting&#8208;Han Lee, George Kraus, Eric Cochran, and co&#8208;workers report dihydroxyterephthalate (DHTE) as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; co&#8208;unit in poly(ethylene terephthalate) to produce highly recyclable plastics. The DHTE enables chemical recycling via hydrolysis to monomers in pure water by acting as an internal catalyst through neighboring group participation.

Magnetic Topological Insulators
Inelastic neutron scattering measurements, as reported by Farhan Islam and co&#8208;workers in article number 2209951, reveal the formation of linear Mn&#8211;Te&#8211;Mn antiferromagnetic dimers in Mn&#8208;doped Sb2Te3 magnetic topological insulators, following the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori superexchange rule. The experiments also identify ferromagnetic correlations within quintuple blocks and across the van der Waals gap, which mediate long&#8208;range ferromagnetic order. These competing interactions explain the role of defects in tuning ground states in magnetic topological insulators.

Biomaterials
In article number 2205709, Christian C. Schreib, Omid Veiseh, and co&#8208;workers explore how lipid deposition affects the way the body responds to implanted biomaterials. They discover that certain types of phospholipids tend to accumulate on immune&#8208;evasive implants, while different sets of fatty acid lipids deposit on immunogenic implants. These lipids directly impact the transcriptome of macrophages found on the surface of the implant materials.

         <title>Emerging 2D Metal Oxides: From Synthesis to Device Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Emerging 2D metal oxides exhibit intriguing electronic and optical properties, which have great potential in emerging functional devices. Diverse structures and various synthesis methods open a new field of vision for device&#8208;fabrication&#8208;based 2D metal oxides. Their unique properties can bring new vigor and vitality into 2D material family.








Abstract
2D metal oxides have aroused increasing attention in the field of electronics and optoelectronics due to their intriguing physical properties. In this review, an overview of recent advances on synthesis of 2D metal oxides and their electronic applications is presented. First, the tunable physical properties of 2D metal oxides that relate to the structure (various oxidation&#8208;state forms, polymorphism, etc.), crystallinity and defects (anisotropy, point defects, and grain boundary), and thickness (quantum confinement effect, interfacial effect, etc.) are discussed. Then, advanced synthesis methods for 2D metal oxides besides mechanical exfoliation are introduced and classified into solution process, vapor&#8208;phase deposition, and native oxidation on a metal source. Later, the various roles of 2D metal oxides in widespread applications, i.e., transistors, inverters, photodetectors, piezotronics, memristors, and potential applications (solar cell, spintronics, and superconducting devices) are discussed. Finally, an outlook of existing challenges and future opportunities in 2D metal oxides is proposed.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Radiotherapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment to Enhance Antitumor Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The principles of radiotherapy (RT) and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT are discussed and tumor microenvironments (TMEs) for enhanced antitumor efficacy are remodeled. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to eradicate localized tumors and, in rare cases, control tumors outside of the irradiated fields via stimulating an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect). However, the therapeutic effect of RT is often limited by inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix (ECM), and an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, it is critical to develop new RT strategies that can remodel the TME to overcome radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression. In the past decade, high&#8208;Z&#8208;element nanoparticles have been developed to increase radiotherapeutic indices of localized tumors by reducing X&#8208;ray doses and side effects to normal tissues and enhance abscopal effects by activating the TME to elicit systemic antitumor immunity. In this review, the principles of RT and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT and remodel TMEs for enhanced antitumor efficacy are discussed. The challenges in clinical translation of multifunctional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers are also highlighted.

Abstract
The global outbreaks of infectious diseases have significantly driven an imperative demand for rapid and accurate molecular diagnostics. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) feature high sensitivity and high specificity; however, the labor&#8208;intensive sample preparation and nucleic acid amplification steps remain challenging in order to carry out rapid and precision molecular diagnostics at home. This review discusses the advances and challenges of automatic solutions of sample preparation integrated with on&#8208;chip nucleic acid amplification for effective and accurate molecular diagnostics at home. The sample preparation methods of whole blood, urine, saliva/nasal swab, and stool on chip are examined. Then, the repurposable integrated sample preparation on a chip using various biological samples is investigated. Finally, the on&#8208;chip NAATs that can be integrated with automated sample preparation are evaluated. The user&#8208;friendly approaches with combined sample preparation and NAATs can be the game changers for next&#8208;generation rapid and precision home diagnostics.

         <title>In Response to Precision Medicine: Current Subcellular Targeting Strategies for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 21, May 25, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Subcellular targeting is very promising for cancer treatment. The recent progress of subcellular targeting strategies is summarized, concentrating on direct and indirect targeting of four main organelles (mitochondria, lysosome, endoplasm reticulum, and nucleus) on the basis of various formulations. Finally, prospects and challenges of subcellular targeting are also discussed.








Abstract
Emerging as a potent anticancer treatment, subcellular targeted cancer therapy has drawn increasing attention, bringing great opportunities for clinical application. Here, two targeting strategies for four main subcellular organelles (mitochondria, lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, and nucleus), including molecule&#8208; and nanomaterial (inorganic nanoparticles, micelles, organic polymers, and others)&#8208;based targeted delivery or therapeutic strategies, are summarized. Phototherapy, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, and &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; combination therapy are among the strategies covered in detail. Such materials are constructed based on the specific properties and relevant mechanisms of organelles, enabling the elimination of tumors by inducing dysfunction in the corresponding organelles or destroying specific structures. The challenges faced by organelle&#8208;targeting cancer therapies are also summarized. Looking forward, a paradigm for organelle&#8208;targeting therapy with enhanced therapeutic efficacy compared to current clinical approaches is envisioned.

         <title>An Amphiphilic Entangled Network Design Toward Ultratough Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic hydrogels with ultrahigh toughness and durability are prepared by mixing a hydrophobic polymer into a hydrophilic matrix. Fine crystallites stiffen the network, which can endure long&#8208;term shear. Dense chain entanglements enable large tensile deformation with low hysteresis. The resulting gels can retain both hydrophilic and lipophilic molecules.








Abstract
Hydrogels find important roles in biomedicine, wearable electronics, and soft robotics, but their mechanical properties are often unsatisfactory. Conventional tough hydrogel designs are based on hydrophilic networks with sacrificial bonds, while the incorporation of hydrophobic polymers into hydrogels is less well understood. In this work, a hydrogel toughening strategy is demonstrated by introducing a hydrophobic polymer as reinforcement. Semicrystalline hydrophobic polymer chains are &#8220;woven&#8221; into a hydrophilic network via entropy&#8208;driven miscibility. In&#8208;situ&#8208;formed sub&#8208;micrometer crystallites stiffen the network, while entanglements between hydrophobic polymer and hydrophilic network enable large deformation before failure. The hydrogels are stiff, tough, and durable at high swelling ratios of 6&#8211;10, and the mechanical properties are tunable. Moreover, they can effectively encapsulate both hydrophobic and hydrophilic molecules.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by charge&#8211;carrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0 cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#8201;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

         <title>Formation Of Amorphous Iron&#8208;Calcium Phosphate With High Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Amorphous iron&#8208;calcium phosphate (Fe&#8208;ACP) plays a vital role in the mechanical properties of teeth of some rodents, which are very hard, but its formation process and synthetic route remain unknown. Here, we report the synthesis and characterization of an iron&#8208;bearing amorphous calcium phosphate in the presence of ammonium iron citrate (AIC). The iron is distributed homogeneously on the nanometer scale in the resulting particles. The prepared Fe&#8208;ACP particles can be highly stable in aqueous media, including water, simulated body fluid and acetate buffer solution (pH 4). In vitro study demonstrates that these particles have good biocompatibility and osteogenic properties. Subsequently, Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) is utilized to consolidate the initial Fe&#8208;ACP powders. The results show that the hardness of the ceramics increases with the increase of iron content, but an excess of iron leads to a rapid decline in hardness. Calcium iron phosphate ceramics with a hardness of 4 GPa can be achieved, which is higher than that of human enamel. Furthermore, the ceramics composed of iron&#8208;calcium phosphates showed enhanced acid resistance. This study provides a novel route to prepare Fe&#8208;ACP, and presents the potential role of Fe&#8208;ACP in biomineralization and as starting material to fabricate acid&#8208;resistant high&#8208;performance bioceramics.

         <title>Surface Optics and Color Effects of Liquid Metal Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid metals are a kind of low&#8208;melting&#8208;point alloys, usually appearing silvery&#8208;white. Colorful liquid metals can be prepared by different strategies, including the coating and compounding, physical vapor deposition/chemical vapor deposition, structural color, external stimuli, and fluorescence functionalization. The color and fluorescence functionalization of liquid metals have broken through the limitations of the conventional single&#8208;color physical appearance, and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure.








Abstract
Liquid metals (LMs) are emerging as new functional materials with rather unique physical or chemical behaviors. They are generally safe and nontoxic, have high boiling points, reflectivities, good thermal and electrical conductivities, flexibility, fluidity, self&#8208;healing capability and remain in liquid state at room temperature. However, the further applications of LMs are limited by their single&#8208;color physical appearance, such as working in the situations with imposed stringent requirements for color and aesthetics. Recently, the color and fluorescence functionalization of LMs have overcome many conventional technical bottlenecks and opened significant potential for emerging applications in numerous fields owing to their rich colors and unique liquid structure. In this review, the recent developments in the optical properties, color and fluorescence effects of LMs are comprehensively investigated. The synthesis, structures, properties, chromogenic mechanisms, and potential photoelectric applications of colorful LMs are systematically analyzed and compared. The effectiveness and characteristics of colorful LMs induced by coating, mixing, compounding, surface modification, external stimuli are provided, aiming to establish a potential system for the synthesis and practices of colorful LMs. Finally, the challenges and prospects in the field have also been identified and explained to preferably guide further scientific and technical research in the coming time.

         <title>Halides&#8208;Enhanced Buried Interfaces for Stable and Extremely Low&#8208;Voltage&#8208;Deficit Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple, facile, and versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides is developed for strengthening the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface, in which precise manipulation of perovskite defects and carrier dynamics has been realized by altering halide electronegativity (&#967;).








Abstract
The perovskite buried interfaces have demonstrated pivotal roles in determining both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs);&#160;however, challenges remain in understanding and managing the interfaces due to their non&#8208;exposed feature. Here, we proposed a versatile strategy of pre&#8208;grafted halides to strengthen the SnO2&#8211;perovskite buried interface by precisely manipulating perovskite defects and carrier dynamics through alteration of halide electronegativity (&#967;), thereby resulting in both favorable perovskite crystallization and minimized interfacial carrier losses. Specifically, the implementation of fluoride with the highest &#967; induces the strongest binding affinity to uncoordinated SnO2&#160;defects and perovskite cations, leading to retarded perovskite crystallization and high&#8208;quality perovskite films with reduced residual stress. These improved properties enable champion efficiencies of 24.2% (the control: 20.5%) and 22.1% (the control: 18.7%) in rigid and flexible devices with extremely low voltage deficit down to 386&#160;mV, all of which are among the highest reported values for PSCs with a similar device architecture. In addition, the resulting devices exhibit marked improvements in the device longevity under various stressors of humidity (&gt;5000&#160;h), light (1000&#160;h), heat (180&#160;h), and bending test (10&#160;000&#160;times). This method provides an effective way to improve the quality of buried interfaces toward high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Heteroatom&#8208;Driven Coordination Fields Altering Single Cerium Atom Sites for Efficient Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through ubtle modulation of the coordination environments by introducing P and S heteroatoms, the Ce electroactive sites are modulated to achieve effective enhancement of the oxygen reduction reaction's intrinsic catalytic activity. This work supplies significant references for optimizing the electroactivity of atomic catalysts by a coordination regulation strategy.








Abstract
For current single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), modulating the coordination environments of rare&#8208;earth (RE) single atoms with complex electronic orbital and flexible chemical states is still limited. Herein, cerium (Ce) SAs supported on a P, S, and N co&#8208;doped hollow carbon substrate (Ce SAs/PSNC) for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) are reported. The as&#8208;prepared Ce SAs/PSNC possesses a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.90&#160;V, a turnover frequency value of 52.2&#160;s&#8722;1 at 0.85&#160;V, and excellent stability for the ORR, which exceeds the commercial Pt/C and most recent SACs. Ce SAs/PSNC&#8208;based liquid zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) exhibit a high and stable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.49&#160;V and a maximum power density of 212&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2. As the catalyst of the air cathode, it also displays remarkable performance in flexible electronic devices. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of S and P sites induces significant electronic modulations to the Ce SA active sites. The P and S dopings promote the electroactivity of Ce SAs and improve the overall site&#8208;to&#8208;site electron transfer within the Ce SAs/PSNC. This work offers a unique perspective for modulating RE&#8208;based SACs in a complex coordination environment toward superior electrocatalysis and broad applications in energy conversion and storage devices.

         <title>An Overstretch Strategy to Double the Designed Elastic Stretchability of Stretchable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An overstretch strategy is proposed, which is applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to the soft substrate. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching.








Abstract
Achieving or enhancing the elastic stretchability of inorganic stretchable electronics is critically significant. However, only two types of fundamental strategies&#8212;using the prestrained elastic substrate and designing the geometric layouts&#8212;are exploited thus far. This study proposes a third strategy, an overstretch strategy, applied beyond the designed elastic range of stretchable structures after transfer printing and bonding to a soft substrate. The theoretical, numerical, and experimental results collectively prove that the overstretch strategy can double the designed elastic stretchability of fabricated stretchable electronics and is valid for various geometrical interconnects with both thick and thin cross&#8208;sections. The underlying mechanism is that the elastic range of the critical part of the stretchable structure is doubled, owing to the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relation during overstretching. The overstretch strategy can be easily executed and combined with the other two strategies to enhance elastic stretchability, which has profound implications for the design, fabrication, and applications of inorganic stretchable electronics.

         <title>Inorganic Perovskite Surface Reconfiguration for Stable Inverted Solar Cells with 20.38% Efficiency and Its Application in Tandem Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward method involves utilizing 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) to fabricate efficient inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film. A record&#8208;breaking efficiency of 20.38% for p&#8211;i&#8211;n single&#8208;junction IPSCs is obtained. Furthermore, an inorganic perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is successfully demonstrated, with an impressive efficiency of 25.31%.








Abstract
Inorganic perovskite solar cells (IPSCs) have garnered attention in tandem solar cells (TSCs) due to their suitable bandgap and impressive thermal stability. However, the efficiency of inverted IPSCs has been limited by the high trap density on the top surface of inorganic perovskite film. Herein, a method for fabricating efficient IPSCs by reconfiguring the surface properties of CsPbI2.85Br0.15 film with 2&#8208;amino&#8208;5&#8208;bromobenzamide (ABA) is developed. This modification not only exhibits the synergistic coordination of carbonyl (C=O) and amino (NH2) groups with uncoordinated Pb2+, but also the Br fills halide vacancies and suppresses the formation of Pb0, effectively passivating the defective top surface. As a result, a champion efficiency of 20.38%, the highest efficiency reported for inverted IPSCs to date is achieved. Furthermore, the successful fabrication of a p&#8211;i&#8211;n type monolithic inorganic perovskite/silicon TSCs with an efficiency of 25.31% for the first time is demonstrated. Crucially, the unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated IPSCs shows enhanced photostability, retaining 80.33% of its initial efficiency after 270&#160;h, and thermal stability (maintain 85.98% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h at 65&#160;&#176;C). The unencapsulated ABA&#8208;treated TSCs also retains 92.59% of its initial efficiency after 200&#160;h under continuous illumination in ambient air.

         <title>(111)&#8208;Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high&#8208;quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI2 leads to the direct crystallization of (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. Solar cells based on (111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.








Abstract
Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain&#8208;to&#8208;grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI3) films based on one&#8208;step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI2&#8226;DMSO, FA2Pb3I8&#8226;4DMSO, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 to &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Here, a high&#8208;quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)&#8208;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) using a short&#8208;chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported.

     alt="(111)-Dominated Perovskite Films by Antisolvent Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Antisolvent engineering is proposed to realize high-quality dominantly oriented perovskite film by the antisolvent of isopropyl alcohol (IPA). The interaction between IPA and PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to the direct crystallization of (111)-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature, sidestepping the intermediates of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;DMSO, FA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;4DMSO, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Solar cells based on (111)-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrate improved performance compared to the randomly oriented perovskite films treated by other antisolvents.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fabricating perovskite films with a dominant crystal orientation is an effective path to realizing quasi-single-crystal perovskite film, which can eliminate the fluctuation of the electrical properties in films arising from grain-to-grain variations, and improve the performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite (FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) films based on one-step antisolvent methods usually suffer from chaotic orientations due to the inevitable intermediate phase conversion from intermediates of PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;DMSO, FA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;&#8226;4DMSO, and &lt;i&gt;&#948;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Here, a high-quality perovskite film with (111) preferred orientation ((111)-&lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) using a short-chain isomeric alcohol antisolvent, isopropanol (IPA) or isobutanol (IBA), is reported. The interaction between IPA and PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to a corner-sharing structure instead of an edge-sharing PbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; octahedron, sidestepping the formation of these intermediates. With the volatilization of IPA, FA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; can replace IPA in situ to form &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; along the (111) direction. Compared to randomly orientated perovskites, the dominantly (111) orientated perovskite ((111)-perovskite) exhibits improved carrier mobility, uniform surface potential, suppressed film defects and enhanced photostability. PSCs based on the (111)-perovskite films show 22% power conversion efficiency and excellent stability, which remains unchanged after 600&#160;h continuous working at maximum power point, and 95% after 2000&#160;h of storage in atmosphere environment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pollen&#8208;Inspired Adhesive Multilobe Microparticles from Microfluidics for Intestinal Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peony&#8208;pollen&#8208;inspired multilobe microparticles are designed for target surface adhesion and durable drug release via microfluidic electrospray technology and hydrogel selective degradation. By loading dexamethasone inside, these microparticles show excellent adhesion ability and anti&#8208;inflammatory property in treating rats with inflammatory bowel disease.








Abstract
Microparticles (MPs)&#8208;based delivery systems have a demonstrated value in gastrointestinal administration. Research in this area is focusing on the development of multifunctional MPs to improve delivery effects. Herein, learning from the natural morphology of peony pollens, novel multilobe MPs delivery systems for target surface adhesion and durable drug release are pesented. Ascribing to the flexibility of microfluidic technology and the combination of selective hydrogel degradation methods, MPs with a series of multilobe structures can be obtained using alginate and methacrylated gelatin. Compared with spherical MPs, these multilobe MPs are elucidated to show excellent adhesion capacity due to their enhanced contact area. By encapsulating anti&#8208;inflammatory agent dexamethasone (DXM) into their matrix hydrogel, the resultant multilobe MPs delivery systems are verified to feature durable drug&#8208;release property and anti&#8208;inflammatory efficacy, which is further demonstrated in rats with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicated that the biomimetic multilobe MPs are potentially ideal adhesive and durable drug&#8208;delivery vehicles for gastrointestinal drug administrations.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Solvation toward Low&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Temperature&#8208;Adaptive Feature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Salt precipitation is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS)&#8211;weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture. As a result, the solvation structure can transform at low temperature by spontaneous increase in entropy of the electrolyte, with a feature of temperature&#8208;adaption. This ensures a fast de&#8208;ionization process and stable co&#8208;intercalation process at low temperature.









Abstract
Salt precipitation at temperatures far above the freezing point of solvents is primarily responsible for performance decay of rechargeable batteries at low temperature, yet is still challenged by a lack of in&#8208;depth understanding of the design principle and ultimate solutions. Here, this is resolved via tuning the entropy of solvation in a strong&#8208;solvation (SS) and weak&#8208;solvation (WS) solvent mixture, in which a solvation structure can spontaneously transform at low temperature to avoid salt precipitation, endowing the electrolyte with a temperature&#8208;adaptive feature. The results affirm that such temperature&#8208;adaptive electrolyte ensures encouraging low&#8208;temperature performance in a hard carbon||Na2/3Ni1/4Cu1/12Mn2/3O2 full cell with 90.6% capacity retention over 400 cycles at &#8722;40&#8201;&#176;C. The generality of the concept is further expanded to construct a series of SS&#8211;WS electrolytes as potential candidates for rechargeable low&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The work shed lights on the importance of entropy tuning and affords a rational viewpoint on designing low&#8208;temperature electrolytes.

         <title>Precise Control of Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Nanolasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exceptional points (EPs) are employed&#160;&#160;in precisely tuning &#160; perovskite lasing actions. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a nanocavity, EPs periodically emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position: both the internal lasing actions and far&#8208;field radiation are completely reversed with a &lt;100 nm displacement. This research may find use in ultrasensitive position sensing.








Abstract
Efficient control of integrated light sources is crucial to advancing practical applications of nanophotonics. Despite the success of microlasers, their sophisticated nanostructures are not applicable in nanolasers. The situation for bottom&#8208;up&#8208;synthesized nanolasers becomes more challenging due to the constraints of fixed cavity shapes and fragile material stability. Here, the physics of exceptional points (EPs) is employed, and a strategy is demonstrated to precisely tune the lasing actions in lead halide perovskite nanorods. By placing a nanoparticle to the boundary of a square nanocavity, it is shown that EPs regularly and controllably emerge as a function of the nanoparticle position. Consequently, both the internal lasing actions and their far&#8208;field radiation can be completely reversed with a tiny displacement of &lt;100&#160;nm. The new strategy for controlling lasing actions in nanocavities is confirmed with numerical simulations and lasing experiments. This research can also bring new avenues for ultrasensitive position sensing.

         <title>Inhibition of Tumor Metastasis by Liquid&#8208;Nitrogen&#8208;Shocked Tumor Cells with Oncolytic Viruses Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling oncolytic virus delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The virus can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells; then, the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery.








Abstract
Despite the superior tumor lytic efficacy of oncolytic viruses (OVs), their systemic delivery still faces the challenges of limited circulating periods, poor tumor tropism, and spontaneous antiviral immune responses. Herein, a virus&#8208;concealed tumor&#8208;targeting strategy enabling OVs&#8216; delivery toward lung metastasis via systemic administration is described. The OVs can actively infect, be internalized, and cloak into tumor cells. Then the tumor cells are subsequently treated with liquid&#8208;nitrogen&#8208;shocking to eliminate the pathogenicity. Such a Trojan Horse&#8208;like vehicle avoids virus neutralization and clearance in the bloodstream and facilitates tumor&#8208;targeted delivery for more than 110&#8208;fold virus enrichment in the tumor metastasis. In addition, this strategy can serve as a tumor vaccine and initiate endogenous adaptive antitumor effects through increasing the memory T cells and modulating the tumor immune microenvironment, including reducing the M2 macrophage, downregulating Treg cells, and priming T cells.

         <title>Over 18% Efficiency of All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Long&#8208;Term Stability Enabled by Y6 as a Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) as a solid additive is introduced intoPM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 can remain inside the active layer and interact with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation, and decreased trap density in the Y6&#8208;processed blend result in a high efficiency over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h.








Abstract
Morphology control greatly influences the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and long&#8208;term stability of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs); however, it remains challenging owing to their complex crystallization behavior. Herein, a small amount of Y6 (2 wt%) is introduced as a solid additive into a PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. Y6 remained inside the active layer and interacted with PY&#8208;DT to form a well&#8208;mixed phase. Increased molecular packing, enlarged phase separation size, and decreased trap density are observed for the Y6&#8208;processed PM6:PY&#8208;DT blend. The corresponding devices showed simultaneously improved short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor, achieving a high PCE of over 18% and excellent long&#8208;term stability, with a T80 lifetime of 1180&#160;h and an extrapolated T70 lifetime of 9185&#160;h at maximum power point tracking (MPP) conditions under continuous one&#8208;sun illumination. This Y6&#8208;assisted strategy is successfully applied to other all&#8208;polymer blends, demonstrating its universality for all&#8208;PSCs. This work paves a new way for the fabrication of all&#8208;PSCs with high efficiency and superior long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Liquid Crystals for Advanced Smart Devices with Microwave and Millimeter&#8208;Wave Applications: Recent Progress for Next&#8208;generation Communications</title>

Abstract
Liquid crystals (LCs) technology have a well&#8208;established history of applications in visible light, particularly in the display industry. However, with the rapid growth in communication technology, LCs have become a topic of current interest for high&#8208;frequency microwave (MW) and millimeter&#8208;wave (mmWave) applications due to promising characteristics such as tunability, continuous tuning, low losses, and price compatibility. To improve the performance of future communication technology using LCs, it is not sufficient only with the perspective of radio&#8208;frequency (RF) technology. Therefore, it is imperative to understand not only the novel structural designs and optimization of MW engineering but also the perspective of materials engineering when implementing advanced RF devices with maximum performance for next&#8208;generation satellite and terrestrial communication. Herein, based on advanced nematic LCs, polymer&#8208;modified LCs, dual&#8208;frequency LCs, and photo&#8208;reactive LCs, this article summarizes and examines the modulation principles and key research directions for the design strategies of LCs for advanced smart RF devices with improved driving performance and novel functionality. Furthermore, the challenges in development of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art smart RF devices that use LCs are discussed.

         <title>Multifunctionality Through Embedding Patterned Nanostructures in High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite being one of the pillars of high&#8208;performance materials in the industry, manufacturing carbon fiber composites with concurrent maximized multifunctionality and structural properties has remained elusive primarily due to the lack of practical bottom&#8208;up approaches with control over nanoscale interactions. Herein, a programmable spray coating is introduced for the controlled deposition of multiple nanomaterials with tailorable patterns in composites. Guided by the droplet's internal currents, amphiphilicity of the building hybrid nanoparticles deposited on the interfacial region of the composite grants control over the specific surface area and bonding energy values at the atomic scale that results in disk or ring patterns. Controlling these patterns regulate the formation of interfaces, crack containment and damage, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity, which is lacking in conventional manufacturing with the random inclusion of nanoparticles. Molecular dynamics simulations show that increasing the share of cellulose nanocrystals in the hybrid nanomaterials, which is synchronous with shifting patterns from disk to ring, enhances the cohesion of the epoxy phase and improves the effective interactions between the two phases of carbon and in the interfacial region manifested in higher interlaminar and flexural strength. Transitioning from ring to disk creates a larger connected network manifested in higher thermal and electrical properties with no penalty on mechanical performance. This novel approach introduces a new bottom&#8208;up design paradigm, in which the mechanical and multifunctional performance is solely dependent on the shape of the deposited patterns in composites and thus eliminates the tradeoff between properties that are considered paradoxical in today's manufacturing of hierarchical composites

         <title>Efficient Therapy of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) with Highly Specific and Durable Targeted Ta2C Modified with Chondroitin Sulfate (TACS)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Non&#8208;invasive localization of lesions and specific targeted therapy are still the main challenges for inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Ta, as a medical metal element, has been widely used in the treatment of different diseases because of its excellent physicochemical properties, but is still far from being explored in IBD. Here, Ta2C modified with chondroitin sulfate (CS) (TACS) was evaluated as a highly targeted therapy nanomedicine for IBD. Specifically, TACS was modified with dual targeting CS functions due to IBD lesion&#8208;specific positive charges and high expression of CD44 receptor. Thanks to the acid stability, sensitive CT imaging function and strong ROS elimination ability, oral TACS can accurately locate and delineate IBD lesions through non&#8208;invasive CT imaging, and specifically targeted treat IBD effectively because high levels of ROS are a central factor in the progression of IBD. As expected, TACS has much better imaging and therapeutic effects than clinical CT contrast agent and first&#8208;line drug 5&#8208;aminosalicylic acid, respectively. The mechanism of TACS treatment mainly involves protection of mitochondria, elimination of oxidative stress, inhibiting macrophage M1 polarization, protection of intestinal barrier, and restoration of intestinal flora balance. Collectively, this work provides unprecedented opportunities for oral nanomedicines to targeted therapy of IBD.

         <title>Flexible Solution&#8208;Processable Black&#8208;Phosphorus&#8208;Based Optoelectronic Memristive Synapses for Neuromorphic Computing and Artificial Visual Perception Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Cu/HfOx/solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/Pt structure is designed and fabricated on a flexible Si substrate for neuromorphic computing and artificial visual perception. The device shows advanced synaptic features like long&#8208;term memory, short term memory, short&#8208;term potentiation, and learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when illuminated by visible light. A 6 &#215; 6 optoelectronic synapse array is constructed and used to mimic the human visual perception and visual memory functions.








Abstract
Being renowned for operating with visible&#8208;light pulses and electrical signals, optoelectronic memristive synaptic devices have excellent potential for neuromorphic computing systems and artificial visual information processing. Here, a flexible back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line&#8208;compatible optoelectronic memristor based on a solution&#8208;processable black phosphorus/HfOx bilayer with excellent synaptic features, toward biomimetic retinas is presented. The device shows highly stable synaptic features such as long&#8208;term potentiation (LTP) and long&#8208;term depression (LTD) for repetitive 1000 epochs, having 400 conductance pulses, each. The device presents advanced synaptic features in terms of long&#8208;term memory (LTM)/short term memory (STM), as well as learning&#8211;forgetting&#8211;relearning when visible light is induced on it. These advanced synaptic features can improve the information processing abilities for neuromorphic applications. Interestingly, the STM can be converted into LTM by adjusting the intensity of light and illumination time. Using the light&#8208;induced characteristics of the device, a 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6 synaptic array is developed to exhibit possible use in artificial visual perception. Moreover, the devices are flexed using a silicon back&#8208;etching process. The resulting flexible devices demonstrate stable synaptic features when bent down to 1&#160;cm radius. These multifunctional features in a single memristive cell make it highly suitable for optoelectronic memory storage, neuromorphic computing, and artificial visual perception applications.

With near&#8208;unity PLQY and negligible self&#8208;absorption, Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ exhibits excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation performance, including high light yield (64 950 photons MeV&#8722;1) and low detection limits (17.82 nGyair s&#8722;1). A flexible scintillator screen combining Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ and PDMS enables low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging with a high spatial resolution of 12.3 line pairs (lp) mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray scintillators with low detection limits and high light yield are of great importance and are a challenge for low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging in medical diagnosis and industrial detection. In this work, the synthesis of a new 2D perovskite, Cs2CdBr2Cl2, via hydrothermal reaction is reported. By doping Mn2+ into the perovskite, a yellow emission located at 593&#160;nm is obtained, and the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ perovskite reaches the highest value of 98.52%. The near&#8208;unity PLQY and negligible self&#8208;absorption of Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ enable excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation performance with a high light yield of 64 950 photons MeV&#8722;1 and low detection limit of 17.82 nGyair s&#8722;1. Moreover, combining Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ with poly(dimethylsiloxane) to fabricate a flexible scintillator screen achieves low&#8208;dose X&#8208;ray imaging with a high resolution of 12.3 line pairs (lp) mm&#8722;1. The results suggest that Cs2CdBr2Cl2:5%Mn2+ is a promising candidate for low&#8208;dose and high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging. The study presents a new approach to designing high&#8208;performance scintillators through metal&#8208;ion doping.

         <title>Incorporating Wireless Strategies to Wearable Devices Enabled by a Photocurable Hydrogel&#160;for Monitoring Pressure Information</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel photocurable hydrogel is developed to implement a two&#8208;in&#8208;one wearable device with a simple structure, which can quantify and visualize pressure simultaneously. Incorporated with wireless strategies, two integrated systems of smart patch and passive sensing are demonstrated, showing the potential for timely and on&#8208;site monitoring of physiological signals, and human&#8211;machine interfaces for various pressure information acquisition.








Abstract
Advances in emerging technologies for wireless collection and the timely analysis of various information captured by wearable devices are of growing interest. Herein, a crosslinked ionic hydrogel prepared by a facile photocuring process is proposed, which&#160;allows wearable devices to be further incorporated into two wireless integrated systems for pressure monitoring applications. The device exhibits a simplified structure by effectively sharing functional layers, rather than conventional two separate combinations, offering the salient performance of iontronic sensing and electrochromic properties to simultaneously quantify and visualize pressure. The developed smart patch system is demonstrated to monitor physiological signals in real&#8208;time utilizing the user interface of remote portable equipment with the Bluetooth protocol and on&#8208;site electrochromic displays. Moreover, a passive wireless system based on the magnetic coupling effect is designed, which can operate free from the battery and simultaneously acquire multiple pressure information. It is envisioned that the strategies would hold enormous potential for flexible electronics, versatile sensing platforms, and wireless on&#8208;body networks.

         <title>Strong Tough Thermogalvanic Hydrogel Thermocell With Extraordinarily High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermocells can continuously convert heat into electricity, and they are widely used to power wearable electronic devices. However, they have a risk of leakage and poor mechanical properties. Although quasi&#8208;solid ionic thermocells can overcome the issue of electrolyte leakage, the trade&#8208;off between their excellent mechanical properties and high thermopower remains a major challenge. In this study, we combine stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and the thermoelectric effect to propose a high&#8208;strength quasi&#8208;solid stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) with a large tensile strength of 19&#160;MPa and high thermopower of 6.5&#160;mV K&#8722;1. The SPTC exhibits a high stretchability of 1300%, ultrahigh toughness of 163.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and high specific output power density of 1969 &#956;W m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2. These comprehensive properties are superior to those of previously reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic thermocells. We demonstrate the use of SPTC&#8208;based systems in wearable devices for energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring. This can facilitate the rapid implementation of sustainable wearable electronics in the Internet of Things era.

Abstract
Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered cascade amplification of nanotherapies has attracted considerable attention as an effective strategy for cancer treatment. With the remarkable advances in materials chemistry and nanotechnology, a large number of well&#8208;designed nanosystems have emerged that incorporate presupposed cascade amplification processes and can be activated to trigger therapies such as chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and ferroptosis. under exogenous US stimulation or specific substances generated by US actuation, to maximize antitumor efficacy and minimize detrimental effects. Therefore, summarizing the corresponding nanotherapies and applications based on US&#8208;triggered cascade amplification is essential. This review comprehensively summarizes and highlights the recent advances in the design of intelligent modalities, consisting of unique components, distinctive properties, and specific cascade processes. These ingenious strategies confer unparalleled potential to nanotherapies based on ultrasound&#8208;triggered cascade amplification and provide superior controllability, thus overcoming the unmet requirements of precision medicine and personalized treatment. Finally, we discuss the challenges and prospects of this emerging strategy and expect to encourage more innovative ideas and promote their further development.

         <title>Generic Air&#8208;Gen Effect in Nanoporous Materials for Sustainable Energy Harvesting from Air Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generic effect in nanoporous thin&#8208;film materials for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity is reported. The charging process results from the dynamic air&#8208;water exchange at the porous interface and can be sustained over time.








Abstract
Air humidity is a vast, sustainable reservoir of energy that, unlike solar and wind, is continuously available. However, previously described technologies for harvesting energy from air humidity are either not continuous or require unique material synthesis or processing, which has stymied scalability and broad deployment. Here, a generic effect for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity is reported, which can be applied to a broad range of inorganic, organic, and biological materials. The common feature of these materials is that they are engineered with appropriate nanopores to allow air water to pass through and undergo dynamic adsorption&#8211;desorption exchange at the porous interface, resulting in surface charging. The top exposed interface experiences this dynamic interaction more than the bottom sealed interface in a thin&#8208;film device structure, yielding a spontaneous and sustained charging gradient for continuous electric output. Analyses of material properties and electric outputs lead to a &#8220;leaky capacitor&#8221; model that can describe how electricity is harvested and predict current behaviors consistent with experiments. Predictions from the model guide the fabrication of devices made from heterogeneous junctions of different materials to further expand the device category. The work opens a wide door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity from air.

Abstract
Patterning biomolecules in synthetic hydrogels offers routes to visualize and learn how spatially&#8208;encoded cues modulate cell behavior (e.g., proliferation, differentiation, migration, apoptosis). However, investigating the role of multiple, spatially defined biochemical cues within a single hydrogel matrix remains challenging because of the limited number of orthogonal bioconjugation reactions available for patterning. Herein, we introduce a method to pattern multiple oligonucleotide sequences in hydrogels using thiol&#8208;yne photochemistry. Rapid hydrogel photo&#8208;patterning of hydrogels with micron resolution DNA features (&#8764;1.5&#160;&#181;m) and control over DNA density are achieved over centimeter&#8208;scale areas using mask&#8208;free digital photolithography. Sequence&#8208;specific DNA interactions are then used to reversibly tether biomolecules to patterned regions, demonstrating chemical control over individual patterned domains. Finally, localized cell signaling is shown using patterned protein&#8208;DNA conjugates to selectively activate cells on patterned areas. Overall, this work introduces a synthetic method to achieve multiplexed micron&#8208;resolution patterns of biomolecules onto hydrogel scaffolds, providing a platform to study complex spatially encoded cellular signaling environments.

         <title>Engineering of Defective MOF&#8208;801 Nanostructures within Macroporous Spheres for Highly Efficient and Stable Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Water harvesting using the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;801 is restricted by limited working capacity, powder structuring, and finite stability. To overcome these issues, we&#160;crystallized MOF&#8208;801 on the surface of macroporous poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres, called P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA), through an in situ confined growth strategy, forming spherical MOF&#8208;801@P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA) composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. By lowering the nucleation energy barrier, the average size of the MOF&#8208;801 crystals decreased by 20 times. Thus, abundant defects as adsorption sites for water could&#160;be installed in the crystals lattices. As a consequence, the composite provides an unprecedented high water harvesting efficiency. The composite was&#160;produced in the kilogram&#8208;scale and can capture 1.60&#160;kg H2O/kg composite/day from 20% RH between 25&#176;C and 85&#176;C. This work provides an effective methodology for improving the adsorption capacity through controlled defects formation as adsorption sites and to improve the kinetics through the design of a composite with macroporous transport channel network.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, we&#160;propose an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimized the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V was&#160;obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintained 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrated high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10 &#215; 10 cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties have always been a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, w e have proposed a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane (PU&#8208;TA@MXene) film with a bionic Janus architecture, which wa s prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor wa s endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Implementing Logic Gates by DNA Crystal Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
DNA self&#8208;assembly computation is attractive for its potential to perform massively parallel information processing at the molecular level while at the same time maintaining its natural biocompatibility. It has been extensively studied at the individual molecule level, but not as much as ensembles in 3D. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of implementing logic gates, the basic computation operations, in large ensembles: macroscopic, engineered 3D DNA crystals. The building blocks are recently developed DNA double crossover&#8208;like (DXL) motifs. They can associate with each other via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. By encoding the inputs within the sticky ends of the motifs, we are able to realize common logic gates. The outputs are demonstrated through the formation of macroscopic crystals that can be easily observed. This study points to a new direction of construction of complex 3D crystal architectures and DNA&#8208;based biosensors with easy readouts.

         <title>Does Water&#8208;in&#8208;salt Electrolyte Subdue Issues of Zn Batteries?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Zn metal batteries (ZnBs) are safe and sustainable because of their operability in aqueous electrolytes, abundance and recyclability. However, the thermodynamic instability of Zn metal in aqueous electrolytes is a major bottleneck for its commercialisation. As such, Zn deposition (Zn2+ &#8594; Zn(s)) is continuously accompanied by hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) (2H+ &#8594; H2) and dendritic growth that further accentuates the HER. Consequently, the local pH around Zn electrode increases and promotes the formation of inactive and/or poorly conductive Zn passivation species (Zn + 2H2O &#8594; Zn(OH)2 + H2) on the Zn. This aggravates the consumption of Zn and electrolyte and degrades the performance of ZnB. To propel HER beyond its thermodynamic potential (0V vs. SHE at pH = 0), the concept of water&#8208;in&#8208;salt&#8208;electrolyte (WISE) has been employed in ZnBs. Since the publication of the first article on WISE for ZnB in 2016, this research area has progressed continuously. This research provides an overview on this topic and discusses the promising research directions for accelerating the maturity of ZnBs. This review briefly describes the current issues with conventional aqueous electrolyte in ZnBs, including a historic overview and basic understanding of WISE. Furthermore, this review details the application scenarios of WISE in ZnBs with the description of various key mechanisms (e.g., side reactions, Zn electrodeposition, anions or cations intercalation in metal oxide or graphite, ion transport at low temperature).

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, we report a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid (IBX), in which some nitrogen atoms were substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearranged the electronic structure of the oxidized carbon dots (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contributed to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also acted as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidized hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals were detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT were demonstrated.

         <title>A Sodium Alginate&#8208;Based Multifunctional Nanoplatform for Synergistic Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy of Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains a significant challenge due to the inherent limitations of traditional strategies. The exploration of polysaccharides&#8217; natural immunity for immunotherapy of HCC has been rarely explored. For this purpose, we reported in this study facile construction of a multifunctional nanoplatform, biotinylated aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (BEA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M) for synergistic chemo&#8208;immunotherapy by the use of constant &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;mannuronic acid (M) units and modulated &#945;&#8208;L&#8208;guluronic acid (G) units in the alginate (ALG) structure. The constant M units show natural immunity and specific binding ability with mannose receptor (MR) via strong receptor&#8208;ligand interactions, and the modulated G units serve as highly reactive conjugation sites for biotin (Bio) and DOX. This formulation not only integrates natural immunity of ALG and ICD triggering function of DOX, but also shows dual targeting properties to HCC cells via MR and Bio receptor (BR)&#8208;mediated endocytosis pathways. Notably, BEA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M at an equivalent dose of 3&#160;mg/kg of DOX mediated tumor inhibitory efficiency 12.10% and 4.70% higher than free DOX and aldehyde alginate&#8208;doxorubicin nano micelle (ASA&#8208;C = N&#8208;DOX&#8208;M), respectively, in Hepa1&#8208;6 tumor&#8208;bearing mice. This study reported the first example of integrating natural immunity of ALG and ICD effect of anticancer drugs for enhanced chemo&#8208;immunotherapy of HCC.

         <title>Tunable organic active neural probe enabling near&#8208;sensor signal processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neural recording systems have significantly progressed to provide an advanced understanding and treatment for neurological diseases. Flexible transistor&#8208;based active neural probes exhibit great potential in electrophysiology applications due to their intrinsic amplification capability and tissue&#8208;compliant nature. However, most current active neural probes exhibit bulky back&#8208;end connectivity since the output is current, and the development of an integrated circuit for voltage output is crucial for near&#8208;sensor signal processing at the abiotic/biotic interface. Here, we&#160;present inkjet&#8208;printed organic voltage amplifiers by monolithically integrating organic electrochemical transistors and thin&#8208;film polymer resistors on a single, highly flexible substrate for in vivo brain activity recording. Additive inkjet printing enables the seamless integration of multiple active and passive components on the somatosensory cortex, leading to significant noise reduction over the externally connected typical configuration. It also facilitates fine&#8208;tuning of the voltage amplification and frequency properties. We&#160;validate the organic voltage amplifiers as electrocorticography devices in a rat in vivo model, showing their ability to record local field potentials in an experimental model of spontaneous and epileptiform activity. Our&#160;results bring organic active neural probes to the forefront in applications where efficient sensory data processing is performed at sensor endpoints.

         <title>Enabling Highly Efficient and Thermal&#8208;stable Polymer Solar Cells through Semi&#8208;alloy Acceptors Composed of A Hinge&#8208;like Dimer: A Versatile Doping Protocol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The simultaneous improvement of power conversion efficiency (PCE) and thermal stability is a critical scientific challenge in advancing the commercial applications of polymer solar cells. To address this challenge, we successfully designed and synthesized a dumbbell&#8208;shaped dimeric acceptor, DT19, and incorporated it as a third component into the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9 system. This ternary strategy demonstrated a synergistic enhancement of the PCE and thermal stability of the host binary system. In particular, the PM1:BTP&#8208;eC9:DT19 system maintained a PCE of over 90% even after heating at 120&#176;C for 200 hours. Additionally, the dimer&#8208;doping ternary strategy exhibited excellent generality for the other four Y&#8208;series systems and outperformed ternary systems containing alloy&#8208;like acceptors in terms of thermal stability. It is because DT19, with its hinge&#8208;like structure, can form a semi&#8208;alloy acceptor with the host acceptor, leading to strong interchain entanglement with the polymer donor, thus overcoming phase separation and excessive aggregation under thermal stress. This new type of dimeric material, which can synergistically enhance the device efficiency and thermal stability of active layers, presents promising application prospects.

         <title>An Isomeric Solid Additive Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Polymer Solar Cells Developed Using a Benzo&#8208;Difuran&#8208;Based Donor Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of benzo&#8208;difuran&#8208;based polymer&#8208;donor&#8208;enabled solar cells is improved a lot in this work thanks to rational material combination and isomeric solid additive type morphology tuning. A series of characterizations, in situ technique, vertical distribution calculation, transient absorption spectra, and GIWAXS/SAXS + RSoXS, reveal the basic mechanism, producing fruitful insights to this work with record efficiency.








Abstract
Currently, nearly all high&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic devices use donor polymers based on the benzo&#8208;dithiophene (BDT) unit. To diversify the choices of building blocks for high&#8208;performance donor polymers, the use of benzo&#8208;difuran (BDF) units is explored, which can achieve reduced steric hindrance, stronger molecular packing, and tunable energy levels. In previous research, the performance of BDF&#8208;based devices lagged behind those of BDT&#8208;based devices. In this study, a high efficiency (18.4%) is achieved using a BDF&#8208;based polymer donor, which is the highest efficiency reported for BDF donor materials to date. The high efficiency is enabled by a donor polymer (D18&#8208;Fu) and the aid of a solid additive (2&#8208;chloronaphthalene), which is the isomer of the commonly used additive 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene. These results revealed the significant effect of 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene in optimizing the morphology and enhancing the device parameters. This work not only provides a new building block that can achieve an efficiency comparable to dominant BDT units but also proposes a new solid additive that can replace the widely used 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene additive.

         <title>Fluorescence&#8208;Amplified Origami Microneedle Device for Quantitatively Monitoring Blood Glucose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA&#8208;origami nanotubes, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical deformation of the DNA&#8208;origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real&#8208;time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.








Abstract
Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence&#8208;amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA&#8208;origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin&#8208;attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton&#8208;driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA&#8208;origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose&#8208;correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well&#8208;matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.

&lt;p&gt;Through collaboratively integrating a microneedle patch and DNA-origami nanotubes, a fluorescence-amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device enables the conversion from glucose to a proton signal. The proton-driven mechanical deformation of the DNA-origami structure leads to the fluorescence signal recovery. The FAOM device combines quantitative, accurate, trivially painful, and highly sensitive characteristics for real-time monitoring of blood glucose, thus improving test tolerance and patient's compliance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exploration of clinically acceptable blood glucose monitors has been engaging in the past decades, yet the ability to quantitatively detect blood glucose in a painless, accurate, and highly sensitive manner remains limited. Herein, a fluorescence-amplified origami microneedle (FAOM) device is described that integrates tubular DNA-origami nanostructures and glucose oxidase molecules into its inner network to quantitatively monitor blood glucose. The skin-attached FAOM device can collect glucose molecules in situ and transfer the input into a proton signal after the oxidase's catalysis. The proton-driven mechanical reconfiguration of DNA-origami tubes separates fluorescent molecules and their quenchers, eventually amplifying the glucose-correlated fluorescence signal. The function equation established on clinical examinees suggests that FAOM can report blood glucose in a highly sensitive and quantitative manner. In clinical blind tests, the FAOM achieves well-matched accuracy (98.70&#160;&#177;&#160;4.77%) compared with a commercial blood biochemical analyzer, fully meeting the requirements of accurate blood glucose monitoring. The FAOM device can be inserted into skin tissue in a trivially painful manner and with minimal leakage of DNA origami, substantially improving the tolerance and compliance of the blood glucose test.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ordering&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution and Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis of High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ordering transformation of high&#8208;entropy Pt4FeCoNiCu nanoparticles from disordered solid&#8208;solution alloy to ordered intermetallic structure is demonstrated across multiple scales. The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activities are revealed to be ordering&#8208;dependent, and the highly ordered Pt4FeCoNiCu outperforms most other Pt&#8208;based catalysts for HER and ORR with robust durability.








Abstract
Disordered solid&#8208;solution high&#8208;entropy alloys have attracted wide research attention as robust electrocatalysts. In comparison, ordered high&#8208;entropy intermetallics have been hardly explored and the effects of the degree of chemical ordering on catalytic activity remain unknown. In this study, a series of multicomponent intermetallic Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles with tunable ordering degrees is fabricated. The transformation mechanism of the multicomponent nanoparticles from disordered structure into ordered structure is revealed at the single&#8208;particle level, and it agrees with macroscopic analysis by selected&#8208;area electron diffraction and X&#8208;ray diffraction. The electrocatalytic performance of Pt4FeCoCuNi nanoparticles correlates well with their crystal structure and electronic structure. It is found that increasing the degree of ordering promotes electrocatalytic performance. The highly ordered Pt4FeCoCuNi achieves the highest mass activities toward both acidic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) which are 18.9&#8208;fold and 5.6&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively. The experiment also shows that this catalyst demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability than both partially ordered and disordered Pt4FeCoCuNi as well as Pt/C when subject to both HER and ORR. This ordering&#8208;dependent structure&#8211;property relationship provides insight into the rational design of catalysts and stimulates the exploration of many other multicomponent intermetallic alloys.

         <title>Recent Advances in Carbon Nanotube&#8208;Based Energy Harvesting Technologies</title>

Abstract
There has been enormous interest in technologies that generate electricity from ambient energy such as solar, thermal, and mechanical energy, due to their potential for providing sustainable solutions to the energy crisis. One driving force behind the search for new energy&#8208;harvesting technologies is the desire to power sensor networks and portable devices without batteries, such as self&#8208;powered wearable electronics, human health monitoring systems, and implantable wireless sensors. Various energy harvesting technologies have been demonstrated in recent years. Among them, electrochemical, hydroelectric, triboelectric, piezoelectric, and thermoelectric nanogenerators have been extensively studied because of their special physical properties, ease of application, and sometimes high obtainable efficiency. Multifunctional carbon nanotubes (CNTs) have attracted much interest in energy harvesting because of their exceptionally high gravimetric power outputs and recently obtained high energy conversion efficiencies. Further development of this field, however, still requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of harvesting mechanisms and boosting of the electrical outputs for wider applications. We here comprehensively review various CNT&#8208;based energy harvesting technologies, focusing on working principles, typical examples, and future improvements. The last section discusses the existing challenges and future directions of CNT&#8208;based energy harvesters.

         <title>Palladium&#8208;Percolated Networks Enabled by Low Loadings of Branched Nanorods for Enhanced H2 Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanorods with suitable aspect ratios are ideal for constructing percolated networks in polymers with low loadings and easiness to fabricate defect&#8208;free membranes, compared with nanoparticles and nanowires. This work demonstrates mixed matrix materials containing Pd&#8208;percolated networks enabled by 3.9&#160;vol% Pd branched nanorods, achieving H2/CO2 separation properties superior to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membrane materials and surpassing the upper bound.








Abstract
Nanoparticles (NPs) at high loadings are often used in mixed matrix membranes (MMMs) to improve gas separation properties, but they can lead to defects and poor processability that impede membrane fabrication. Herein, it is demonstrated that branched nanorods (NRs) with controlled aspect ratios can significantly reduce the required loading to achieve superior gas separation properties while maintaining excellent processability, as demonstrated by the dispersion of palladium (Pd) NRs in polybenzimidazole for H2/CO2 separation. Increasing the aspect ratio from 1 for NPs to 40 for NRs decreases the percolation threshold volume fraction by a factor of 30, from 0.35 to 0.011. An MMM with percolated networks formed by Pd NRs at a volume fraction of 0.039 exhibits H2 permeability of 110&#160;Barrer and H2/CO2 selectivity of 31 when challenged with simulated syngas at 200&#160;&#176;C, surpassing Robeson's upper bound. This work highlights the advantage of NRs over NPs and nanowires and shows that right&#8208;sizing nanofillers in MMMs is critical to construct highly sieving pathways at minimal loadings. This work paves the way for this general feature to be applied across materials systems for a variety of chemical separations.

Abstract
Catalysts with designable intelligent nanostructure may potentially drive the changes of chemical reaction techniques. Herein, we designed a multi&#8208;function integrating nanocatalyst, Pt&#8208;containing magnetic yolk&#8208;shell carbonaceous structure, having catalysis function, microenvironment heating, thermal&#160;insulation and elevated pressure into a whole, which induces selective hydrogenation within heating&#8208;constrained nanoreactors surrounded by ambient environment.&#160;As a demonstration, carbonyl of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols with a &gt;98% selectivity at a nearly complete conversion under mild conditions of 40&#160;&#176;C and 3&#160;bar instead of harsh requirements of 120&#160;&#176;C and 30&#160;bar. We creatively demonstrate that the locally increased temperature and endogenous pressure (estimated as &#8764;120&#160;&#176;C, 9.7&#160;bar) in the nano&#8208;sized space greatly facilitates the reaction kinetics under an alternating magnetic field. The outward&#8208;diffused products to the &#8220;cool environment&#8221; retain thermodynamically stable, avoiding the over&#8208;hydrogenation often occurs under constantly heated conditions of 120&#160;&#176;C. Regulation of the electronic state of Pt by sulfur doping of carbon allows selective chemical adsorption of the &#8208;C = O group and consequently leads to selective hydrogenation. It is expected that such a multi&#8208;function integrated catalyst provides an ideal platform for precisely operating a variety of organic liquid&#8208;phase transformations under mild reaction conditions.

The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane with more uniform pores is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel (just like a molecular highway) constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface. The formed COF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, strong chemical stability, and sufficient flexibility.








Abstract
Highly flexible and robust self&#8208;standing covalent organic framework (COF) membranes with rapid preparation are important but technically challenging for achieving precise separation. Herein , a novel imine&#8208;based 2D soft covalent organic framework (SCOF) membrane with a large area of 226.9&#160;cm2, via ingeniously selecting an aldehyde flexible linker and a trigonal building block, is reported. The soft 2D covalent organic framework membrane is rapidly formed (&#8776;5&#160;min) based on the sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) molecular channel constructed at the water/dichloromethane (DCM) interface, which is the record&#8208;fast SCOF membrane formation and 72 times faster than that in the reported literature. MD simulation and DFT calculation elucidate that the dynamic, self&#8208;assembled SDS molecular channel facilitates faster and more homogeneous transfer of amine monomers in the bulk, thereby forming a soft 2D self&#8208;standing COF membrane with more uniform pores. The formed SCOF membrane exhibits superb sieving capability for small molecules, robustness in strong alkaline (5&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 NaOH), acid (0.1&#160;mol&#160;L&#8722;1 HCl), and various organic solutions, and sufficient flexibility with a large curvature of 2000&#160;m&#8722;1 for membrane&#8208;based separation science and technology.

         <title>Achieving Highly Proton&#8208;Resistant Zn&#8208;Pb Anode through Low Hydrogen Affinity and Strong Bonding for Long&#8208;Life Electrolytic Zn//MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
High&#8208;energy electrolytic Zn//MnO2 batteries show potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) caused by acidic electrolytes results in subdued durability. Here, we report an all&#8208;around protection strategy for achieving stable metal Zn anode. Firstly, a proton&#8208;resistant Pb&#8208;containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which will in&#8208;situ form PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protect the Zn substrate from HEC. Secondly, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 additive (denoted as Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad) is introduced, which will convert to PbSO4 precipitation and release trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit Pb layer on Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+ as well as strong bonding between Pb&#8208;Zn or Pb&#8208;Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier. Consequently, the Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad//MnO2 battery runs stably for 630 and 795&#160;h in 0.2 and 0.1&#160;M H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, which are &gt;40 times than that of bare Zn. The as&#8208;prepared A h&#8208;level battery achieves the one&#8208;month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high&#8208;durable grid&#8208;scale Zn batteries.

Here, we report an all-around protection strategy for achieving stable metal Zn anode. Firstly, a proton-resistant Pb-containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which will in-situ form PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protect the Zn substrate from HEC. Secondly, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 additive (denoted as Zn@Pb-Ad) is introduced, which will convert to PbSO4 precipitation and release trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit Pb layer on Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+ as well as strong bonding between Pb-Zn or Pb-Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Biased Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is characterized by a dissipationless chiral edge state with a quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Manipulating the QAH state is of great importance in both the understanding of topological quantum physics and the implementation of dissipationless electronics. Here, we realized the QAH effect in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (CBST) grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. Through polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR), we find a strong exchange coupling between CBST and Al&#8208;Cr2O3 surface spins fixing interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular to the film plane. The interfacial coupling results in an exchange&#8208;biased QAH effect. We further demonstrate that the magnitude and sign of the exchange bias can be effectively controlled using a field training process to set the magnetization of the Al&#8208;Cr2O3 layer. Our work demonstrates the use of the exchange bias effect to effectively manipulate the QAH state, opening new possibilities in QAH&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>As&#8208;grown Miniaturized True Zero&#8208;order Waveplates Based on Low&#8208;dimensional Ferrocene Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As basic optical elements, waveplates with anisotropic electromagnetic responses are imperative for manipulating light polarization. Conventional waveplates are manufactured from bulk crystals (e.g., quartz and calcite) through a series of precision cutting and grinding steps, which typically result in large size, low yield, and high cost. In this study, we use a bottom&#8208;up method to grow ferrocene crystals with large anisotropy to demonstrate self&#8208;assembled ultrathin true zero&#8208;order waveplates without additional machining processing, which is particularly suited for nanophotonic integration. The van der Waals ferrocene crystals exhibit high birefringence (&#916;n (experiment) = 0.149&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.002 at 636&#160;nm), low dichroism &#916;&#954; (experiment) = &#8208;0.0007 at 636&#160;nm), and a potentially broad operating range (550&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#956;m) as suggested by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the grown waveplate's highest and the lowest principal axes (n1 and n3, respectively) are in the a&#8208;c plane, where the fast axis is along one natural edge of the ferrocene crystal, rendering them readily usable. The as&#8208;grown, wavelength&#8208;scale&#8208;thick waveplate allows the development of further miniaturized systems via tandem integration.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nano&#8208;Islands (SANIs): A Robust Atomic&#8211;Nano System for Versatile Heterogeneous Catalysis Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs) is proposed for materials science and catalysis science, and their synthetic breakthrough, scientific significances, and potential applications are systematically summarized.








Abstract
Academician Tao Zhang from China and co&#8208;workers designed the first Pt1/FeOx single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) in 2011, and they proposed the concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom catalysis&#8221; in the field of heterogeneous catalysis. Generally, it is easy for&#160;active metal single&#8208;atom sites on a carrier to migrate and aggregate, which results in poor performance; or the chemical bond between the metal atom and carrier is too strong (immovable), which results in passivation of the active site. Recently, &#8220;nano&#8208;island&#8221; type SACs&#160;were&#160;designed, in which the active metal atoms are isolated on the &#8220;islands&#8221;, and can move within the respective &#8220;island&#8221;, but the migration across the &#8220;island&#8221; is blocked, to achieve a dynamic confinement design of single atoms (that is, a &#8220;moving but not aggregating&#8221; design philosophy). Herein, a new concept of &#8220;single&#8208;atom nano&#8208;islands (SANIs)&#8221; is proposed to describe these congeneric &#8220;atomic&#8211;nano&#8221;&#160;systems in heterogeneous catalysis fields. Particularly, the SANIs are divided into three categories: &#8220;one&#8208;island&#8211;one&#8208;atom&#8221;, &#8220;one&#8208;island&#8211;multi&#8208;atoms&#8221;, and &#8220;island&#8211;sea synergism&#8221; architectures. The scientific significance and application principles of SANIs in versatile heterogeneous catalysis fields (i.e., thermocatalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis) are summarized. The challenges and proposals of SANIs are also provided.

         <title>Coupled Tamm Phonon and Plasmon Polaritons for Designer Planar Multiresonance Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tamm phonon and plasmon polaritons supported by distributed Bragg reflectors with phonon polariton materials and plasmonic materials are coupled to form Tamm hybrid polaritons (THPs). Here, it is demonstrated that THPs exhibit improved quality&#8208;factors and smaller angular dispersion compared to bare Tamm plasmon polaritons, which are advantageous for many applications such as free&#8208;space communications and gas sensing.








Abstract
Wavelength&#8208;selective absorbers (WS&#8208;absorbers) are of interest for various applications, including chemical sensing and light sources. Lithography&#8208;free fabrication of WS&#8208;absorbers can be realized via Tamm plasmon polaritons (TPPs) supported by distributed Bragg reflectors (DBRs) on plasmonic materials. While multifrequency and nearly arbitrary spectra can be realized with TPPs via inverse design algorithms, demanding and thick DBRs are required for high quality&#8208;factors (Q&#8208;factors) and/or multiband TPP&#8208;absorbers, increasing the cost and reducing fabrication error tolerance. Here, high Q&#8208;factor multiband absorption with limited DBR layers (3 layers) is experimentally demonstrated by Tamm hybrid polaritons (THPs) formed by coupling TPPs and Tamm phonon polaritons when modal frequencies are overlapped. Compared to the TPP component, the Q&#8208;factors of THPs are improved twofold, and the angular broadening is also reduced twofold, facilitating applications where narrow&#8208;band and nondispersive WS&#8208;absorbers are needed. Moreover, an open&#8208;source algorithm is developed to inversely design THP&#8208;absorbers consisting of anisotropic media and exemplify that the modal frequencies can be assigned to desirable positions. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that inversely designed THP&#8208;absorbers can realize same spectral resonances with fewer DBR layers than a TPP&#8208;absorber, thus reducing the fabrication complexity and enabling more cost&#8208;effective, lithography&#8208;free, wafer&#8208;scale WS&#8208;absorberss for applications such as free&#8208;space communications and gas sensing.

         <title>In Situ Transformable Nanoplatforms with Supramolecular Cross&#8208;Linking Triggered Complementary Function for Enhanced Cancer Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide&#8208;based nanoplatform with transformable cross&#8208;links based on supramolecular coordination between polyhydroxy photosensitizer and metal ion under tumor microenvironment trigger for enhanced cancer photodynamic therapy is reported. This strategy provides a new concept which pursues to amplify the functions of each component under internal or external stimulation and jointly realize the enhanced therapy effect.








Abstract
In vivo cross&#8208;linking of nanoparticles is widely used to increase accumulation of therapeutic agents at tumor site for enhanced therapy. However, the components in nanoplatforms usually only play for one role and are independent of each other, unable to amplify their biofunctions. Herein, a complementary functioning tumor microenvironment triggered, supramolecular coordination&#8208;induced nanoparticle cross&#8208;linking strategy is constructed for enhanced photodynamic therapy. Manganese oxide (MnOx) and polyhydroxy photosensitizer hypericin (Hyp) are coated and loaded onto lanthanide&#8208;doped upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) to form transformable UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp. In CT26&#160;mouse colon cancer cells and xenograft tumors, UCNP@MnOx&#8208;Hyp is reduced by glutathione and H2O2, releasing Mn2+ and Hyp for in situ cross&#8208;linking to transform to UCNP@Mn2+&#8208;Hyp. Compared to the simple photosensitizer&#8208;loaded UCNP@PEI&#8208;Hyp, the Mn2+&#8208;Hyp coordination redshifts absorbance of Hyp and improves the energy transfer efficiency from UCNPs to Hyp (5.6&#8208;fold). In turn, the supramolecular coordination&#8208;induced UCNPs cross&#8208;linking exhibits enhanced luminescence recovery and increased intracellular accumulation of both UCNPs and Hyp, thus enhancing the photodynamic therapy efficacy both at cellular level (2.1&#8208;fold) and in vivo, realizing the function amplification of each component after responsive transformation and offering a new avenue for enhanced cancer therapy.

         <title>Phage Display Screening as a Rational Approach to Design Additives for Selective Crystallization Control in Construction Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phage display screening reveals the amino acid triplet DYH as a unique chemical entity for strong binding on gypsum surfaces. Peptides based on this motif provide strictly selective control over crystallization in reactive cementitious systems and can be translated into scalable synthetic copolymers.








Abstract
The design of additives showing strong and selective interactions with certain target surfaces is key to crystallization control in applied reactive multicomponent systems. While suitable chemical motifs can be found through semi&#8208;empirical trial&#8208;and&#8208;error procedures, bioinspired selection techniques offer a more rationally driven approach and explore a much larger space of possible combinations in a single assay. Here, phage display screening is used to characterize the surfaces of crystalline gypsum, a mineral of broad relevance for construction applications. Based on next&#8208;generation sequencing of phages enriched during the screening process, a triplet of amino acids, DYH, is identified as the main driver for adsorption on the mineral substrate. Furthermore, oligopeptides containing this motif prove to exert their influence in a strictly selective manner during the hydration of cement, where the sulfate reaction (initial setting) is strongly retarded while the silicate reaction (final hardening) remains unaffected. In the final step, these desired additive characteristics are successfully translated from the level of peptides to that of scalable synthetic copolymers. The approach described in this work demonstrates how modern biotechnological methods can be leveraged for the systematic development of efficient crystallization additives for materials science.

         <title>Regulating Inorganic and Organic Components to Build Amorphous&#8208;ZnFx Enriched Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase for Highly Reversible Zn Metal Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile bisolvent&#8208;electrolyte engineering is developed to realize improved reversibility of zinc metal anode with an accumulated capacity remarkably reaching 5600 mAh cm&#8722;2. A highly fluorinated solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed with amorphous zinc fluorides (ZnFx)&#8208;enriched and the interphasial chemistry is resolved by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy.








Abstract
The introduction of inorganic crystallites into a solid&#8211;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is an effective strategy for improving the reversibility of the Zn metal anode (ZMA). However, the structure&#8211;performance relationship of the SEI is not fully understood because the existing forms of its inorganic and organic components in their pristine states are not resolved. Here, a highly effective SEI is constructed for ZMA using a bisolvent electrolyte and resolved its composition/structure by cryogenic transmission electron microscopy. This highly fluorinated SEI with amorphous inorganic ZnFx uniformly distributed in the organic matrix is largely different from the common mosaic and multilayer SEIs with crystalline inorganics. It features improved structural integrity, mechanical toughness, and Zn2+ ion conductivity. Consequently, the ZMA exhibits excellent reversibility with an enhanced plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.8%. The ZMA&#8208;based full cell achieves a high Zn utilization ratio of 54% at a practical areal capacity of 3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling over 1800&#160;h during which the accumulated capacity reached 5600&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2. This research highlights the detailed structure and composition of amorphous SEIs for highly reversible metal anodes.

         <title>Printable Perovskite Diodes for Broad&#8208;Spectrum Multienergy X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Both soft and hard X&#8208;ray regimes provide important spectroscopic prospects toward understanding complex heterogenous objects. Here, it is showcased that Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskites within an n&#8208;i&#8208;p configuration can effectively absorb X&#8208;rays across both regimes due to their high attenuation coefficients.

Multienergy X&#8208;ray detection is critical to effectively differentiate materials in a variety of diagnostic radiology and nondestructive testing applications. Silicon and selenium X&#8208;ray detectors are the most common for multienergy detection; however, these present poor energy discrimination across the broad X&#8208;ray spectrum and exhibit limited spatial resolution due to the high thicknesses required for radiation attenuation. Here, an X&#8208;ray detector based on solution&#8208;processed thin&#8208;film metal halide perovskite that overcomes these challenges is introduced. By harnessing an optimized n&#8208;i&#8208;p diode configuration, operation is achieved across a broad range of soft and hard X&#8208;ray energies stemming from 0.1 to 10's of keV. Through detailed experimental and simulation work, it is shown that optimized Cs0.1FA0.9PbI3 perovskites effectively attenuate soft and hard X&#8208;rays, while also possessing excellent electrical properties to result in X&#8208;ray detectors with high sensitivity factors that exceed 5 &#215; 103 &#181;C&#8201;GyVac&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2$\mu {\rm{C}}\;{{\bf Gy}}_{{\rm{Vac}}}^{ - 1}\;{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}$ and 6 &#215; 104 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 within soft and hard X&#8208;ray regimes, respectively. Harnessing the solution&#8208;processable nature of the perovskites, roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printable X&#8208;ray detectors on flexible substrates are also demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;Both soft and hard X-ray regimes provide important spectroscopic prospects toward understanding complex heterogenous objects. Here, it is showcased that Cs&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.9&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; perovskites within an n-i-p configuration can effectively absorb X-rays across both regimes due to their high attenuation coefficients. It is anticipated that these printable, scalable, and flexible devices can provide a step-jump for imaging applications requiring broad-spectrum multienergy X-ray detection.

         <title>Tough, Recyclable, and Degradable Elastomers for Potential Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To achieve sustainable development, the preparation of novel elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable is highly desirable. In this work, a polycaprolactone&#8208;based polyurethane elastomer is carefully designed and developed with excellent mechanical properties and biocompatibility, which shows great potential for biomedical applications.








Abstract
Elastomers have many industrial, medical and commercial applications, however, their huge demand raises an important question of how to dispose of the out&#8208;of&#8208;service elastomers. Ideal elastomers that are concurrently tough, recyclable, and degradable are in urgent need, but their preparation remains a rigorous challenge. Herein, a polycaprolactone (PCL) based polyurethane elastomer is designed and prepared to meet this demand. Owing to the presence of dynamic coordination bond and the occurrence of strain&#8208;induced crystallization, the obtained elastomer exhibits a high toughness of &#8776;372&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and an unprecedented fracture energy of &#8776;646&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2, which is much higher than natural rubber (&#8776;50&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 for toughness and &#8776;10&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;2 for fracture energy). In addition, the elastomer can be recycled at least three times using solvent without losing its mechanical properties and can be degraded by lipase in &#8776;2 months. Finally, biological experiments demonstrate that the elastomer possesses good biocompatibility and can facilitate wound healing in mice when used as sutures. It is believed that the obtained elastomer meets the requirements for next&#8208;generation elastomers and is expected to be used in emerging fields such as biomedicine, flexible electronics, robotics and beyond.

         <title>Toward High Conversion Efficiency of Thermoelectric Modules through Synergistical Optimization of Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistical optimization of layered architecture on half&#8208;Heusler alloys is demonstrated for high conversion efficiency thermoelectric power generation applications. The (Nb, Hf)FeSb alloy exhibits a superior figure of merit of 1.5 at 973 K. A comprehensive coupling of the thermoelectric parameters with temperature gradient is realized, and a remarkable conversion efficiency of &#8776;15% is achieved under &#916;T of 670 K.








Abstract
Waste&#8208;heat electricity generation using high&#8208;efficiency solid&#8208;state conversion technology can significantly decrease dependence on fossil fuels. Here, a synergistical optimization of layered half&#8208;Heusler (hH) materials and module to improve thermoelectric conversion efficiency is reported. This is realized by manufacturing multiple thermoelectric materials with major compositional variations and temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled carrier distribution by one&#8208;step spark plasma sintering. This strategy provides a solution to overcome the intrinsic concomitants of the conventional segmented architecture that only considers the matching of the figure of merit (zT) with the temperature gradient. The current design is dedicated to temperature&#8208;gradient&#8208;coupled resistivity and compatibility matching, optimum zT matching, and reducing contact resistance sources. By enhancing the quality factor of the materials by Sb&#8208;vapor&#8208;pressure&#8208;induced annealing, a superior zT of 1.47 at 973 K is achieved for (Nb, Hf)FeSb hH alloys. Along with the low&#8208;temperature high&#8208;zT hH alloys of (Nb, Ta, Ti, V)FeSb, the single stage layered hH modules are developed with efficiencies of &#8776;15.2% and &#8776;13.5% for the single&#8208;leg and unicouple thermoelectric modules, respectively, under &#916;T of 670 K. Therefore, this work has a transformative impact on the design and development of next&#8208;generation thermoelectric generators for any thermoelectric material families.

Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. Simultaneous activation of pro&#8208;apoptotic autophagy and apoptotic signaling pathways is a novel strategy for the treatment of solid liver tumors. Here, the amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione&#8208;gold nanoclusters with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the endoplasmic reticulum can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis.








Abstract
Apoptosis and autophagy determine the fate of cancer cells. However, simply promoting apoptosis of tumor cells is limited in the treatment of unresectable solid liver tumors. Generally, autophagy is considered the anti&#8208;apoptotic &#8220;guardian&#8221;. But the pro&#8208;apoptotic effects of autophagy can be activated by excessive endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Here, amphiphilic peptide&#8208;modified glutathione (GSH)&#8208;gold nanocluster aggregates (AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs)&#160;were&#160;designed with the enrichment of solid liver tumors and the prolonged stress in the ER, which can achieve the mutual promotion of autophagy and apoptosis in liver tumor cells. In this study, orthotopic and subcutaneous liver tumor models show the anti&#8208;tumor effectiveness of AP1P2&#8208;PEG NCs, with a better antitumor effect than sorafenib, biosafety (Lethal Dose, 50% (LD50) of 827.3&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1), wide therapeutic window (non&#8208;toxic in 20 times of therapeutic concentration) and high stability (blood half&#8208;life of 4&#160;h). These findings identify an effective strategy to develop peptide&#8208;modified gold nanocluster aggregates with low toxicity, high potency, and selectivity for solid liver tumors treatment.

         <title>Formation Mechanism of Elemental Te Produced in Tellurite Glass Systems by Femtosecond Laser Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of Te nanocrystals and nanoparticles generated in tellurite glass by ultrafast laser processing is unveiled. The laser direct&#8208;write technology leads to controllable Te/TeO2 nanocomposite production without adding or subtracting other materials through a single&#8208;step process.








Abstract
The formation of elemental trigonal tellurium (t&#8208;Te) on tellurite glass surfaces exposed to femtosecond&#160;laser pulses is discussed. Specifically, the underlying elemental crystallization phenomenon is investigated by altering laser parameters in common tellurite glass compositions under various ambient conditions. Elemental crystallization of t&#8208;Te by a single femtosecond laser pulse is unveiled by high&#8208;resolution imaging and analysis. The thermal diffusion model reveals the absence of lattice melting upon a single laser pulse, highlighting the complexity of the phase transformation.

     alt="Formation Mechanism of Elemental Te Produced in Tellurite Glass Systems by Femtosecond Laser Irradiation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation mechanism of Te nanocrystals and nanoparticles generated in tellurite glass by ultrafast laser processing is unveiled. The laser direct-write technology leads to controllable Te/TeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; nanocomposite production without adding or subtracting other materials through a single-step process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The formation of elemental trigonal tellurium (t-Te) on tellurite glass surfaces exposed to femtosecond&#160;laser pulses is discussed. Specifically, the underlying elemental crystallization phenomenon is investigated by altering laser parameters in common tellurite glass compositions under various ambient conditions. Elemental crystallization of t-Te by a single femtosecond laser pulse is unveiled by high-resolution imaging and analysis. The thermal diffusion model reveals the absence of lattice melting upon a single laser pulse, highlighting the complexity of the phase transformation. The typical cross-section displays three different crystal configurations over its depth, in which the overall thickness increases with each subsequent pulse. The effect of various controlled atmospheres shows the suppressing nature of the elemental crystallization, whereas the substrate temperature shows no significant impact on the nucleation of t-Te nanocrystals. This research gives new insight into the elemental crystallization of glass upon femtosecond laser irradiation and shows the potential to fabricate functional transparent electronic micro/nanodevices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Silk Fibroin and Sericin Differentially Potentiate the Paracrine and Regenerative Functions of Stem Cells Through Multiomics Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, potentiate the paracrine functions of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) by differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. The SF&#8208; and SS&#8208;initiated paracrine signals of MSCs modulate the behaviors of multiple resident cells in the skin wound microenvironments and thereby improve skin regeneration with structural and functional recovery.








Abstract
Silk fibroin (SF) and sericin (SS), the two major proteins of silk, are attractive biomaterials with great potential in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. However, their biochemical interactions with stem cells remain unclear. In this study, multiomics are employed to obtain a global view of the cellular processes and pathways of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) triggered by SF and SS to discern cell&#8211;biomaterial interactions at an in&#8208;depth, high&#8208;throughput molecular level. Integrated RNA sequencing and proteomic analysis confirm that SF and SS initiate widespread but distinct cellular responses and potentiate the paracrine functions of MSCs that regulate extracellular matrix deposition, angiogenesis, and immunomodulation through differentially activating the integrin/PI3K/Akt and glycolysis signaling pathways. These paracrine signals of MSCs stimulated by SF and SS effectively improve skin regeneration by regulating the behavior of multiple resident cells (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, and macrophages) in the skin wound microenvironment. Compared to SS, SF exhibits better immunomodulatory effects in vitro and in vivo, indicating its greater potential as a carrier material of MSCs for skin regeneration. This study provides comprehensive and reliable insights into the cellular interactions with SF and SS, enabling the future development of silk&#8208;based therapeutics for tissue engineering and stem cell therapy.

         <title>True Nonvolatile High&#8208;Speed DRAM Cells Using Tailored Ultrathin IGZO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonvolatile dynamic random access memory (DRAM) using an optimized indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) transistor with record&#8208;high threshold voltage beyond 1.78&#160;V and on&#8208;current &gt;40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1 is demonstrated for the first time. The DRAM shows a record retention time exceeding 25 h with an ultra&#8208;fast write speed of 10&#160;ns under power interruption, along with a 3&#8208;bit multilevel operation with a wide margin and excellent linearity.








Abstract
Severe power consumption in the continuous scaling of Silicon&#8208;based dynamic random access memory (DRAM) technology quests for a transistor technology with a much lower off&#8208;state leakage current. Wide bandgap amorphous oxide semiconductors, especially indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO)&#160;exhibit many orders of magnitude lower off&#8208;state leakage. However, they are typically heavily n&#8208;doped and require negative gate voltage to turn off, which prevents them from true nonvolatile operation. The efforts on doping density reduction typically result in mobility degradation and high Schottky barriers at contacts, causing severe degradation of on&#8208;current and operation speed of the DRAM cells. Here, high&#8208;speed true nonvolatile DRAM cells are successfully demonstrated by deep suppression of doping density in the IGZO channel using in situ oxygen ion beam treatment and ohmic contact engineering by inserting a thin In&#8208;rich indium&#8208;tin&#8208;oxide (ITO) at contact regions. A record high on&#8208;current of 40&#160;&#181;A &#181;m&#8722;1&#160;at a large positive threshold voltage of 1.78&#160;V enables the first true nonvolatile DRAM with the fastest write speed of 10&#160;ns and data retention up to 25 h under power interruption, five orders of magnitude higher than the previously projected values.

Abstract
3D topological spin textures&#8212;hopfions&#8212;are predicted in helimagnetic systems but are not experimentally confirmed thus far. By utilizing an external magnetic field and electric current in the present study, 3D topological spin textures are realized, including fractional hopfions with nonzero topological index, in a skyrmion&#8208;hosting helimagnet FeGe. Microsecond current pulses are employed to control the dynamics of the expansion and contraction of a bundle composed of a skyrmion and a fractional hopfion, as well as its current&#8208;driven Hall motion. This research approach has demonstrated the novel electromagnetic properties of fractional hopfions and their ensembles in helimagnetic systems.

         <title>Catalytic Amounts of an Antibacterial Monomer Enable the Upcycling of Poly(Ethylene Terephthalate) Waste</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimal approach for the upcycling of plastics is reported, which permits the direct manufacture of high&#8208;value advanced materials and avoids monomer regeneration. More specifically, a novel strategy is provided for directly upcycling poly(ethylene terephthalate) waste to high&#8208;value antibacterial products. This procedure, which employs a catalytic amount of an antibacterial monomer, exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.








Abstract
Poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) is an important polymer with an annual output second only to polyethylene. The development of PET recycling technologies is therefore necessary to not only eliminate the harm associated with white pollution and microplastics, but also to reduce carbon emissions. Antibacterial PET, one of the most high&#8208;value advanced materials, has improved the ability to treat bacterial infections. However, current methods of manufacturing commercial antibacterial PET require blending with an excess of metal&#8208;based antibacterial agents, which leads to biotoxicity and a nonpersistent antibacterial activity. In addition, high&#8208;efficiency organic antibacterial agents have yet to be employed in antibacterial PET due to their poor thermal stabilities. Herein, a solid&#8208;state reaction for the upcycling of PET waste using a novel hyperthermostable antibacterial monomer is described. This reaction is catalyzed by the residual catalyst present in the PET waste. It is found that a catalytic amount of the antibacterial monomer enabled the low&#8208;cost upcycling of PET waste to produce high&#8208;value recycled PET with a strong and persistent antibacterial activity, as well as similar thermal properties to the virgin PET. This work provides a feasible and economic strategy for the large&#8208;scale upcycling of PET waste and exhibits potential for application in the polymer industry.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetism in 2D MnGa4&#8208;H Induced by Hydrogen Insertion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition method is developed to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H crystal. Hydrogen insertion inside the MnGa4 lattice can modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. 2D MnGa4&#8208;H is high&#8208;quality and air&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K.








Abstract
2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic materials are of great importance in future spintronic devices while only very few are reported. Herein, a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition approach is exploited to construct the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic MnGa4&#8208;H single crystal with a thickness down to 2.2&#160;nm. The employment of H2 plasma makes hydrogen atoms can be easily inserted into the MnGa4 lattice to modulate the atomic distance and charge state, thereby ferrimagnetism can be achieved without destroying the structural configuration. The as&#8208;obtained 2D MnGa4&#8208;H crystal is high&#8208;quality, air&#8208;stable, and thermo&#8208;stable, demonstrating robust and stable room&#8208;temperature magnetism with a high Curie temperature above 620&#160;K. This work enriches the 2D room&#8208;temperature magnetic family and opens up the possibility for the development of spintronic devices based on 2D magnetic alloys.

         <title>Specific and Long&#8208;Term Luminescent Monitoring of Hydrogen Peroxide in Tumor Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The clinical transformation of luminescent monitoring is obstructed by the limited light penetration depth, toxicity of nano&#8208;probes, and lack of long&#8208;term monitoring modes of up to days or months. Combined with the specific nano&#8208;probes and implantable microdevices, a biosafe monitoring of hydrogen peroxide for up to 20 days in the rat model of ovarian cancer is established.








Abstract
Luminescent monitoring of endogenous hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in tumors is conducive to understanding metastasis and developing novel therapeutics. The clinical transformation is obstructed by the limited light penetration depth, toxicity of nano&#8208;probes, and lack of long&#8208;term monitoring modes of up to days or months. New monitoring modes are introduced via specific probes and implantable devices, which can achieve real&#8208;time monitoring with a readout frequency of 0.01 s or long&#8208;term monitoring for months to years. Near&#8208;infrared dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs) are fabricated as the luminescent probes, and the specificity to reactive oxygen species is subtly regulated by the self&#8208;assembled monolayers on the surfaces of UCNPs. Combined with the passive implanted system, a 20&#8208;day monitoring of H2O2 in the rat model of ovarian cancer with peritoneal metastasis is achieved, in which the limited light penetration depth and toxicity of nano&#8208;probes are circumvented. The developed monitoring modes show great potential in accelerating the clinical transformation of nano&#8208;probes and biochemical detection methods.

         <title>Micro&#8208;Scale Mechanical Metamaterial with a Controllable Transition in the Poisson's Ratio and Band Gap Formation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a magnetically induced transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration being strongly auxetic and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The system allows to also concurrently control the band gap formation.








Abstract
The ability to significantly change the mechanical and wave propagation properties of a structure without rebuilding it is currently one of the main challenges in the field of mechanical metamaterials. This stems from the enormous appeal that such tunable behavior may offer from the perspective of applications ranging from biomedical to protective devices, particularly in the case of micro&#8208;scale systems. In this work, a novel micro&#8208;scale mechanical metamaterial is proposed that can undergo a transition from one type of configuration to another, with one configuration having a very negative Poisson's ratio, corresponding to strong auxeticity, and the other having a highly positive Poisson's ratio. The formation of phononic band gaps can also be controlled concurrently which can be very useful for the design of vibration dampers and sensors. Finally, it is experimentally shown that the reconfiguration process can be induced and controlled remotely through application of a magnetic field by using appropriately distributed magnetic inclusions.

         <title>Discovery of Topological Magnetic Textures near Room Temperature in Quantum Magnet TbMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological magnetic skyrmions are directly observed in quantum magnet TbMn6Sn6 by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy with corresponding topological Hall conductivity measured near room temperature, where the full spin reorientation transition occurs between the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes. The mechanism of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice is clarified by micromagnetic simulation.








Abstract
The study of topology in quantum materials has fundamentally advanced the understanding in condensed matter physics and potential applications in next&#8208;generation quantum information technology. Recently, the discovery of a topological Chern phase in the spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;coupled Kagome lattice TbMn6Sn6 has attracted considerable interest. Whereas these phenomena highlight the contribution of momentum space Berry curvature and Chern gap on the electronic transport properties, less is known about the intrinsic real space magnetic texture, which is crucial for understanding the electronic properties and further exploring the unique quantum behavior. Here, the stabilization of topological magnetic skyrmions in TbMn6Sn6 using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy near room temperature, where the spins experience full spin reorientation transition between the a&#8208; and c&#8208;axes, is directly observed. An effective spin Hamiltonian based on the Ginzburg&#8211;Landau theory is constructed and micromagnetic simulation is performed to clarify the critical role of Ruderman&#8211;Kittel&#8211;Kasuya&#8211;Yosida interaction on the stabilization of skyrmion lattice. These results not only uncover nontrivial spin topological texture in TbMn6Sn6, but also provide a solid basis to study its interplay with electronic topology.

         <title>Dynamic Stabilization of Metastable States in Triple&#8208;Well Ferroelectric Sn2P2S6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic hysteresis loops in nanoscale volumes reveal the signatures of a triple potential well, wherein a transient metastable state with zero polarization separates the transition between stable polarization states. The zero state is distinct from a domain wall, and it enhances mem&#8208;capacitive behavior with voltage&#8208;history dependent change of local dielectric properties.








Abstract
Polarization dynamics in ferroelectric materials is governed by the effective potential energy landscape of the order parameter. The unique aspect of ferroelectrics compared to many other transitions is the possibility of more than two potential wells, leading to complicated energy landscapes with new fundamental and functional properties. Here, direct dynamic evidence is revealed of a triple&#8208;well potential in the metal thiophosphate Sn2P2S6 compound using multivariate scanning probe microscopy combined with theoretical simulations. The key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of the triple&#8208;well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple&#8208;well of Sn2P2S6 becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well&#8208;defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple&#8208;well enhances mem&#8208;capacitive effects in Sn2P2S6, which are forbidden for ideal double&#8208;well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high&#8208;density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple&#8208;well.

The key finding is that the metastable zero polarization state can be accessed through a gradual switching process and is stabilized over a broad range of electric fields. Simulations confirm that the observed zero polarization state originates from a kinetic stabilization of the nonpolar state of the triple-well, as opposed to domain walls. Dynamically, the triple-well of Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; becomes equivalent to antiferroelectric hysteresis loops. Therefore, this material combines the robust and well-defined domain structure of a proper ferroelectric with dynamic hysteresis loops present in antiferroelectrics. Moreover, the triple-well enhances mem-capacitive effects in Sn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, which are forbidden for ideal double-well ferroelectrics. These findings provide a path to tunable electronic elements for beyond binary high-density computing devices and neuromorphic circuits based on dynamic properties of the triple-well.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergetic Lithium and Hydrogen Bonds Endow Liquid&#8208;Free Photonic Ionic Elastomer with Mechanical Robustness and Electrical/Optical Dual&#8208;Output</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds is introduced into an elastomer to provide liquid&#8208;free photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) with simultaneous mechanical robustness, satisfied ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color. The PIEs with mechanical strength up to 4.3 MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 demonstrate synchronous electrical/optical dual&#8208;outputs under various harsh conditions.








Abstract
Photonic ionic elastomers (PIEs) capable of multiple signal outputs are intriguing in flexible interactive electronics. However, fabricating PIEs with simultaneous mechanical robustness, good ionic conductivity, and brilliant structure color still remains challenging. Here, the limitations are broken through introducing the synergistic effect of lithium and hydrogen bonds into an elastomer. In virtue of lithium bonding between lithium ions and carbonyl groups in the polymer matrix as well as hydrogen bonding between silanol on the surface of silica nanoparticles (SiNPs) and ether groups along polymer chains, the PIEs demonstrate mechanical strength up to 4.3&#160;MPa and toughness up to 8.6&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3. Meanwhile, the synchronous electrical and optical output under mechanical strains can be achieved in the PIEs with the presence of dissociated ions contributed by lithium bond and non&#8208;close&#8208;packed SiNPs stabilized by the hydrogen bond. Moreover, due to their liquid&#8208;free nature, the PIEs exhibit extraordinary stability and durability, which can withstand extreme conditions including both high and low temperatures as well as high humidity. This work provides a promising molecular engineering route to construct high&#8208;performance photonic ionic conductors toward advanced ionotronic applications.

         <title>Repeatedly Recyclable 3D Printing Catalyst&#8208;Free Dynamic Thermosetting Photopolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers are developed by immobilized the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing. The generated resins demonstrate controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network presents an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;curing 3D printing technology has promoted the advanced manufacturing in various fields, but has exacerbated the environmental crisis by the demand for the chemically cross&#8208;linked thermosetting photopolymers. Here, the authors report a generic strategy to develop catalyst&#8208;free dynamic thermosetting photopolymers, based on photopolymerization and transesterification, that can enable users to realize repeatable 3D printing, providing a practical solution to the environmental challenges. That the &#946;&#8208;carbonyl group adjacent to the ester group greatly accelerates the rate of transesterification is demonstrated. The generated resins from the immobilization of the catalyst&#8208;free reversible bonds into the photopolymers leads to a dynamic covalently crosslinked network structure upon UV based 3D printing, which exhibit controllable mechanical properties with elastomeric behaviors to thermadapt shape memory polymers. Furthermore, the resulting network can be reverted into an acrylate&#8208;functioned photopolymer that is suitable for 3D printing again, presenting an on&#8208;demand, repeatedly recyclable thermosetting photopolymer platform for sustainable 3D printing.

         <title>Self&#8208;Adhesive Self&#8208;Healing Thermochromic Ionogels for Smart Windows with Excellent Environmental and Mechanical Stability, Solar Modulation, and Antifogging Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing poly(urethaneurea)&#8208;based self&#8208;adhesive thermochromic ionogels with mechanically and environmentally stable, reversible, healable, and tunable temperature&#8208;responsive optical performance are demonstrated. The ionogels have an antifogging ability that can guarantee good indoor lighting in cold weather. Reversible multiple hydrogen bonds between the poly(urethaneurea) allow the ionogels to spontaneously heal themselves at room temperature or be fully recycled by room&#8208;temperature pressing.








Abstract
Current thermochromic materials used in smart windows still face challenges, such as poor mechanical and environmental stability, unsatisfactory solar modulation capacity, and low transparency. Herein, the first self&#8208;adhesive self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels with excellent mechanical and environmental stability, antifogging capability, transparency, and solar modulation capability by loading binary ionic liquids (ILs) into rational&#8208;designed self&#8208;healing poly(urethaneurea) with acylsemicarbazide (ASCZ) moieties that have reversible and multiple hydrogen bonds are reported and their feasibility as smart windows with reliability and long service life is demonstrated. The self&#8208;healing thermochromic ionogels can switch between transparent and opaque without leakage or shrinkage, by the constrained reversible phase separation of ILs within the ionogels. The ionogels have the highest transparency and solar modulation capability among reported thermochromic materials and such excellent solar modulation capability can be well maintained after undergoing 1000 transitions, stretches, and bends, and storage at &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C, 60&#160;&#176;C, 90% RH, and vacuum environment for 2 months. The formation of high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds among the ASCZ moieties contributes to the excellent mechanical strength of the ionogels and allows the thermochromic ionogels to spontaneously heal their damages and be fully recycled at room temperature without the loss of thermochromic capabilities.

         <title>Scalable Polyimide&#8208;Organosilicate Hybrid Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is proposed to regulate the bulk&#8208;limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane with the chain ends of polyimide. The hybrid film exhibits superior capacitive performance, excellent charge&#8211;discharge stability, and power density even at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature polymer dielectrics have broad application prospects in next&#8208;generation microelectronics and electrical power systems. However, the capacitive energy densities of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures are severely limited by carrier excitation and transport. Herein, a molecular engineering strategy is presented to regulate the bulk&#8208;limited conduction in the polymer by bonding amino polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (NH2&#8208;POSS) with the chain ends of polyimide (PI). Experimental studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the terminal group NH2&#8208;POSS with a wide&#8208;bandgap of Eg &#8776; 6.6&#160;eV increases the band energy levels of the PI and induces the formation of local deep traps in the hybrid films, which significantly restrains carrier transport. At 200&#160;&#176;C, the hybrid film exhibits concurrently an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 3.45&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a high gravimetric energy density of 2.74&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1, with the charge&#8208;discharge efficiency &gt;90%, far exceeding those achieved in the dielectric polymers and nearly all other polymer nanocomposites. Moreover, the NH2&#8208;POSS terminated PI film exhibits excellent charge&#8208;discharge cyclability (&gt;50000) and power density (0.39&#160;MW&#160;cm&#8722;3) at 200&#160;&#176;C, making it a promising candidate for high&#8208;temperature high&#8208;energy&#8208;density capacitors. This work represents a novel strategy to scalable polymer dielectrics with superior capacitive performance operating in harsh environments.

         <title>Gadolinium (III)&#8208;Chelated Deformable Mesoporous Organosilica Nanoparticles as Magnetic Resonance Imaging Contrast Agent</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel deformable nanocarrier is synthesized that is easy to modify and load with drugs. The magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA (Magnevist) has longer blood circulation, higher relaxivity, and greater tissue specificity when loaded into the deformable nanocarrier.








Abstract
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) contrast agents, such as Magnevist (Gd&#8208;DTPA), are routinely used for detecting tumors at an early stage. However, the rapid clearance by the kidney of Gd&#8208;DTPA leads to short blood circulation time, which limits further improvement of the contrast between tumorous and normal tissue. Inspired by the deformability of red blood cells, which improves their blood circulation, this work fabricates a novel MRI contrast agent by incorporating Gd&#8208;DTPA into deformable mesoporous organosilica nanoparticles (D&#8208;MON). In vivo distribution shows that the novel contrast agent is able to depress rapid clearance by the liver and spleen, and the mean residence time is 20 h longer than Gd&#8208;DTPA. Tumor MRI studies demonstrated&#160;that the D&#8208;MON&#8208;based contrast agent is highly enriched in the tumor tissue and achieves prolonged high&#8208;contrast imaging. D&#8208;MON significantly improves the performance of clinical contrast agent Gd&#8208;DTPA, exhibiting good potential in clinical applications.

         <title>Localized Bound Multiexcitons in Engineered Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskites Grains at Room Temperature for Efficient Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature multiexcitonic amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) with threshold as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is reduced 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains, is demonstrated based on quasi&#8208;2D perovskite P2F8 with grains sized in hundreds&#8208;nm scale. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination that is detrimental to radiative emission.








Abstract
Reducing the excitation threshold to minimize the Joule heating is critical for the realization of perovskite laser diodes. Although bound excitons are promising for low threshold laser, how to generate them at room temperature for laser applications is still unclear in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite&#8208;based devices. In this work, via engineering quasi&#8208;2D perovskite PEA2(CH3NH3)n&#8208;1PbnBr3n+1 microscopic grains by the anti&#8208;solvent method, room&#8208;temperature multiexciton radiative recombination is successfully demonstrated at a remarkably low pump density of 0.97 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, which is only one&#8208;fourth of that required in 2D CdSe nanosheets. In addition, the well&#8208;defined translational momentum in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains can restrict the Auger recombination which is detrimental to radiative emission. Furthermore, the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite grains are favorable for increasing binding energies of excitons and biexcitons and so as the related radiative recombination. Consequently, the prepared &lt;n&#160;= 8&gt; phase quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film renders a threshold of room&#8208;temperature stimulated emission as low as 13.7 &#181;J cm&#8722;2, reduced by 58.6% relative to the amorphous counterpart with larger grains. The findings in this work are expected to facilitate the development of solution&#8208;processable perovskite multiexcitonic laser diodes.

         <title>Electronic/Optoelectronic Memory Device Enabled by Tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals Heterostructure for in&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing at the Optical Communication Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>

An optoelectronic/electronic memory device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression triggered by electrical pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation induced by 1550&#8208;nm laser pulses is fabricated from Te&#8208;based 2D van der Waals heterostructure, which holds great promise for fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC at the optical communication band.








Abstract
Although 2D materials are widely explored for data storage and neuromorphic computing, the construction of 2D material&#8208;based memory devices with optoelectronic responsivity in the short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) region for in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) at the optical communication band still remains a big challenge. In this work, an electronic/optoelectronic memory device enabled by tellurium&#8208;based 2D van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure is reported, where the ferroelectric CuInP2S6 and tellurium channel endow this device with both the long&#8208;term potentiation/depression by voltage pulses and short&#8208;term potentiation by 1550&#160;nm laser pulses (a typical wavelength in the conventional fiber optical communication band). Leveraging the rich dynamics, a fully memristive in&#8208;sensor RC system that can simultaneously sense, decode, and learn messages transmitted by optical fibers is demonstrated. The reported 2D vdW heterostructure&#8208;based memory featuring both the long&#8208;term and short&#8208;term memory behaviors using electrical and optical pulses in SWIR region has not only complemented the wide spectrum of applications of 2D materials family in electronics/optoelectronics but also paves the way for future smart signal processing systems at the edge.

         <title>Dry Lithography Patterning of Monolayer Flexible Field Effect Transistors by 2D Mica Stamping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dry patterning approach together with the electrode transfer method for 2D solution&#8208;processed organic single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors via bottom&#8208;up fabrication is demonstrated. High&#8208;performance flexible monolayer OFETs and high&#8208;speed organic rectifiers are fabricated based on these strategies.








Abstract
Organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2D monolayer organic semiconductors (OSC) have demonstrated promising potentials for various applications, such as light emitting diode (LED) display drivers, logic circuits, and wearable electrocardiography (ECG) sensors. To date, the fabrications of this class of highly crystallized 2D organic semiconductors (OSC) are dominated by solution shearing. As these organic active layers are only a few molecular layers thick, their compatibilities with conventional thermal evaporated top electrodes or sophisticated photolithography patterning are very limited, which also restricts their device density. Here, an electrode transfer stamp and a semiconductor patterning stamp are developed to fabricate OFETs with channel lengths down to 3 &#181;m over a large area without using any chemicals or causing any damage to the active layer. 2D 2,9&#8208;didecyldinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene (C10&#8208;DNTT) monolayer OFETs developed by this new approach shows decent performance properties with a low threshold voltage (VTH) less than 0.5 V, intrinsic mobility higher than 10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a subthreshold swing (SS) less than 100 mV dec&#8722;1. The proposed patterning approach is completely comparable with ultraflexible parylene substrate less than 2 &#181;m thick. By further reducing the channel length down to 2 &#181;m and using the monolayer OFET in an AC/DC rectifying circuit, the measured cutoff frequency is up to 17.3 MHz with an input voltage of 4 V. The newly proposed electrode transfer and patterning stamps have addressed the long&#8208;lasting compatibility problem of depositing electrodes onto 2D organic monolayer and the semiconductor patterning. It opens a new path to reduce the fabrication cost and simplify the manufacturing process of high&#8208;density OFETs for more advanced electronic or biomedical applications.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Quenching NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;Aggregates of Benzo[c]thiophene Fluorophore for Highly Efficient Bioimaging and Phototheranostics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bright benzo[c]thiophene J&#8208;aggregate with anti&#8208;quenching property is developed. The J&#8208;type nanoparticles (NPs) are featured with large Stokes shift of 402 nm. After forming aggregates in aqueous milieu, the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) fluorescence intensity is enhanced &#8776;26 folds due to aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) effect. The bright J&#8208;type AIE NPs are used to conduct whole&#8208;body blood vessel NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics.








Abstract
Molecular fluorophores with the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) emission hold great potential for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging owing to their excellent biocompatibility and high resolution. Recently, J&#8208;aggregates are used to construct long&#8208;wavelength NIR&#8208;II emitters as their optical bands show remarkable red shifts upon forming water&#8208;dispersible nano&#8208;aggregates. However, their wide applications in the NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging are impeded by the limited varieties of J&#8208;type backbone and serious fluorescence quenching. Herein, a bright benzo[c]thiophene (BT) J&#8208;aggregate fluorophore (BT6) with anti&#8208;quenching effect is reported for highly efficient NIR&#8208;II bioimaging and phototheranostics. The BT fluorophores are manipulated to have Stokes shift over 400&#160;nm and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) property for conquering the self&#8208;quenching issue of the J&#8208;type fluorophores. Upon forming BT6 assemblies in an aqueous environment, the absorption over 800&#160;nm and NIR&#8208;II emission over 1000&#160;nm are boosted for more than 41 and 26 folds, respectively. In vivo visualization of the whole&#8208;body blood vessel and imaging&#8208;guided phototherapy results verify that BT6 NPs are excellent agent for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging and cancer phototheranostics. This work develops a strategy to construct bright NIR&#8208;II J&#8208;aggregates with precisely manipulated anti&#8208;quenching properties for highly efficient biomedical applications.

         <title>An n&#8208;Type All&#8208;Fused&#8208;Ring Molecule with Photoresponse to 1000&#160;nm for Highly Sensitive Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;type all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring molecule with ultrasmall bandgap and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption is developed. Its fully fixed molecular conformation leads to low trap density in thin film and excellent device performance in NIR organic photodetector devices.








Abstract
Most of all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules have wide or medium bandgap and show photo response in the visible range. In this work, an all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring n&#8208;type molecule, which exhibits an ultrasmall optical bandgap of 1.22&#160;eV and strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption with an onset absorption wavelength of 1013&#160;nm is reported. The molecule consists of 14 aromatic rings and has electron donor&#8211;acceptor characteristics. It exhibits excellent n&#8208;type properties with low&#8208;lying HOMO/LUMO energy levels of &#8722;5.48&#160;eV/&#8722;3.95 eV and high electron mobility of 7.0&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1. Most importantly, its thin film exhibits a low trap density of 5.55&#160;&#215;&#160;1016&#160;cm&#8722;3 because of the fixed molecular conformation and consequently low conformation disorder. As a result, organic photodetector (OPD) based on the compound exhibits a remarkably low dark current density (Jd) of 2.01&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;10&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 0&#160;V. The device shows a shot&#8208;noise&#8208;limited specific detectivity (Dsh*) of exceeding 1013&#160;Jones at 400&#8211;1000&#160;nm wavelength region with a peak specific detectivity of 4.65&#160;&#215;&#160;1013&#160;Jones at 880&#160;nm. This performance is among the best reported for self&#8208;powered NIR OPDs.

         <title>Printable Thermochromic Hydrogel&#8208;Based Smart Window for All&#8208;Weather Building Temperature Regulation in Diverse Climates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermochromic smart windows based on thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogels with tunable response temperature show strong solar modulation in summer and irradiation blocking in winter to save building energy in diverse climates. The smart windows gain balanced temperature regulation and visibility through patterning with printed grids or kirigami, representing a breakthrough of smart windows for a low carbon economy.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows are widely developed to modulate building energy exchange to save building energy consumption. However, most smart windows have fixed working temperatures, moderate energy&#8208;saving efficiency, and are not suitable for diverse (cold and hot) climates. Here smart windows with strong temperature modulation over a broad range of hydrogels with adjustable transition temperatures for all&#8208;weather building temperature regulation in different climates are reported. Thermochromic poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;N, N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) hydrogels, with lower critical transition temperatures ranging from 32.5 to 43.5&#160;&#176;C, are developed for smart windows with solar modulation up to 88.84% and intrinsic transmittance up to 91.30% over full spectrum without energy input. Simulated indoor investigations are performed in different cities from 23 &#176;N to 39 &#176;N from winter to summer. The results indicate that smart windows have a strong solar modulation in summer to reduce indoor temperature up to 7.3&#160;&#176;C and efficient heat conservation in winter to save energy up to 4.30&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;3, in comparison to glass windows. Smart windows with grid patterns and Chinese kirigami are fabricated by using 3D printing of the hydrogels to achieve both solar modulation and light incidence. The strategy offers an innovative path for thermochromic smart windows for low carbon economy.

         <title>Liquid Metal Droplets&#8208;Based Elastomers from Electric Toothbrush&#8208;Inspired Revolving Microfluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a novel revolving microfluidic technology for the generation of liquid metal (LM) droplets is presented. The resultant LM droplets exhibit controllable size and are produced in high&#8208;throughput. The droplets act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The obtained LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers show potential prospects in flexible electronics&#8208;relevant applications.








Abstract
Liquid metal (LM)&#8208;based elastomers have a demonstrated value in flexible electronics. Attempts in this area include the development of multifunctional LM&#8208;based elastomers with controllable morphology, superior mechanical performances, and great stability. Herein, inspired by the working principle of electric toothbrushes, a revolving microfluidic system is presented for the generation of LM droplets and construction of desired elastomers. The system involves revolving modules assembled by a needles array and 3D microfluidic channels. LM droplets can be generated with controllable size in a high&#8208;throughput manner due to the revolving motion&#8208;derived drag force. It is demonstrated that by employing a poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) matrix as the collection phase, the generated LM droplets can act as conductive fillers for the construction of flexible electronics directly. The resultant LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers exhibit high mechanical strength, stable electrical performance, as well as superior self&#8208;healing property benefiting from the dynamic exchangeable urea bond of the polymer matrix. Notably, due to the flexible programmable feature of the LM droplets embedded within the elastomers, various patterned LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers can be easily achieved. These results indicate that the proposed microfluidic LM droplets&#8208;based elastomers have a great potential for promoting the development of flexible electronics.

         <title>Selective CO2 Electroreduction from Tuneable Naphthalene&#8208;Based Porous Polyimide Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here the developed Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) method is utilized to tune the porosity properties of crosslinked polyimides (pPIs) to optimize CO2 capture. Once optimized, these pPIs are exploited as metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the reduction of CO2 to formate and methanol. High Faradaic efficiencies (up to 91%) and selective reduction products are achieved via tuning of the porosity properties and surface areas.








Abstract
A series of porous polyimides (pPIs) are synthesized, and their surface areas and pore sizes are optimized by the previously reported Bristol&#8211;X'an&#8208;Jiatong (BXJ) approach.&#160;How&#160;this approach can be used to tune and optimize the porous network properties to target and tune their ability to capture CO2 is demonstrated. Once optimized, these porous organic frameworks are utilized, for the first time, as electrocatalysts for the conversion of CO2. The excellent Faradaic efficiencies (FEs) for the conversion of CO2 to formate (91%) and methanol (85%) present exciting opportunities for the metal&#8208;free generation of useful fuels and feedstocks from CO2. In addition, the ability to directly address and select the conversion products through tuning of the porous materials&#8217; properties highlights the potential of this approach, and more generally for a wide range of organic frameworks as future metal&#8208;free CO2 reduction catalysts.

         <title>Thermally Enhanced and Long Lifetime Red TADF Carbon Dots via Multi&#8208;Confinement and Phosphorescence Assisted Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface engineering strategy is developed to confine carbon dots into a rigid network derived from multiple ionic bonds, which efficiently promote reverse intersystem crossing rate, suppress non&#8208;radiative transition, and stabilize triplet excited states. These results endow carbon dots with unique thermally enhanced TADF luminescence, accompanied by a long lifetime via energy transfer from RTP donor.








Abstract
Thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials, which can harvest both singlet and triplet excitons for high&#8208;efficiency emission, have attracted widespread concern for their enormous applications. Nevertheless, luminescence thermal quenching severely limits the efficiency and operating stability in TADF materials and devices at high temperature. Herein, a surface engineering strategy is adopted to obtain unique carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;based thermally enhanced TADF materials with &#8776;250% enhancement from 273 to 343&#160;K via incorporating seed CDs into ionic crystal network. The rigid crystal network can simultaneously boost reverse intersystem crossing process via enhancing spin&#8208;orbit coupling between singlet and triplet states and suppressing non&#8208;radiative transition rate, contributing to the thermally enhanced TADF character. Benefiting from efficient energy transfer from triplet states of phosphorescence center to singlet states of CDs, TADF emission at &#8776;600&#160;nm in CDs displays a long lifetime up to 109.6&#160;ms, outperforming other red organic TADF materials. Thanks to variable decay rates of the delayed emission centers, time and temperature&#8208;dependent delayed emission color has been first realized in CDs&#8208;based delayed emission materials. The CDs with thermally enhanced and time&#8208;/temperature&#8208;dependent emission in one material system can offer new opportunities in information protection and processing.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Contained Alloy as a Robustly Adhered Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer for Planar and Stable Zinc Electrodeposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Interfacial Lattice Locking Layer is suzccessfully designed by electro&#8208;co&#8208;depositing Zn and Cu onto Zn electrodes, the as&#8208;formed CuZn5 alloy layer, which is robustly&#8208;adhered to the Zn electrodes, shows a low lattice misfit (&#948; = 0.036) to Zn (002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer.








Abstract
Stable zinc (Zn)/electrolyte interface is critical for developing rechargeable aqueous Zn&#8208;metal batteries with long&#8208;term stability, which requires the dense and stable Zn electrodeposition. Herein, an interfacial lattice locking (ILL) layer is constructed via the electro&#8208;codeposition of Zn and Cu onto the Zn electrodes. The ILL layer shows a low lattice misfit (&#948;&#160;= 0.036) with Zn(002) plane and selectively locks the lattice orientation of Zn deposits, enabling the epitaxial growth of Zn deposits layer by layer. Benefiting from the unique orientation&#8208;guiding and robustly adhered properties, the ILL layer enables the symmetric Zn||Zn cells to achieve an ultralong life span of &gt;6000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1 mAh cm&#8722;2, a low overpotential (65&#160;mV) at 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, and a stable Zn plating/stripping for &gt;90&#160;h at an ultrahigh Zn depth of discharge (&#8776;85%). Even with a limited Zn supply and a high current density (8.58&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), the ILL@Zn||Ni&#8208;doped MnO2 cells can still survive for &gt;2300 cycles.

         <title>Periphery Fusion Strategy of a Carbazole&#8208;Based Macrocycle toward Coplanar N&#8208;Heterocycloarene for High&#8208;Mobility Single&#8208;Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A periphery fusion strategy from single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked macrocycle to fully fused N&#8208;heterocycloarene containing four carbazole units fine&#8208;tunes electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. The N&#8208;heterocycloarene in single&#8208;crystal field&#8208;effect transistors exhibits maximum hole mobility of 2.06 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which sets a new mobility record for (hetero)cycloarenes&#8208;based organic field&#8208;effect transistors.








Abstract
Designing (hetero)cycloarenes through the modifications of the &#960;&#8208;topology and molecular packing of organic semiconductors has recently garnered considerable attention. However, their applications as an organic active layer in field&#8208;effect transistors are very limited, and the obtained hole carrier mobilities are less than 1 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1. In this work, a novel alkyl&#8208;substituted coplanar N&#8208;heterocycloarene (FM&#8208;C4) containing four carbazole units is successfully synthesized in crystalline form. As compared to the corresponding single&#8208;bond&#8208;linked carbazole&#8208;based macrocycle M&#8208;C4, it is found that the periphery fusion strategy greatly changes the electronic structures, energy levels, photophysical properties, host&#8211;guest interactions with fullerenes, and molecular crystal stacking motifs. In particular, the fully fused N&#8208;heterocycloarene FM&#8208;C4 exhibits a herringbone packing structure with an unusual long&#8208;range &#960;&#8722;&#960; overlap distance as low as 3.19 &#197;, whereas the single crystal of M&#8208;C4 demonstrates no &#960;&#8722;&#960; interactions. As a consequence, FM&#8208;C4 in single&#8208;crystal transistors displays the highest hole mobility of 2.06 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, significantly outperforming M&#8208;C4 and all the reported (hetero)cycloarenes and suggesting the high potential of (hetero)cycloarenes for organic electronic applications.

         <dc:description>
A novel foldable radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) system based on vertically separated metal electrodes is realized within a single sheet of paper using a combination of hydrophobic wax printing and water&#8208;based solution process. The RFEH system exhibits favorable RF/DC conversion efficiency, operating voltage, and stable foldability. This work shows great promise for remote powering of wearable and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices.








Abstract
Radio frequency energy harvesting (RFEH) systems have emerged as a critical component for powering devices and replacing traditional batteries, with paper being one of the most promising substrates for use in flexible RFEH systems. However, previous paper&#8208;based electronics with optimized porosity, surface roughness, and hygroscopicity still face limitations in terms of the development of integrated foldable RFEH systems within a single sheet of paper. In the present study, a&#160;novel wax&#8208;printing control and water&#8208;based solution process are&#160;used to realize an integrated foldable RFEH system within&#160;a single sheet of paper. The proposed paper&#8208;based&#160;device includes vertically layered&#160;foldable&#160;metal electrodes, a via&#8208;hole, and stable conductive patterns with a sheet resistance of less than 1&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. The proposed RFEH system exhibits an RF/DC conversion efficiency of 60% and an operating voltage of 2.1&#160;V in 100&#160;s at a distance of 50&#160;mm and a transmitted power of 50&#160;mW. The integrated RFEH system also demonstrates stable foldability, with RFEH performance maintained up to a folding angle of 150&#176;. The single&#8208;sheet paper&#8208;based RFEH system thus has the potential for use in practical applications associated with the remote powering of wearable and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things devices and in paper electronics.

         <title>Self&#8208;Doping Naphthalene Diimide Conjugated Polymers for Flexible Unipolar n&#8208;Type OTFTs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
New self&#8208;doping naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;based conjugated polymers are successfully designed and synthesized, and the effects of self&#8208;doping on the electronic properties of flexible organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are investigated. The appropriate doping level results in unipolar n&#8208;type charge&#8208;carrier properties with good operational/ambient stability/bending resistance. Therefore, self&#8208;doping can be used as a powerful strategy for the rational design of advanced OTFT materials.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance organic thin&#8208;film transistor (OTFT) materials is vital for flexible electronics. Numerous OTFTs are so far reported but obtaining high&#8208;performance and reliable OTFTs simultaneously for flexible electronics is still challenging. Herein, it is reported that self&#8208;doping in conjugated polymer enables high unipolar n&#8208;type charge mobility in flexible OTFTs, as well as good operational/ambient stability and bending resistance. New naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;conjugated polymers PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 and PNDI2T&#8208;NM50 with different contents of self&#8208;doping groups on their side chains are designed and synthesized. The effects of self&#8208;doping on the electronic properties of resulting flexible OTFTs are investigated. The results reveal that the flexible OTFTs based on self&#8208;doped PNDI2T&#8208;NM17 exhibit unipolar n&#8208;type charge&#8208;carrier properties and good operational/ambient stability thanks to the appropriate doping level and intermolecular interactions. The charge mobility and on/off ratio are fourfold and four orders of magnitude higher than those of undoped model polymer, respectively. Overall, the proposed self&#8208;doping strategy is useful for rationally designing OTFT materials with high semiconducting performance and reliability.

         <title>3D Printing a Low&#8208;Cost Miniature Accommodating Optical Microscope</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus&#8208;stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system assembly and alignment, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.








Abstract
This decade has witnessed the tremendous progress in miniaturizing optical imaging systems. Despite the advancements in 3D printing optical lenses at increasingly smaller dimensions, challenges remain in precisely manufacturing the dimensionally compatible optomechanical components and assembling them into a functional imaging system. To tackle this issue, the use of 3D printing to enable digitalized optomechanical component manufacturing, part&#8208;count&#8208;reduction design, and the inclusion of passive alignment features is reported here, all for the ease of system assembly. The key optomechanical components of a penny&#8208;sized accommodating optical microscope are 3D printed in 50 min at a significantly reduced unit cost near $4. By actuating a built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil motor, its accommodating capability is validated to focus on specimens located at different distances, and a focus&#8208;stacking function is further utilized to greatly extend depth of field. The microscope can be readily customized and rapidly manufactured to respond to task&#8208;specific needs in form factor and optical characteristics.

         <title>Robust Transport: An Artificial Solid Electrolyte Interphase Design for Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tenacious composite artificial solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with the integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. It can inhibit the penetration of lithium dendrites, reducing parasitic side reactions and active lithium loss in anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs).








Abstract
One of the most challenging issues in the practical implementation of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density anode&#8208;free lithium&#8208;metal batteries (AFLMBs) is the sharp capacity attenuation caused by the mechanical degradation of the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). However, developing an artificial SEI to address this issue remains a challenge due to the trade&#8208;off between ionic conductivity and mechanical robustness for general ionic conducting films. In this study, a tenacious composite artificial SEI with integrated heterostructure of lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) is prepared using a co&#8208;sputtering approach to achieve both high ionic conductivity and fracture toughness. The embedded LiF domain has an extremely high Young's modulus and surface energy compared with those of bulk LiPON film, enabling a significant increase in fracture toughness by an order of magnitude. Most importantly, the interface between LiPON and LiF in the integrated structure generates additional fast Li+&#8208;transport pathways, providing the artificial SEI with a conductivity higher than 10&#8722;6S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Consequently, the artificial SEI implementation significantly increases the cycling lifetime of the corresponding AFLMBs by &gt;250%. This study highlights the importance of fracture toughness for the structural integrity of batteries and provides suggestions for designing viable SEI materials for high&#8208;performance AFLMBs.

         <title>Engineering Pore Environments of Sulfate&#8208;Pillared Metal&#8208;Organic Framework for Efficient C2H2/CO2 Separation with Record Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering dense electronegative pore environments by the unmasked C&#63742;C moieties in SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn enables high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16833). The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process.








Abstract
Engineering pore environments exhibit great potential in improving gas adsorption and separation performances but require specific means for acetylene/carbon dioxide (C2H2/CO2) separation due to their identical dynamic diameters and similar properties. Herein, a novel sulfate&#8208;pillared MOF adsorbent (SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn) using 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetra(pyridin&#8208;4&#8208;yl) ethene (TEPE) ligand with dense electronegative pore surfaces is reported. Compared to the prototype SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn, SOFOUR&#8208;TEPE&#8208;Zn exhibits a higher C2H2 uptake (89.1 cm3 g&#8722;1), meanwhile the CO2 uptake reduces to 14.1 cm3 g&#8722;1, only 17.4% of that on SOFOUR&#8208;1&#8208;Zn (81.0 cm3 g&#8722;1). The high affinity toward C2H2 than CO2 is demonstrated by the benchmark C2H2/CO2 selectivity (16&#8201;833). Furthermore, dynamic breakthrough experiments confirm its application feasibility and good cyclability at various flow rates. During the desorption cycle, 60.1 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5% purity or 33.2 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.99% purity can be recovered by stepped purging and mild heating. The simulated pressure swing adsorption processes reveal that 75.5 cm3 g&#8722;1 C2H2 of 99.5+% purity with a high gas recovery of 99.82% can be produced in a counter&#8208;current blowdown process. Modeling studies disclose four favorable adsorption sites and dense packing for C2H2.

         <title>Ultrathin Nitride Ferroic Memory with Large ON/OFF Ratios for Analog In&#8208;Memory Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an ultrathin, epitaxial nitride ferroelectric heterostructure is demonstrated, showing high ON/OFF ratios, high uniformity, and good retention that enables multistate operation and linear analog computing with high accuracy. The results pave the way for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.








Abstract
Computing in the analog regime using nonlinear ferroelectric resistive memory arrays can potentially alleviate the energy constraints and complexity/footprint challenges imposed by digital von Neumann systems. Yet the current ferroelectric resistive memories suffer from either low ON/OFF ratios/imprint or limited compatibility with mainstream semiconductors. Here, for the first time, ferroelectric and analog resistive switching in an epitaxial nitride heterojunction comprising ultrathin (&#8776;5&#160;nm) nitride ferroelectrics, i.e., ScAlN, with potentiality to bridge the gap between performance and compatibility is demonstrated. High ON/OFF ratios (up to 105), high uniformity, good retention, (&lt;20% variation after &gt;&#160;105&#160;s) and cycling endurance (&gt;104) are simultaneously demonstrated in a metal/oxide/nitride ferroelectric junction. It is further demonstrated that the memristor can provide programmability to enable multistate operation and linear analogue computing as well as image processing with high accuracy. Neural network simulations based on the weight update characteristics of the nitride memory yielded an image recognition accuracy of 92.9% (baseline 96.2%) on the images from Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology. The non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level programmability and analog computing capability provide first&#8208;hand and landmark evidence for constructing advanced memory/computing architectures based on emerging nitride ferroelectrics, and promote homo and hybrid integrated functional edge devices beyond silicon.

         <title>An Edible Rechargeable Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By immobilizing on activated carbon, a widespread food additive, riboflavin (anode) and quercetin (cathode), common food ingredients and dietary supplements, a rechargeable edible battery is demonstrated. An acqueous electrolyte, a nori algae separator and a beeswax encapsulation complete the cell, which can operate at 0.65&#160;V.








Abstract
Edible electronics is a growing field that aims to produce digestible devices using only food ingredients and additives, thus addressing many of the shortcomings of ingestible electronic devices. Edible electronic devices will have major implications for gastrointestinal tract monitoring, therapeutics, as well as rapid food quality monitoring. Recent research has demonstrated the feasibility of edible circuits and sensors, but to realize fully edible electronic devices edible power sources are required, of which there have been very few examples. Drawing inspiration from living organisms, which use redox cofactors to power biochemical machines, a rechargeable edible battery formed from materials eaten in everyday life is developed. The battery is realized by immobilizing riboflavin and quercetin, common food ingredients and dietary supplements, on activated carbon, a widespread food additive. Riboflavin is used as the anode, while quercetin is used as the cathode. By encapsulating the electrodes in beeswax, a fully edible battery is fabricated capable of supplying power to small electronic devices. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept battery cell operated at 0.65&#160;V, sustaining a current of 48&#160;&#181;A for 12&#160;min. The presented proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept will open the doors to new edible electronic applications, enabling safer and easier medical diagnostics, treatments, and unexplored ways to monitor food quality.

         <title>Ultrabroadband Imaging Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Tellurene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale tellurene is synthesized under room temperature by exploiting pulsed&#8208;laser deposition. On this basis, tellurene&#8208;based photodetector arrays are constructed, manifesting outstanding photosensitivity with the optimal responsivity, external quantum efficiency, and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215; 109%, and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. Moreover, proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept ultrabroadband optical imaging is realized.








Abstract
High&#8208;resolution imaging is at the heart of the revolutionary breakthroughs of intelligent technologies, and it is established as an important approach toward high&#8208;sensitivity information extraction/storage. However, due to the incompatibility between non&#8208;silicon optoelectronic materials and traditional integrated circuits as well as the lack of competent photosensitive semiconductors in the infrared region, the development of ultrabroadband imaging is severely impeded. Herein, the monolithic integration of wafer&#8208;scale tellurene photoelectric functional units by exploiting room&#8208;temperature pulsed&#8208;laser deposition is realized. Taking advantage of the surface plasmon polaritons of tellurene, which results in the thermal perturbation promoted exciton separation, in situ formation of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane homojunction and negative expansion promoted carrier transport, as well as the band bending promoted electron&#8211;hole pair separation enabled by the unique interconnected nanostrip morphology, the tellurene photodetectors demonstrate wide&#8208;spectrum photoresponse from 370.6 to 2240&#160;nm and unprecedented photosensitivity with the optimized responsivity, external quantum efficiency and detectivity of 2.7&#160;&#215;&#160;107&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, 8.2&#160;&#215;&#160;109% and 4.5 &#215; 1015&#160;Jones. An ultrabroadband imager is demonstrated and high&#8208;resolution photoelectric imaging is realized. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept wafer&#8208;scale tellurene&#8208;based ultrabroadband photoelectric imaging system depicts a fascinating paradigm for the development of an advanced 2D imaging platform toward next&#8208;generation intelligent equipment.

         <title>Chemotaxis&#8208;guided Self&#8208;propelled Macrophage Motor for Targeted Treatment of Acute Pneumonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macrophage motors are engineered by sequentially internalizing curcumin&#8208;loaded MnO2 nanoparticles respectively modified with &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin and adamantane. Host&#8208;guest interactions drive intracellular self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles into supramolecular aggregates, to inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles and catalytically convert H2O2 to O2 that propels macrophage motor for rapid tissue infiltration and inflammation alleviation for efficient treatment of acute pneumonia in mice.








Abstract
Immune cells exhibit great potential as carriers of nanomedicine, attributed to their high tolerance to internalized nanomaterials and targeted accumulation in inflammatory tissues. However, the premature efflux of internalized nanomedicine during systemic delivery and slow infiltration into inflammatory tissues have limited their translational applications. Herein, a motorized cell platform as a nanomedicine carrier for highly efficient accumulation and infiltration in the inflammatory lungs and effective treatment of acute pneumonia are reported. &#946;&#8208;Cyclodextrin and adamantane respectively modified manganese dioxide nanoparticles are intracellularly self&#8208;assembled into large aggregates mediated via host&#8208;guest interactions, to effectively inhibit the efflux of nanoparticles, catalytically consume/deplete H2O2 to alleviate inflammation, and generate O2 to propel macrophage movement for rapid tissue infiltration. With curcumin loaded into MnO2 nanoparticles, macrophages carry the intracellular nano&#8208;assemblies rapidly into the inflammatory lungs via chemotaxis&#8208;guided, self&#8208;propelled movement, for effective treatment of acute pneumonia via immunoregulation induced by curcumin and the aggregates.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Amphiphilic Pyridinium Salt and Its Application in the Visualization of Level 3 Details in Latent Fingerprints</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of both lipophilic part and hydrophilic end in molecular architecture endows CPAB with amphiphilic nature. Thanks to the sensitivity to moisture, the self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan is observed by grinding in air. The visualization of level 3 details in latent fingerprints (LFPs) makes CPAB a promising indicator for individual information at crime scenes.








Abstract
Organic luminescent materials that can simultaneously achieve multimode mechanochromism and its water&#8208;vapor&#8208;induced recovery are desirable for practical applications but rarely reported. Herein, an amphiphilic compound, 4&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)&#8208;1&#8208;(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium bromide (CPAB), is designed by integrating a lipophilic aromatic unit and hydrophilic end in the molecular architecture. Self&#8208;recovered mechanochromism from brown to cyan is observed upon mechanical grinding in air. Comprehensive research by X&#8208;ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and single&#8208;crystal analysis reveals that the photoluminescence switch originates from the variation in intermolecular hydrogen bonds and molecular packing mode. The amphiphilic nature of CPAB allows water molecules to enter the crystalline lattice, forming two polymorphs of the crystalline phase, namely CPAB&#8208;D and CPAB&#8208;W. The hydrosoluble CPAB exhibits excellent capability in probing the level 3 details of fingerprints because its lipophilic part can target the fatty acid residues of fingerprints, leading to strong aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence. The research may inspire the design of latent fingerprint developers and application in forensics/anti&#8208;counterfeiting.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance, Highly Stretchable, Flexible Moist&#8208;Electric Generators via Molecular Engineering of Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and stretchable moist&#8208;electric generators are developed via a molecular engineering strategy, which fully leverages the molecular structure of hydrogels, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. It offers a record&#8208;high short&#8208;circuit current density due to enhanced moisture adsorption and ionic conductivity, holding great potential for next&#8208;generation self&#8208;powered protective wearables including spacesuits, helmets, medical suits.








Abstract
Harvesting energy from ubiquitous moisture has emerged as a promising technology, offering opportunities to power wearable electronics. However, low current density and inadequate stretching limit their integration into self&#8208;powered wearables. Herein, a high&#8208;performance, highly stretchable, and flexible moist&#8208;electric generator (MEG) is developed via molecular engineering of hydrogels. The molecular engineering involves the impregnation of lithium ions and sulfonic acid groups into the polymer molecular chains to create ion&#8208;conductive and stretchable hydrogels. This new strategy fully leverages the molecular structure of polymer chains, circumventing the addition of extra elastomers or conductors. A centimeter&#8208;sized hydrogel&#8208;based MEG can generate an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.81&#160;V and a short&#8208;circuit current density of up to 480&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2. This current density is more than ten times that of most reported MEGs. Moreover, molecular engineering improves the mechanical properties of hydrogels, resulting in a stretchability of 506%, representing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art level in reported MEGs. Notably, large&#8208;scale integration of the high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs is demonstrated to power wearables with integrated electronics, including respiration monitoring masks, smart helmets, and medical suits. This work provides fresh insights into the design of high&#8208;performance and stretchable MEGs, facilitating their application to self&#8208;powered wearables and broadening the application scenario.

3D Printing
In article number 2208365, Rihan Hai, Cheng Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a method for 3D printing the key optical and optomechanical components of a miniature accommodating optical microscope in 50 min for less than $4. Synergizing the built&#8208;in voice&#8208;coil&#8208;motor and compliant optomechanics facilitates focus stacking functionality for extending imaging depth. 3D printing enables digitized component manufacturing, part&#8208;count reduction, and passive alignment for the ease of system miniaturization and assembly, allowing rapid customizability toward task&#8208;specific needs.

         <title>Organic Photovoltaics Utilizing Small&#8208;Molecule Donors and Y&#8208;Series Nonfullerene Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The new generation of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) utilizing small&#8208;molecule donors and Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors has shown great progress in recent years, which provides distinctly different scenery from fullerene&#8208; and ITIC&#8208;series&#8208;based ASM&#8208;OSCs. The materials design strategy, morphology formation mechanism, and potential challenges for ASM&#8208;OSCs are systematically summarized.








Abstract
The emerging Y&#8208;series nonfullerene acceptors (Y&#8208;NFA) has prompted&#160;the rapid progress of power conversion efficiency (PCE) of all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells (ASM&#8208;OSCs) from around 12% to 17%. The excellent PCE improvement benefits from not only the outstanding properties of Y&#8208;series acceptors but also the successful development of small&#8208;molecule donors. The short&#8208;circuit current density, fill factor, and nonradiative recombination are all optimized to the unprecedented values, providing a scenery that is obviously different from the ITIC&#8208;series based ASM&#8208;OSCs. In this review, OSCs utilizing small&#8208;molecule donors and Y&#8208;NFA are summarized and classified in order to provide an up&#8208;to&#8208;date development overview and give an insight on structure&#8211;property correlation. Then, the characteristics of bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) formation of ASM&#8208;OSCs are discussed and compared with that of polymer&#8208;based OSCs. Finally, the challenges and outlook on designing ground&#8208;breaking small&#8208;molecule donor and forming an ideal BHJ morphology are discussed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in discharge products, whose reversibility closely affects the performance of Li&#8211;air batteries, are reviewed. The formation/decomposition mechanisms of discharge products, including Li2O2, LiOH, LiO2, Li2O, Li2CO3, and the determining factors for reversibility are systematically summarized. Perspectives for Li&#8211;air batteries, focused on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications, are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;air (Li&#8211;air) batteries stand out among the post&#8208;Li&#8208;ion batteries due to their high energy density, which has rapidly progressed in the past years. Regarding the fundamental mechanism of Li&#8211;air batteries that discharge products produced and decomposed during charging and recharging progress, the reversibility of products closely affects the battery performance. Along with the upsurge of the mainstream discharge products lithium peroxide, with devoted efforts to screening electrolytes, constructing high&#8208;efficiency cathodes, and optimizing anodes, much progress is made in the fundamental understanding and performance. However, the limited advancement is insufficient. In this case, the investigations of other discharge products, including lithium hydroxide, lithium superoxide, lithium oxide, and lithium carbonate, emerge and bring breakthroughs for the Li&#8211;air battery technologies. To deepen the understanding of the electrochemical reactions and conversions of discharge products in the battery, recent advances in the various discharge products, mainly focusing on the growth and decomposition mechanisms and the determining factors are systematically reviewed. The perspectives for Li&#8211;air batteries on the fundamental development of discharge products and future applications are also provided.

         <title>From Nanoscopic to Macroscopic Materials by Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Nanoparticle Aggregation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the different length&#8208;scale materials by stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation is presented. The design strategy for NP aggregation by external stimuli, the recent progress, and the applications are summarized. The main challenges for the development of functional materials at different length scales are analyzed and prospects for the potential applications in different fields are discussed.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive nanoparticle (NP) aggregation plays an increasingly important role in regulating NP assembly into microscopic superstructures, macroscopic 2D, and 3D functional materials. Diverse external stimuli are widely used to adjust the aggregation of responsive NPs, such as light, temperature, pH, electric, and magnetic fields. Many unique structures based on responsive NPs are constructed including disordered aggregates, ordered superlattices, structural droplets, colloidosomes, and bulk solids. In this review, the strategies for NP aggregation by external stimuli, and their recent progress ranging from nanoscale aggregates, microscale superstructures to macroscale bulk materials along the length scales as well as their applications are summarized. The future opportunities and challenges for designing functional materials through NP aggregation at different length scales are also discussed.

         <title>Revisiting the Nature of Chemical Bonding in Chalcogenides to Explain and Design their Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 20, May 18, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum chemical bonding descriptors enable a quantitative description of bonding in chalcogenides. These descriptors are employed as property predictors for optical and transport properties. Hence, they can be utilized to tailor thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and phase&#8208;change memories. Their unusual property portfolio is attributed to a novel bonding mechanism, different from ionic, metallic, and covalent bonding, which is called &#8220;metavalent.&#8221;








Abstract
Quantum chemical bonding descriptors have recently been utilized to design materials with tailored properties. Their usage to facilitate a quantitative description of bonding in chalcogenides as well as the transition between different bonding mechanisms is reviewed. More importantly, these descriptors can also be employed as property predictors for several important material characteristics, including optical and transport properties. Hence, these quantum chemical bonding descriptors can be utilized to tailor material properties of chalcogenides relevant for thermoelectrics, photovoltaics, and phase&#8208;change memories. Relating material properties to bonding mechanisms also shows that there is a class of materials, which are characterized by unconventional properties such as a pronounced anharmonicity, a large chemical bond polarizability, and strong optical absorption. This unusual property portfolio is attributed to a novel bonding mechanism, fundamentally different from ionic, metallic, and covalent bonding, which is called &#8220;metavalent.&#8221; In the concluding section, a number of promising research directions are sketched, which explore the nature of the property changes upon changing bonding mechanism and extend the concept of quantum chemical property predictors to more complex compounds.

         <title>Jellybean Quantum Dots in Silicon for Qubit Coupling and On&#8208;Chip Quantum Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Such a jellybean dot is formed in a silicon&#8208;MOS quantum device and reported to support controlled charge filling and well&#8208;defined spin states for higher charge occupations, corroborating its potential for qubit&#8211;qubit couplers in quantum computing architectures.








Abstract
The small size and excellent integrability of silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (SiMOS) quantum dot spin qubits make them an attractive system for mass&#8208;manufacturable, scaled&#8208;up quantum processors. Furthermore, classical control electronics can be integrated on&#8208;chip, in&#8208;between the qubits, if an architecture with sparse arrays of qubits is chosen. In such an architecture qubits are either transported across the chip via shuttling or coupled via mediating quantum systems over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances. This paper investigates the charge and spin characteristics of an elongated quantum dot&#8212;a so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dot&#8212;for the prospects of acting as a qubit&#8211;qubit coupler. Charge transport, charge sensing, and magneto&#8208;spectroscopy measurements are performed on a SiMOS quantum dot device at mK temperature and compared to Hartree&#8211;Fock multi&#8208;electron simulations. At low electron occupancies where disorder effects and strong electron&#8211;electron interaction dominate over the electrostatic confinement potential, the data reveals the formation of three coupled dots, akin to a tunable, artificial molecule. One dot is formed centrally under the gate and two are formed at the edges. At high electron occupancies, these dots merge into one large dot with well&#8208;defined spin states, verifying that jellybean dots have the potential to be used as qubit couplers in future quantum computing&#160;architectures.

         <title>Alloying of Cu with Ru Enabling the Relay Catalysis for Reduction of Nitrate to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Converting NO3&#8722; to NH3 with renewable energy is of great practical significance to balance the environmental problems and economic benefits. Ru1Cu10 alloy exhibits high activity for direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3 under an ultralow potential due to a relay effect on Cu (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722;) and Ru (NO2&#8722; to NH3) sites.








Abstract
Involving eight electron transfer process and multiple intermediates of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction leads to a sluggish kinetic and low Faradaic efficiency, therefore, it is essential to get an insight into the reaction mechanism to develop highly efficient electrocatalyst. Herein, a series of reduced&#8208;graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;supported RuCu alloy catalysts (RuxCux/rGO) are fabricated and used for the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. It is found that the Ru1Cu10/rGO shows the ammonia formation rate of 0.38&#160;mmol cm&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (loading 1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and the ammonia Faradaic efficiency of 98% under an ultralow potential of &#8722;0.05&#160;V versus Reversible Hydrogen Electode (RHE), which is comparable to Ru catalyst. The highly efficient activity of Ru1Cu10/rGO can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Ru and Cu sites via a relay catalysis, in which the Cu shows the exclusively efficient activity for the reduction of NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and Ru exhibits the superior activity for NO2&#8722; to NH3. In addition, the doping of Ru into Cu tunes the d&#8208;band center of alloy and effectively modulates the adsorption energy of the NO3&#8722; and NO2&#8722;, which promotes the direct reduction of NO3&#8722; to NH3. This synergetic electrocatalysis strategy opens a new avenue for developing highly efficient multifunctional catalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, distinct reaction dynamics and phase transformations during (de)lithiation of rocksalt high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) are visualized by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, revealing composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics and spatiotemporal variations of valence states. Unexpectedly, the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase can be fully and reversibly recovered to the original rocksalt structure upon delithiation. These findings afford valuable guidelines to compositionally engineer novel HEO electrodes.








Abstract
Configurational entropy&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;phase high&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) have been considered revolutionary electrode materials with both reversible lithium storage and high specific capacity that are difficult to fulfill simultaneously by conventional electrodes. However, precise understanding of lithium storage mechanisms in such HEOs remains controversial due to complex multi&#8208;cationic oxide systems. Here, distinct reaction dynamics and structural evolutions in rocksalt&#8208;type HEOs upon cycling are carefully studied by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) including imaging, electron diffraction, and electron energy loss spectroscopy at atomic scale. The mechanisms of composition&#8208;dependent conversion/alloying reaction kinetics along with spatiotemporal variations of valence states upon lithiation are revealed, characterized by disappearance of the original rocksalt phase. Unexpectedly, it is found from the first visualization evidence that the post&#8208;lithiation polyphase state can be recovered to the original rocksalt&#8208;structured HEOs via reversible and symmetrical delithiation reactions, which is unavailable for monometallic oxide systems. Rigorous electrochemical tests coupled with postmortem ex situ TEM and bulk&#8208;level phase analyses further validate the crucial role of structural recovery capability in ensuring the reversible high&#8208;capacity Li&#8208;storage in HEOs. These findings can provide valuable guidelines to design compositionally engineer HEOs for almighty electrodes of next&#8208;generation long&#8208;life energy storage devices.

         <title>Reusable Electronic Tongue Based on Transient Receptor Potential Vanilloid 1 Nanodisc&#8208;Conjugated Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistor for a Spiciness&#8208;Related Pain Evaluation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pain&#8208;related receptor transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 is activated by noxious stimuli such as chemical, physical, and thermal stimuli. The stimuli of pungent compounds induce a sensation of burning or prickling of the tongue. To verify reversible TRPV1 activation to pungent materials, a reusable electronic tongue based on TRPV1 nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is presented.








Abstract
The sense of spiciness is related to the stimulation of vanilloid compounds contained in the foods. Although, the spiciness is commonly considered as the part of taste, it is more classified to the sense of pain stimulated on a tongue, namely, pungency, which is described as a tingling or burning on the tongue. Herein, first, a reusable electronic tongue based on a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1) nanodisc conjugated graphene field&#8208;effect transistor is fabricated and spiciness&#8208;related pain evaluation with reusable electrode is demonstrated. The pungent compound reactive receptor TRPV1 is synthesized in the form of nanodiscs to maintain stability and reusability. The newly developed platform shows highly selective and sensitive performance toward each spiciness related vanilloid compound repeatably: 1 aM capsaicin, 10 aM dihydrocapsaicin, 1 fM piperine, 10&#160;nM allicin, and 1 pM AITC. The binding mechanism is also examined by simulation. Furthermore, the elimination of the burning sensation on the tongue after eating spicy foods is not investigated. Based on the synthesis of micelles composed of casein protein (which is contained in skim milk) that remove pungent compounds bound to TRPV1 nanodisc, the deactivation of TRPV1 is investigated, and the electrode is reusable that mimics electronic tongue.

         <title>Anisotropic Excitons Reveal Local Spin Chain Directions in a van der Waals Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order. It is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission in NiPS3 rotate locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnetic order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments.








Abstract
A long&#8208;standing pursuit in materials science is to identify suitable magnetic semiconductors for integrated information storage, processing, and transfer. Van der Waals magnets have brought forth new material candidates for this purpose. Recently, sharp exciton resonances in antiferromagnet NiPS3 have been reported to correlate with magnetic order, that is, the exciton photoluminescence intensity diminishes above the N&#233;el temperature. Here, it is found that the polarization of maximal exciton emission rotates locally, revealing three possible spin chain directions. This discovery establishes a new understanding of the antiferromagnet order hidden in previous neutron scattering and optical experiments. Furthermore, defect&#8208;bound states are suggested as an alternative exciton formation mechanism that has yet to be explored in NiPS3. The supporting evidence includes chemical analysis, excitation power, and thickness dependent photoluminescence and first&#8208;principles calculations. This mechanism for exciton formation is also consistent with the presence of strong phonon side bands. This study shows that anisotropic exciton photoluminescence can be used to read out local spin chain directions in antiferromagnets and realize multi&#8208;functional devices via spin&#8208;photon transduction.

         <title>Geometric Tuning of Single&#8208;Atom FeN4 Sites via Edge&#8208;Generation Enhances Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Geometric tuning of single&#8208;atom active sites is desirable way to enhance catalytic activity. H2O2&#8208;etching to carbon matrix generates abundant edge&#8208;located FeN4 sites with distinct geometric and electronic structures compared to basal plane&#8208;located FeN4 sites. FeNC&#8208;edge with the unique local environment exhibits remarkably improved multi&#8208;enzymatic activity and inhibits tumor growth effectively.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes) are considered promising alternatives to natural enzymes. The catalytic performance of SAzymes featuring homogeneous, well&#8208;defined active structures can be enhanced through elucidating structure&#8208;activity relationship and tailoring physicochemical properties. However, manipulating enzymatic properties through structural variation is an underdeveloped approach. Herein, the synthesis of edge&#8208;rich Fe single&#8208;atom nanozymes (FeNC&#8208;edge) via an H2O2&#8208;mediated edge generation is reported. By controlling the number of edge sites, the peroxidase (POD)&#8208; and oxidase (OXD)&#8208;like performance is significantly enhanced. The activity enhancement results from the presence of abundant edges, which provide new anchoring sites to mononuclear Fe. Experimental results combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that FeN4 moieties in the edge sites display high electron density of Fe atoms and open N atoms. Finally, it is demonstrated that FeNC&#8208;edge nanozyme effectively inhibits tumor growth both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting that edge&#8208;tailoring is an efficient strategy for developing artificial enzymes as novel catalytic therapeutics.

         <title>Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta&#8208;Doped Weyl Semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The superconducting transition temperature is greatly enhanced to be as large as 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals, which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level.&#160;We&#160;also find the enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.








Abstract
2D transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next&#8208;generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te2 series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te2 remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, the significantly enhanced superconductivity is observed with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in Td&#8208;phase Mo1&#8722;xTaxTe2 (x&#160;= 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. This work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.

     alt="Enhanced Superconductivity and Upper Critical Field in Ta-Doped Weyl Semimetal Td-MoTe2"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superconducting transition temperature is greatly enhanced to be as large as 7.5 K in bulk Mo&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ta&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals, which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level.&#160;We&#160;also find the enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit in Ta-doped Weyl semimetal &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal dichalcogenides are promising platforms for next-generation electronics and spintronics. The layered Weyl semimetal (W,Mo)Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; series features structural phase transition, nonsaturated magnetoresistance, superconductivity, and exotic topological physics. However, the superconducting critical temperature of the bulk (W,Mo)Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains ultralow without applying a high pressure. Here, the significantly enhanced superconductivity is observed with a transition temperature as large as about 7.5 K in bulk Mo&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ta&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals upon Ta doping (0 &#8804; &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8804; 0.22), which is attributed to an enrichment of density of states at the Fermi level. In addition, an enhanced perpendicular upper critical field of 14.5 T exceeding the Pauli limit is also observed in &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-phase Mo&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Ta&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0.08), indicating the possible emergence of unconventional mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity owing to the inversion symmetry breaking. This work provides a new pathway for exploring the exotic superconductivity and topological physics in transition metal dichalcogenides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Realizing the Heteromorphic Superlattice: Repeated Heterolayers of Amorphous Insulator and Polycrystalline Semiconductor with Minimal Interface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superlattices represent the epitome of combinatorial materials science: their properties can transcend those of their constituent layers, such as improved mobility with modulation doped structures. Here superlattice combinations are expanded into the morphological domain by introducing direct growth of alternating amorphous and polycrystalline layers, realizing a high&#8208;quality, high mobility &#8220;heteromorphic superlattice,&#8221; originally conceived by Raphael Tsu in 1989.








Abstract
An unconventional &#8220;heteromorphic&#8221; superlattice (HSL) is realized, comprised of repeated layers of different materials with differing morphologies: semiconducting pc&#8208;In2O3 layers interleaved with insulating a&#8208;MoO3 layers. Originally proposed by Tsu in 1989, yet never fully realized, the high quality of the HSL heterostructure demonstrated here validates the intuition of Tsu, whereby the flexibility of the bond angle in the amorphous phase and the passivation effect of the oxide at interfacial bonds serve to create smooth, high&#8208;mobility interfaces. The alternating amorphous layers prevent strain accumulation in the polycrystalline layers while suppressing defect propagation across the HSL. For the HSL with 7:7&#160;nm layer thickness, the observed electron mobility of 71 cm2&#160;Vs&#8208;1, matches that of the highest quality In2O3 thin films. The atomic structure and electronic properties of crystalline In2O3/amorphous MoO3 interfaces are verified using ab&#8208;initio molecular dynamics simulations and hybrid functional calculations. This work generalizes the superlattice concept to an entirely new paradigm of morphological combinations.

         <title>Integrating Mixed Halide Perovskite Photocatalytic HI Splitting and Electrocatalysis into a Loop for Efficient and Robust Pure Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The difficult pure water splitting is disassembled into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the designed photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.








Abstract
Developing a hydrogen economy to replace traditional fossil fuels is essential for sustainable human development. As two promising H2 production strategies, photocatalytic and electrocatalytic water splitting with large reaction energy barriers still face the great challenges of poor solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen efficiency and large electrochemical overpotentials, respectively. Herein, a new strategy is proposed to disassemble the difficult pure water splitting into two parts that are easy to implement, namely mixed halide perovskite photocatalytic HI splitting for H2 production, and simultaneous electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production. The efficient charge separation, abundant H2 production active sites, and a small HI splitting energy barrier contribute to the superior photocatalytic H2 production activity of MoSe2/MAPbBr3&#8722;xIx (CH3NH3+&#160;= MA). Subsequent electrocatalytic I3&#8722; reduction and O2 production reactions only need a small voltage of 0.92&#160;V to drive, which is far lower than that of the electrocatalytic pure water splitting (&gt;1.23&#160;V). The molar ratio of H2 (6.99&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) to O2 (3.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1) produced during the first photocatalytic and electrocatalytic cycle is close to 2:1, and the continuous circulation of I3&#8722;/I&#8722; between the photocatalytic and electrocatalytic systems can achieve efficient and robust pure water splitting.

         <title>Near&#8208; and Long&#8208;Range Electronic Modulation of Single Metal Sites to Boost CO2 Electrocatalytic Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand and surrounded phosphorus atoms are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports, which exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction. The total energy efficiency of CO2RR device can be improved by coupling with anodic hydrazine oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Tuning the electronic structure of the active center is effective to improve the intrinsic activity of single&#8208;atom catalysts but the realization of precise regulation remains challenging. Herein, a strategy of &#8220;synergistically near&#8208; and long&#8208;range regulation&#8221; is reported to effectively modulate the electronic structure of single&#8208;atom sites. ZnN4 sites decorated with axial sulfur ligand in the first coordination and surrounded phosphorus atoms in the carbon matrix are successfully constructed in the hollow carbon supports (ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC). ZnN4S1/P&#8208;HC exhibits excellent performance for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) with a Faraday efficiency of CO close to 100%. The coupling of the CO2RR with thermodynamically favorable hydrazine oxidation reaction to replace oxygen evolution reaction in a two&#8208;electrode electrolyzer can greatly lower the cell voltage by 0.92&#160;V at a current density of 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, theoretically saving 46% of energy consumption. Theoretical calculation reveals that the near&#8208;range regulation with axial thiophene&#8208;S ligand and long&#8208;range regulation with neighboring P atoms can synergistically lead to the increase of electron localization around the Zn sites, which strengthens the adsorption of *COOH intermediate and therefore boosts the CO2RR.

Intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior is observed in the bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC nanosheets. Thickness&#8208;dependent magnetic textures are studied and applied in neuromorphic computing tasks.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic chromium tellurides exhibit intriguing spin configurations and high&#8208;temperature intrinsic ferromagnetism, providing unprecedented opportunities to explore the fundamental spin physics and build spintronic devices. Here, a generic van der Waals epitaxial approach is developed to synthesize the 2D ternary chromium tellurium compounds with thicknesses down to mono&#8208;, bi&#8208;, tri&#8208;, and few&#8208;unit cells&#160;(UC). The Mn0.14Cr0.86Te evolves from intrinsic ferromagnetic behavior in bi&#8208;UC, tri&#8208;UC, and few&#8208;UC to temperature&#8208;induced ferrimagnetic behavior as the thickness increases, resulting in a sign reversal of the anomalous Hall resistance. Temperature&#8208; and thickness&#8208;tunable labyrinthine&#8208;domain ferromagnetic behaviors are derived from the dipolar interactions in Fe0.26Cr0.74Te and Co0.40Cr0.60Te. Furthermore, the dipolar&#8208;interaction&#8208;induced stripe domain and field&#8208;induced domain wall (DW) motion velocity are studied, and multibit data storage is realized through an abundant DW state. The magnetic storage can function in neuromorphic computing tasks, and the pattern recognition accuracy can reach up to 97.93%, which is similar to the recognition accuracy of ideal software&#8208;based training (98.28%). Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic chromium tellurium compounds with intriguing spin configurations can significantly promote the exploration of the processing, sensing, and storage based on 2D magnetic systems.

Abstract
A unique class of advanced materials&#8212;quantum composites based on polymers with fillers composed of a van der Waals quantum material that reveals multiple charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave quantum condensate phases&#8212;is demonstrated. Materials that exhibit quantum phenomena are typically crystalline, pure, and have few defects because disorder destroys the coherence of the electrons and phonons, leading to collapse of the quantum states. The macroscopic charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phases of filler particles after multiple composite processing steps are successfully preserved in this work. The prepared composites display strong charge&#8208;density&#8208;wave phenomena even above room temperature. The dielectric constant experiences more than two orders of magnitude enhancement while the material maintains its electrically insulating properties, opening a venue for advanced applications in energy storage and electronics. The results present a conceptually different approach for engineering the properties of materials, extending the application domain for van der Waals materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Small Nano&#8208;Assemblies as Tumor&#8208;Targeted and Renal Clearable Theranostic Agent for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, an ultra&#8208;small nano photosensitizer is presented through a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy that can target a disease state, boost reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, as well as be cleared efficiently from the body in a reasonable amount of time.








Abstract
It is a challenge to design photosensitizers to balance between the tumor&#8208;targeting enrichment for precise treatment and efficient clearance within a reasonable timescale for reducing side effects. Herein, an ultra&#8208;small nano&#8208;photosensitizer 1a with excellent tumor&#8208;specific accumulation and renal clearance is reported. It is formed from the self&#8208;assembly of compound 1 bearing three triethylene glycol (TEG) arms&#160;and two pyridinium groups in water. The positively charged surface with neutral TEG coating enables 1a to efficiently target the tumor, with the signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio reaching as high as 11.5 after tail intravenous injection. The ultra&#8208;small size of 1a with an average diameter of 5.6&#160;nm allows its fast clearance through kidney. Self&#8208;assembly also endows 1a with an 18.2&#8208;fold enhancement of reactive oxygygen species generation rate compared to compound 1 in organic solution. Nano&#8208;PS 1a manifests an excellent photodynamic therapy efficacy on tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. This work provides a promising design strategy of photosensitizers with renal clearable and tumor&#8208;targeting ability.

         <title>User&#8208;Controlled 4D Biomaterial Degradation with Substrate&#8208;Selective Sortase Transpeptidases for Single&#8208;Cell Biology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using engineered sortase transpeptidases that orthogonally recognize and cleave peptide substrates largely absent from the mammalian proteome, multiplexed cell liberation from within 3D hydrogel biomaterials is uniquely achieved without significantly altering cell fate. Cell recovery is compatible with downstream single&#8208;cell&#8208;based functional assays including flow cytometry.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive biomaterials show great promise for modeling disease dynamics ex vivo with spatiotemporal control over the cellular microenvironment. However, harvesting cells from such materials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state remains an outstanding challenge in 3/4&#8208;dimensional (3D/4D) culture and tissue engineering. In this manuscript, a fully enzymatic strategy for hydrogel degradation that affords spatiotemporal control over cell release while maintaining cytocompatibility is introduced. Exploiting engineered variants of the sortase transpeptidase evolved to recognize and selectively cleave distinct peptide sequences largely absent from the mammalian proteome, many limitations implicit to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art methods to liberate cells from gels are sidestepped. It is demonstrated that evolved sortase exposure has minimal impact on the global transcriptome of primary mammalian cells and that proteolytic cleavage proceeds with high specificity; incorporation of substrate sequences within hydrogel crosslinkers permits rapid and selective cell recovery with high viability. In composite multimaterial hydrogels, it is shown that sequential degradation of hydrogel layers enables highly specific retrieval of single&#8208;cell suspensions for phenotypic analysis. It is expected that the high bioorthogonality and substrate selectivity of the evolved sortases will lead to their broad adoption as an enzymatic material dissociation cue and that their multiplexed use will enable newfound studies in 4D cell culture.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Resolved Imaging of Antiferromagnetic Order in Fe4Se5 Ultrathin Films on SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe4Se5 ultrathin films are experimentally demonstrated to host a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, evident with magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent spin contrasts in real&#8208;space by spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy. The AFM order is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling and exhibits three types of nanoscale AFM domains, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures.








Abstract
Unraveling the magnetic order in iron chalcogenides and pnictides at atomic scale is pivotal for understanding their unconventional superconducting pairing mechanism, but is experimentally challenging. Here, by utilizing spin&#8208;polarized scanning tunneling microscopy, real&#8208;space spin contrasts are successfully resolved to exhibit atomically unidirectional stripes in Fe4Se5 ultrathin films, the plausible closely related compound of bulk FeSe with ordered Fe&#8208;vacancies, which are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. As is substantiated by the first&#8208;principles electronic structure calculations, the spin contrast originates from a pair&#8208;checkerboard antiferromagnetic ground state with in&#8208;plane magnetization, which is modulated by a spin&#8211;lattice coupling. These measurements further identify three types of nanoscale antiferromagnetic domains with distinguishable spin contrasts, which are subject to thermal fluctuations into short&#8208;ranged patches at elevated temperatures. This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe&#8208;derived superconductors.

This work provides promising opportunities in understanding the emergent magnetic order and the electronic phase diagram for FeSe-derived superconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volumetric Printing of Thiol&#8208;Ene Photo&#8208;Cross&#8208;Linkable Poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone): A Tunable Material Platform Serving Biomedical Applications</title>

         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;ene cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;is introduced and the effect of the cross&#8208;link density on the networks&#8217; physico&#8208;chemical properties, volumetric printability, and biocompatibility is investigated. Notably, this is the first report on volumetric 3D&#8208;printing of polyesters and 3D&#8208;printing of the smallest features to date, for non&#8208;acrylate&#8208;based resins, is illustrated.








Abstract
Current thoroughly described biodegradable and cross&#8208;linkable polymers mainly rely on acrylate cross&#8208;linking. However, despite the swift cross&#8208;linking kinetics of acrylates, the concomitant brittleness of the resulting materials limits their applicability. Here, photo&#8208;cross&#8208;linkable poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#160;networks through orthogonal thiol&#8208;ene chemistry are introduced. The step&#8208;growth polymerized networks are tunable, predictable by means of the rubber elasticity theory and it is shown that their mechanical properties are significantly improved over their acrylate cross&#8208;linked counterparts. Tunability is introduced to the materials, by altering Mc (or the molar mass between cross&#8208;links), and its effect on the thermal properties, mechanical strength and degradability of the materials is evaluated. Moreover, excellent volumetric printability is illustrated and the smallest features obtained via volumetric 3D&#8208;printing to date are reported, for thiol&#8208;ene systems. Finally, by means of in vitro and in vivo characterization of 3D&#8208;printed constructs, it is illustrated that the volumetrically 3D&#8208;printed materials are biocompatible. This combination of mechanical stability, tunability, biocompatibility, and rapid fabrication by volumetric 3D&#8208;printing charts a new path toward bedside manufacturing of biodegradable patient&#8208;specific implants.

         <title>A Concerted Redox&#8208; and Light&#8208;Activated Agent for Controlled Multimodal Therapy against Hypoxic Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hypoxia represents a compelling tumor therapeutic target. The first metal&#8208;based multimodal theranostic agent (RuAzNM) for targeting hypoxia is reported. The&#160;activity of RuAzNM is caged by a conjugated azo group, and selectively unleashed in hypoxic cancer cells. This allows emission&#8208;directed multimodal therapy, elicits apoptosis, and suggests that RuAzNM can deliver&#160;an efficacious theranostic outcome for hypoxic cancer cells.








Abstract
Hypoxia represents a remarkably exploitable target for cancer therapy, is encountered only in solid human tumors, and is highly associated with cancer resistance and recurrence. Here, a hypoxia&#8208;activated mitochondria&#8208;accumulated Ru(II) polypyridyl prodrug functionalized with conjugated azo (Az) and nitrogen mustard (NM) functionalities, RuAzNM, is reported. This prodrug has multimodal theranostic properties toward hypoxic cancer cells. Reduction of the azo group in hypoxic cell microenvironments gives rise to the generation of two primary amine products, a free aniline mustard, and the polypyridyl RuNH2 complex. Thus, the aniline mustard triggers generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) and mtDNA crosslinking. Meanwhile, the resultant biologically benign phosphorescent RuNH2 gives rise to a diagnostic signal and signals activation of the phototherapy. This multimodal therapeutic effect eventually elevates ROS levels, depletes reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP), and induces mitochondrial membrane damage, mtDNA damage, and ultimately cell apoptosis. This unique strategy allows controlled multimodal theranostics to be realized in hypoxic cells and multicellular spheroids, making RuAzNM a highly selective and effective cancer&#8208;cell&#8208;selective theranostic agent (IC50&#160;= 2.3&#160;&#181;m for hypoxic HepG2 cancer cells vs 58.2&#160;&#181;m for normoxic THL&#8208;3 normal cells). This is the first report of a metal&#8208;based compound developed as a multimodal theranostic agent for hypoxia.

         <title>Electrostatic Epitaxy of Orientational Perovskites for Microlasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free electrostatic epitaxy is achieved toward orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline microwire arrays and thin films. This is facilitated by a negatively charged surfactant layer at the air&#8211;liquid interface, where the strong and selective interaction between surfactant anion and perovskite facet induces preferential nucleation and orientational growth. The high&#8208;quality microwire permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of photonic lasing, waveguide coupling, and coherent&#8208;light propagation.








Abstract
Orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline structures is pivotal in the semiconductor industry, which is achievable by epitaxy for producing thin films, heterostructures, quantum wells, and superlattices. Beyond silicon and III&#8211;V semiconductors, solution&#8208;processible semiconductors, such as metal&#8208;halide perovskites, are emerging for scalable and cost&#8208;effective manufacture of optoelectronic devices, whereas the polycrystalline nature of fabricated structures restricts their application toward integrated devices. Here, electrostatic epitaxy, a process sustained by strong electrostatic interactions between self&#8208;assembled surfactants (octanoate anions) and Pb2+, is developed to realize orientational growth of single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 microwires. Strong electrostatic interactions localized at the air&#8211;liquid interface not only support preferential nucleation for single crystallinity, but also select the crystal facet with the highest Pb2+ areal density for pure crystallographic orientation. Due to the epitaxy at the air&#8211;liquid interface, direct growth of oriented single&#8208;crystalline microwires onto different substrates without the processes of lift&#8208;off and transfer is realized. Photonic lasing emission, waveguide coupling, and on&#8208;chip propagation of coherent light are demonstrated based on these single&#8208;crystalline microwires. These findings open an avenue for on&#8208;chip integration of single&#8208;crystalline materials.

This study provides &#8220;Mesenchymal&#160;stem&#160;cell&#160;Differentiation&#160;Prediction&#160;(MeD&#8208;P)&#8221;, a machine learning model for predicting hMSCs&#8211;biomaterial interaction. This enables comprehensive evaluation of biomaterials in MSC lineage fate regulation based on RNA&#8208;seq data. MeD&#8208;P is trained to be robust and accurate with large&#8208;scale public RNA&#8208;seq data after correcting for batch variances. It demonstrates much potential in facilitating biological performance optimization of biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.








Abstract
Current functional assessment of biomaterial&#8208;induced stem cell lineage fate in vitro mainly relies on biomarker&#8208;dependent methods with limited accuracy and efficiency. Here a &#8220;Mesenchymal stem cell Differentiation Prediction (MeD&#8208;P)&#8221; framework for biomaterial&#8208;induced cell lineage fate prediction is reported. MeD&#8208;P contains a cell&#8208;type&#8208;specific gene expression profile as a reference by integrating public RNA&#8208;seq data related to tri&#8208;lineage differentiation (osteogenesis, chondrogenesis, and adipogenesis) of human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a predictive model for classifying hMSCs differentiation lineages using the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (kNN) strategy. It is shown that MeD&#8208;P exhibits an overall accuracy of 90.63% on testing datasets, which is significantly higher than the model constructed based on canonical marker genes (80.21%). Moreover, evaluations of multiple biomaterials show that MeD&#8208;P provides accurate prediction of lineage fate on different types of biomaterials as early as the first week of hMSCs culture. In summary, it is demonstrated that MeD&#8208;P is an efficient and accurate strategy for stem cell lineage fate prediction and preliminary biomaterial functional evaluation.

         <title>Iridescence from Total Internal Reflection at 3D Microscale Interfaces: Mechanistic Insights and Spectral Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray tracing coupled with spectral analysis techniques are used to examine the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres. Microstructure arrays with varying orientation and size create unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects with customizable iridescence.








Abstract
An experimental investigation and the optical modeling of the structural coloration produced from total internal reflection interference within 3D microstructures are described. Ray&#8208;tracing simulations coupled with color visualization and spectral analysis techniques are used to model, examine, and rationalize the iridescence generated for a range of microgeometries, including hemicylinders and truncated hemispheres, under varying illumination conditions. An approach to deconstruct the observed iridescence and complex far&#8208;field spectral features into its elementary components and systematically link them to ray trajectories that emanate from the illuminated microstructures is demonstrated. The results are compared with experiments, wherein microstructures are fabricated with methods such as chemical etching, multiphoton lithography, and grayscale lithography. Microstructure arrays patterned on surfaces with varying orientation and size lead to unique color&#8208;traveling optical effects and highlight opportunities for how total internal reflection interference can be used to create customizable reflective iridescence. The findings herein provide a robust conceptual framework for rationalizing this multibounce interference mechanism and establish approaches for characterizing and tailoring the optical and iridescent properties of microstructured surfaces.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Regulation of the Microenvironment of Ni(II)&#8208;Porphyrin Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Efficient Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, p&#8208;NiTPyP) are prepared as model catalysts for fine&#8208;tuning the microenvironment around the active site via affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP as the electrocatalyst delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267/138&#160;mV for the OER/HER, and as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer only requires a cell voltage of 1.62&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 current density.








Abstract
Accurately regulating the microenvironment around active sites is an important approach for boosting the overall water splitting performance of bifunctional electrocatalysts,&#160;which&#160;can drive both the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in the same electrolyte. Herein, pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins (o&#8208;NiTPyP, m&#8208;NiTPyP, and p&#8208;NiTPyP) with pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms located at the ortho&#8208;, meta&#8208;, or para&#8208;position are prepared and used as model catalysts for alkaline water splitting. Experimental and theoretical results reveal that the pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atom positions can regulate the microenvironment around the active sites and the adsorption free energy of H&#8208;donating substances by affecting the H&#8208;bonding interaction and the N&#63743;Ni&#63743;N bond angles of active sites, and thus those pseudo&#8208;pyridine&#8208;substituted Ni(II)&#8208;porphyrins deliver better electrocatalytic activity than the Ni(II)&#8208;tetraphenylporphyrin (NiTPP) without pseudo&#8208;pyridine N&#8208;atoms. Among them, m&#8208;NiTPyP on carbon nanotubes delivers the lowest overpotentials of 267 and 138&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the OER and HER, respectively. Specifically, m&#8208;NiTPyP as bifunctional electrocatalyst in an alkaline electrolyzer requires only 1.62&#160;V to drive efficient overall water splitting at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 while remaining durable. This work proposes a new H&#8208;bond&#8208;regulating approach of the microenvironment of electrocatalysts for effectively boosting the overall water splitting activity and deeply understanding its related mechanism.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Dependent Reversal of Phase Segregation in Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Light&#8208;induced halide segregation is a major barrier to the implementation of mixed&#8208;halide perovskites in tandem solar cells. Increasing temperature from 125&#160;K kinetically enhances halide segregation up to 290&#160;K, but higher temperatures are found to hinder it owing to entropic remixing. Increasing the incident light intensity can also induce remixing, but this effect is transient.








Abstract
Understanding the mechanism of light&#8208;induced halide segregation in mixed&#8208;halide perovskites is essential for their application in multijunction solar cells. Here, photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to uncover how both increases in temperature and light intensity can counteract the halide segregation process. It is observed that, with increasing temperature, halide segregation in CH3NH3Pb(Br0.4I0.6)3 first accelerates toward &#8776;290&#160;K, before slowing down again toward higher temperatures. Such reversal is attributed to the trade&#8208;off between the temperature activation of segregation, for example through enhanced ionic migration, and its inhibition by entropic factors. High light intensities meanwhile can also reverse halide segregation; however, this is found to be only a transient process that abates on the time scale of minutes. Overall, these observations pave the way for a more complete model of halide segregation and aid the development of highly efficient and stable perovskite multijunction and concentrator&#160;photovoltaics.

         <title>Hierarchical Superstructure of Plant Polyphenol and Arginine Surfactant for Long&#8208;Lasting and Target&#8208;Selective Antimicrobial Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A kind of long&#8208;lasting antimicrobial agent with anti&#8208;water washing property and broad substrate adhesion is constructed by bottom&#8211;up assembly from plant polyphenol and amino acid surfactant. The antimicrobial molecules dissociate from the secondary structure of hexagonal column by multi&#8208;stage and on&#8208;demand release to selectively kill the pathogen without generating toxicity and irritation to the normal human tissue.








Abstract
Antimicrobial agents are massively used to disinfect the pathogen contaminated surfaces since the Corona&#160;Virus&#160;Disease&#160;2019&#160;(COVID&#8208;19) outbreak. However, their defects of poor durability, strong irritation, and high environmental accumulation are exposed. Herein, a convenient strategy is developed to fabricate long&#8208;lasting and target&#8208;selective antimicrobial agent with the special hierarchical structure through bottom&#8211;up assembly of natural gallic acid with arginine surfactant. The assembly starts from rodlike micelles, further stacking into hexagonal columns and finally interpenetrating into spherical assemblies, which avoid explosive release of antimicrobial units. The assemblies show anti&#8208;water washing and high adhesion on various surfaces; and thus, possess highly efficient and broad&#8208;spectrum antimicrobial activities even after using up to eleven cycles. Both in vitro and in vivo experiments prove that the assemblies are highly selective in killing pathogens without generating toxicity. The excellent antimicrobial virtues well satisfy the increasing anti&#8208;infection demands and the hierarchical assembly exhibits great potential as a clinical candidate.

         <title>Lead(II) 2&#8208;Ethylhexanoate for Simultaneous Modulated Crystallization and Surface Shielding to Boost Perovskite Solar Cell Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the kinetics of crystallization, resulting in high&#8208;quality perovskite film. The carboxyl functional group coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect concentration. Meanwhile, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices.








Abstract
The bulk and surface of a perovskite light&#8208;harvesting layer are two pivotal aspects affecting its carrier transport and long&#8208;term stability. In this work, lead(II) 2&#8208;ethylhexanoate (LDE) is introduced via an antisolvent process into perovskite films to change the reaction kinetics of the crystallization process, resulting in a high&#8208;quality perovskite film. Meanwhile, a carboxyl functional group with a long alkyl chain coordinates with the Pb cation, reducing the defect density related to unsaturated Pb atoms. Moreover, the long alkyl chains form a protecting layer at the surface of the perovskite film to prevent chemical attack by water and air, prolonging the lifetime of perovskite devices. Consequently, the assembled device demonstrates a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.84%. Both of the thermal and operational stability are significantly improved due to reduced ion&#8208;migration channels.

         <title>Fluorinated Li10GeP2S12 Enables Stable All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12 is achieved by in situ gas&#8208;phase fluoridation. Benefiting from the LiF shell, LiF@Li10GeP2S12 exhibits excellent compatibility toward moisture and lithium metal, realizing a high ionic conductivity after air exposure and three times higher critical current density. The assembled all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery exhibits a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The instability of Li10GeP2S12 toward moisture and that toward lithium metal are two challenges for the application in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries. In this work, Li10GeP2S12 is fluorinated to form a LiF&#8208;coated core&#8211;shell solid electrolyte LiF@Li10GeP2S12. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations confirm the hydrolysis mechanism of Li10GeP2S12 solid electrolyte, including H2O adsorption on Li atoms of Li10GeP2S12 and the subsequent PS43&#8722; dissociation affected by hydrogen bond. The hydrophobic LiF shell can reduce the adsorption site, thus resulting in superior moisture stability when exposing in 30% relative humidity air. Moreover, with LiF shell, Li10GeP2S12 shows one order lower electronic conductivity, which can significantly suppress lithium dendrite growth and reduce the side reaction between Li10GeP2S12 and lithium, realizing three times higher critical current density to 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The assembled LiNbO3@LiCoO2/LiF@Li10GeP2S12/Li battery exhibits an initial discharge capacity of 101.0 mAh g&#8722;1 with a capacity retention of 94.8% after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Genetically Programmable Vesicles for Enhancing CAR&#8208;T Therapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and improve the infiltration and effector functions of chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cells. The combination of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs with CAR&#8208;T cells increases the therapeutic effect against orthotopic lung cancer and generates a long&#8208;term immune memory response.








Abstract
Chimeric antigen receptor&#8208;T (CAR&#8208;T) cell therapy has shown remarkable success in eradicating hematologic malignancies; however, its efficacy in treating solid tumors has always been limited due to the presence of an immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Here, genetically programmable cellular vesicles expressing high&#8208;affinity anti&#8208;programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 single chain variable fragment (anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;scFv) loaded with glutamine antagonist (D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs) are developed to metabolically dismantle the immunosuppressive TME and enhance the efficiency of anti&#8208;mesothelin CAR&#8208;T cells in orthotopic lung cancer. As anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 scFv can specifically bind to the programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) on tumor cells, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs enable the targeted delivery of glutamine antagonists to the tumor site and address the upregulation of PD&#8208;L1 on tumor cells, which prevents the premature exhaustion of CAR&#8208;T cells. More importantly, D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs effectively reduce the number of immunosuppressive cells and promote the recruitment of inflammatory cells and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines in tumor tissues. These unique features of D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs improve the infiltration and effector functions of CAR&#8208;T cells, which ultimately enhance the anti&#8208;tumor ability and long&#8208;term memory immunity of CAR&#8208;T cells. The findings support that D@aPD&#8208;L1 NVs act as a promising drug to strengthen the effectiveness of CAR&#8208;T cells against solid tumors.

2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets are synthesized. The outstanding optical properties can be well explained by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectroscopy study and first&#8208;principal density functional theory calculations. The as&#8208;prepared alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets exhibit unprecedent stability toward air and polar solvents. All&#8208;solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;emitting diodes using this material as the sole emitting layer are successfully fabricated.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free double perovskites have emerged as a promising class of materials with potential to be integrated into a wide range of optical and optoelectronic applications. Herein, the first synthesis of 2D Cs2AgInxBi1&#8208;xCl6 (0 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 1) alloyed double perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) with well controlled morphology and composition is demonstrated. The obtained NPLs show unique optical properties with the highest photoluminescence quantum yield of 40.1%. Both temperature dependent spectroscopic studies and density functional theory calculation results reveal that the morphological dimension reduction and In&#8211;Bi alloying effect together boost the radiative pathway of the self&#8208;trapped excitons of the alloyed double perovskite NPLs. Moreover, the NPLs exhibit good stability under ambient conditions and against polar solvents, which is ideal for all solution&#8208;processing of the materials in low&#8208;cost device manufacturing. The first solution&#8208;processed light&#8208;emitting diodes is demonstrated using the Cs2AgIn0.9Bi0.1Cl6 alloyed double perovskite NPLs as the sole emitting component, showing luminance maximum of 58&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and peak current efficiency of 0.013&#160;cd A&#8722;1. This study sheds light on morphological control and composition&#8208;property relationships of double perovskite nanocrystals, paving the way toward ultimate utilizations of lead&#8208;free perovskite materials in diverse sets of real&#8208;life applications.

Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detections.

Abstract
Detection of biomarkers associated with wound conditions provides in&#8208;depth healthcare information and benefits wound healing treatment. The current aim of wound detection is to achieve in situ multiple detections. Novel encoded structural color microneedle patches (EMNs) combining photonic crystals (PhCs) and microneedle arrays (MNs) for multiple wound biomarker detection in situ are described here. Using a partitioned and layered casting strategy, the EMNs can be divided into different modules and each serves for the detection of small molecules , including pH, glucose, and histamine. pH sensing is based on the interaction between hydrogen ions and carboxyl groups from hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (PAM); glucose sensing is achieved with the help of glucose&#8208;responsive fluorophenylboronic acid (FPBA); while histamine sensing relies on specific recognition of aptamers and target molecules. Owing to the responsive volume change of these three modules in the presence of target molecules, the EMNs can create structural color change and characteristic peak shift of the PhCs, thus realizing the qualitative measurement of target molecules with a spectrum analyzer. It is further demonstrated that the EMNs behave well in the multivariate detection of rat wound molecules. These features indicate that the EMNs can be valuable smart detection systems for wound status screening.

         <title>A Superconducting Micro&#8208;Magnetometer for Quantum Vortex in Superconducting Nanoflakes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superconducting quantum interferometer devices are important in investigating magnetic properties in quantum materials, but cannot probe micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Based on the superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer, the density of vortex pinning centers in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 nanoflake can be determined as 1.1 &#215; 1012 m&#8722;2. This superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer sheds light on the detection of small magnetic signals of nanoflakes.








Abstract
Superconducting quantum interferometer device (SQUID) plays a key role in understanding electromagnetic properties and emergent phenomena in quantum materials. The technological appeal of SQUID is that its detection accuracy for the electromagnetic signal can precisely reach the quantum level of a single magnetic flux. However, conventional SQUID techniques normally can only be applied to a bulky sample and do not have the capability to probe the magnetic properties of micro&#8208;scale samples with small magnetic signals. Herein, it is demonstrated that, based on a specially designed superconducting nano&#8208;hole array, the contactless detection of magnetic properties and quantized vortices in micro&#8208;sized superconducting nanoflakes is realized. An anomalous hysteresis loop and a suppression of Little&#8211;Parks oscillation are observed in the detected magnetoresistance signal, which originates from the disordered distribution of the pinned vortices in Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+&#948;. Therefore, the density of pinning centers of the quantized vortices on such micro&#8208;sized superconducting samples can be quantitatively evaluated, which is technically inaccessible for conventional SQUID detection. The superconducting micro&#8208;magnetometer provides a new approach to exploring mesoscopic electromagnetic phenomena of quantum materials.

         <title>The First Demonstration of Strain&#8208;Controlled Periodic Ferroelectric Domains with Superior Piezoelectric Response in Molecular Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By applying tensile strain to the thin film of molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3), a large area of highly ordered periodic domain structures can be obtained. The density and width of these periodic domains can be adjusted by the magnitude of strain and the thickness of the film, respectively, and the piezoelectric response at the domain wall is enhanced.








Abstract
Achieving a periodic domain structure in ferroelectric materials to tailor the macroscopic properties or realize new functions has always been a hot topic. However, methods to construct periodic domain structures, such as epitaxial growth, direct writing by scanning tips, and the patterned electrode method, are difficult or inefficient to implement in emerging molecular ferroelectrics, which have the advantages of lightweight, flexibility, biocompatibility, etc. An efficient method for constructing and controlling periodic domain structures is urgently needed to facilitate the development of molecular ferroelectrics in nanoelectronic devices. In this work, it is demonstrated that large&#8208;area, periodic and controllable needle&#8208;like domain structures can be achieved in thin films of the molecular ferroelectric trimethylchloromethyl ammonium trichlorocadmium (TMCM&#8208;CdCl3) upon the application of tensile strain. The domain evolution under various tensile strains can be clearly observed, and such processes are accordingly identified. Furthermore, the domain wall exhibits a superior piezoelectric response, with up to fivefold enhancement compared to that of the pristine samples. Such large&#8208;area tunable periodic domain structure and abnormally strong piezoresponse are not only of great interests in fundamental studies, but also highly important in the future applications in functional molecular materials.

         <title>The Emerging Layered Hydroxide Plates with Record Thickness for Enhanced High&#8208;Mass&#8208;Loading Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>

With the NH4+ and F&#8722; synergy mechanism, the intrinsic growth limit of &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 is broken,&#160;realizing record&#8208;level thickness (over 700&#160;nm) for the tailored F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) superstructure. The ultrathick plate superstructure is found to have a versatile family, which can open a new era of novel energy&#8208;storage materials to meet various future demands.








Abstract
The past decade has witnessed the development of layered&#8208;hydroxide&#8208;based self&#8208;supporting electrodes, but the low active mass ratio impedes its all&#8208;around energy&#8208;storage applications. Herein, the intrinsic limit of layered hydroxides is broken by engineering F&#8208;substituted &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 (Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH) plates with a sub&#8208;micrometer thickness (over 700&#160;nm), producing a superhigh mass loading of 29.8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 on the carbon substrate. Theoretical calculation and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that Ni&#8211;F&#8211;OH shares the &#946;&#8208;Ni(OH)2&#8208;like structure with slightly tuned lattice parameters. More interestingly, the synergy modulation of NH4+ and F&#8722; is found to serve as the key enabler to tailor these sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thickness 2D plates thanks to the modification effects on the (001) plane surface energy and local OH&#8722; concentration. Guided by this mechanism, the superstructures of bimetallic hydroxides and their derivatives are further developed, revealing they are a versatile family with great promise. The tailored ultrathick phosphide superstructure achieves a superhigh specific capacity of 7144 mC cm&#8722;2 and a superior rate capability (79% at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). This work highlights a multiscale understanding of how exceptional structure modulation happens in low&#8208;dimensional layered materials. The as&#8208;built unique methodology and mechanisms will boost the development of advanced materials to better meet future energy demands.

         <title>Van der Waals Epitaxy Growth of 2D Single&#8208;Element Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of 2D single&#8208;element cobalt nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated for the first time, which is guaranteed by the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit significant in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy and magnetoresistance effects, opening up exciting opportunities for the exploration of 2D single&#8208;element magnetism.








Abstract
2D single&#8208;element materials, which are pure and intrinsically homogeneous on the nanometer scale, can cut the time&#8208;consuming material&#8208;optimization process and circumvent the impure phase, bringing about opportunities to explore new physics and applications. Herein, for the first time, the synthesis of ultrathin cobalt single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets with a sub&#8208;millimeter scale via van der Waals epitaxy is demonstrated. The thickness can be as low as &#8776;6&#160;nm. Theoretical calculations reveal their intrinsic ferromagnetic nature and epitaxial mechanism: that is, the synergistic effect between van der Waals interactions and surface energy minimization dominates the growth process. Cobalt nanosheets exhibit ultrahigh&#160;blocking temperatures above 710 K and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy. Electrical transport measurements further reveal that cobalt nanosheets have significant magnetoresistance (MR) effect, and can realize a unique coexistence of positive MR and negative MR under different magnetic field configurations, which can be attributed to the competition and cooperation effect among ferromagnetic interaction, orbital scattering, and electronic correlation. These results provide a valuable case for synthesizing 2D elementary metal crystals with pure phase and room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and pave the way for investigating new physics and related applications in spintronics.

         <title>Quantifiable Relationship Between Antibacterial Efficacy and Electro&#8211;Mechanical Intervention on Nanowire Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quantifiable relationship between biophysical force and antibacterial efficiency is demonstrated. Electrical interactions not only supplement mechanical damage by accentuating the electrostatic attraction between the bacteria and implant surface, but also facilitate electron flow from the bacteria to the materials to boost production of intracellular reactive oxygen species. This principle aids the development of non&#8208;leaching antibacterial implant materials with clinical significance.








Abstract
Physical disruption is an important antibacterial means as it is lethal to bacteria without spurring antimicrobial resistance. However, it is very challenging to establish a quantifiable relationship between antibacterial efficacy and physical interactions such as mechanical and electrical forces. Herein, titanium nitride (TN) nanowires with adjustable orientations and capacitances are prepared to exert gradient electro&#8211;mechanical forces on bacteria. While vertical nanowires show the strongest mechanical force resulting in an antibacterial efficiency of 0.62 log reduction (vs 0.22 for tiled and 0.36 for inclined nanowires, respectively), the addition of electrical charges maximizes the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions and elevates the antibacterial efficacy to more than 3 log reduction. Biophysical and biochemical analyses indicate that electrostatic attraction by electrical charge narrows the interface. The electro&#8211;mechanical intervention more easily stiffens and rips the bacteria membrane, disturbing the electron balance and generating intracellular oxidative stress. The antibacterial ability is maintained in vivo and bacteria&#8208;challenged rats are protected from serious infection. The physical bacteria&#8208;killing process demonstrated here can be controlled by adjusting the electro&#8211;mechanical interactions. Overall, these results revealed important principles for rationally designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces for clinical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Scanning Second&#8208;Harmonic&#8208;Generation Microscopy for Polar Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed. The microscope&#160;is capable of rapidly screening high&#8208;throughput polar materials without common artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, and is successfully applied to compositional&#8208;gradient as well as thickness&#8208;gradient polar materials to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities.








Abstract
The Materials Genome Initiative aims to discover, develop, manufacture, and deploy advanced materials at twice the speed of conventional approaches. To achieve this, high&#8208;throughput characterization is essential for the rapid screening of candidate materials. In this study, a high&#8208;throughput scanning second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation microscope with automatic partitioning, accurate positioning, and fast scanning is developed that can rapidly probe and screen polar materials. Using this technique, typical ferroelectrics, including periodically poled lithium niobate crystals and PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) thin films are first investigated, whereby the microscopic domain structures are clearly revealed. This technique is then applied to a compositional&#8208;gradient (100&#8722;x)%BaTiO3&#8722;x%SrTiO3 film and a thickness&#8208;gradient PZT film to demonstrate its high&#8208;throughput capabilities. Since the second&#8208;harmonic&#8208;generation signal is correlated with the macroscopic remnant polarization over the probed region determined by the laser spot, it is free of artifacts arising from leakage current and electrostatic interference, while materials&#8217; symmetries and domain structures must be carefully considered in the data analysis. It is believed that this work can help promote the high&#8208;throughput development of polar materials and contribute to the Materials Genome Initiative.

         <title>Doping by Design: Enhanced Thermoelectric Performance of GeSe Alloys Through Metavalent Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A common denominator for successful dopants of GeSe is revealed, which is related to metavalent bonding. These dopants can simply be identified in a chemical bonding map. The metavalently bonded GeSe shows strong lattice anharmonicity, a low band effective mass, and a large Fermi surface complexity factor, leading to significantly improved thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Doping is usually the first step to tailor thermoelectrics. It enables precise control of the charge&#8208;carrier concentration and concomitant transport properties. Doping should also turn GeSe, which features an intrinsically a low carrier concentration, into a competitive thermoelectric. Yet, elemental doping fails to improve the carrier concentration. In contrast, alloying with Ag&#8211;V&#8211;VI2 compounds causes a remarkable enhancement of thermoelectric performance. This advance is closely related to a transition in the bonding mechanism, as evidenced by sudden changes in the optical dielectric constant &#949;&#8734;, the Born effective charge, the maximum of the optical absorption &#949;2(&#969;), and the bond&#8208;breaking behavior. These property changes are indicative of the formation of metavalent bonding (MVB), leading to an octahedral&#8208;like atomic arrangement. MVB is accompanied by a thermoelectric&#8208;favorable band structure featuring anisotropic bands with small effective masses and a large degeneracy. A quantum&#8208;mechanical map, which distinguishes different types of chemical bonding, reveals that orthorhombic GeSe employs covalent bonding, while rhombohedral and cubic GeSe utilize MVB. The transition from covalent to MVB goes along with a pronounced improvement in thermoelectric performance. The failure or success of different dopants can be explained by this concept, which redefines doping rules and provides a &#8220;treasure map&#8221; to tailor p&#8208;bonded chalcogenides.

         <title>Lithium&#8208;Induced Optimization Mechanism for an Ultrathin&#8208;Strut Biodegradable Zn&#8208;Based Vascular Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) design in durable metallic vascular stents remains challengeable in biodegradable scaffolds. In this work, a zinc&#8208;based scaffold with a 65&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick strut and adequate radial force isn achieved via introducing trace amounts of lithium (Li). The scaffold's ultrafine microstructure, which contains nanoscale Li&#8208;containing phases, alters its biodegradable behavior and enhances its biofunction for vessel healing.








Abstract
To reduce incidences of in&#8208;stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner&#8208;strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is toward the use of ultrathin&#8208;strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts.

     alt="Lithium-Induced Optimization Mechanism for an Ultrathin-Strut Biodegradable Zn-Based Vascular Scaffold"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An ultrathin-strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) design in durable metallic vascular stents remains challengeable in biodegradable scaffolds. In this work, a zinc-based scaffold with a 65&#160;&#181;m-thick strut and adequate radial force isn achieved via introducing trace amounts of lithium (Li). The scaffold's ultrafine microstructure, which contains nanoscale Li-containing phases, alters its biodegradable behavior and enhances its biofunction for vessel healing.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To reduce incidences of in-stent restenosis and thrombosis, the use of a thinner-strut stent has been clinically proven to be effective. Therefore, the contemporary trend is toward the use of ultrathin-strut (&#8804;70&#160;&#181;m) designs for durable stents. However, stents made from biodegradable platforms have failed to achieve intergenerational breakthroughs due to their excessively thick struts. Here, microalloying is used to create an ultrathin-strut (65&#160;&#181;m) zinc (Zn) scaffold with modified biodegradation behavior and improved biofunction, by adding lithium (Li). The scaffold backbone consists of an ultrafine-grained Zn matrix (average grain diameter 2.28&#160;&#181;m) with uniformly distributed nanoscale Li-containing phases. Grain refinement and precipitation strengthening enable it to achieve twice the radial strength with only 40% of the strut thickness of the pure Zn scaffold. Adding Li alters the thermodynamic formation pathways of products during scaffold biodegradation, creating an alkaline microenvironment. Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;may actively stabilize this microenvironment due to its higher solubility and better buffering capability than Zn products. The co-release of ionic zinc and lithium enhances the beneficial differential effects on activities of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells, resulting in good endothelialization and limited intimal hyperplasia in porcine coronary arteries. The findings here may break the predicament of the next-generation biodegradable scaffolds.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Supporting Trimetallic Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks on S/N&#8208;Doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>

Trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over the hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) are prepared as a promising electrocatalyst for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating active sites exposure, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers excellent OER performance with an overpotential of 296&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and outstanding durability.








Abstract
Hybrid materials, integrating the merits of individual components, are ideal structures for efficient oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, the rational construction of hybrid structures with decent physical/electrochemical properties is yet challenging. Herein, a promising OER electrocatalyst composed of trimetallic metal&#8208;organic frameworks supported over S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF) via a cation&#8208;exchange strategy is delicately fabricated. Benefiting from the trimetallic composition with improved intrinsic activity, hollow S/N&#8208;CMF matrix facilitating exposure of active sites, as well as their robust integration, the resultant S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF electrocatalyst delivers outstanding activity and stability for alkaline OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 296&#160;mV to reach the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 53.5&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. In combination with X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, the post&#8208;formed Fe/Co&#8208;doped &#947;&#8208;NiOOH during the OER operation is revealed to account for the high OER performance of S/N&#8208;CMF@FexCoyNi1&#8208;x&#8208;y&#8208;MOF.

         <title>Anion&#8208;Incorporated Mg&#8208;Ion Solvation Modulation Enables Fast Magnesium Storage Kinetics of Conversion&#8208;Type Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The as&#8208;prepared copper selenide cathode achieved a more than twofold capacity increase at a high rate and the highest reversible capacities compared to those of the previously reported metal selenide cathodes.








Abstract
Rechargeable magnesium batteries (RMB) have emerged as one of the most promising alternatives to lithium&#8208;ion batteries due to the prominent advantages of magnesium metal anodes. Nevertheless, their application is hindered by sluggish Mg&#8208;ion storage kinetics in cathodes, although various structural modifications of cathode materials have been performed. Herein, an electrolyte design using an anion&#8208;incorporated Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure is developed to promote the Mg&#8208;ion storage reactions of conversion&#8208;type cathode materials. The addition of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion (OTf&#8722;) in the ether&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte modulates the solvation structure of Mg2+ from [Mg(DME)3]2+ to [Mg(DME)2.5OTf]+ (DME = dimethoxy ethane), which facilitates Mg&#8208;ion desolvation and thus significantly expedites the charge transfer of the cathode material. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared CuSe cathode material on copper current collector exhibits a considerable increase in magnesium storage capacity from 61% (228 mAh g&#8208;1) to 95% (357 mAh g&#8208;1) of the theoretical capacity at 0.1 A g&#8208;1 and a more than twofold capacity increase at a high current density of 1.0 A g&#8208;1. This work provides an efficient strategy via electrolyte modulation to achieve high&#8208;rate conversion&#8208;type cathode materials for RMBs. The incorporation of the trifluoromethanesulfonate anion in the Mg&#8208;ion solvation structure of the borate&#8208;based Mg&#8208;ion electrolyte enables the fast magnesium storage kinetics of the conversion&#8208;type cathode materials.

         <title>Multileveled Hierarchical Hydrogel with Continuous Biophysical and Biochemical Gradients for Enhanced Repair of Full&#8208;Thickness Osteochondral Defect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multileveled continuous gradient hydrogel is developed by inserting gradedly distributed MagHA, mechanical, and magnetism gradients simultaneously in double&#8208;network (DN) hydrogel via a brief exposure of a magneto field using the computed and optimized parameter. Such gradient hierarchically triggers bi&#8208;directional (cartilage&#8208;subchondral bone) differentiation and extracellular matrix (ECM) rearrangement to repair full&#8208;thickness osteochondral tissue.








Abstract
The repair of hierarchical osteochondral defect requires sophisticated gradient reestablishment; however, few strategies for continuous gradient casting consider the relevance to clinical practice regarding cell adaptability, multiple gradient elements, and precise gradient mirroring native tissue. Here, a hydrogel with continuous gradients in nano&#8208;hydroxyapatite (HA) content, mechanical, and magnetism is developed using synthesized superparamagnetic HA nanorods (MagHA) that easily respond to a brief magnetic field. To precisely reconstruct osteochondral tissue, the optimized gradient mode is calculated according to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of healthy rabbit knees. Then, MagHA are patterned to form continuous biophysical and biochemical gradients, consequently generating incremental HA, mechanical, and electromagnetic cues under an external magnetic stimulus. To make such depth&#8208;dependent biocues work, an adaptable hydrogel is developed to facilitate cell infiltration. Furthermore, this approach is applied in rabbit full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects equipped with a local magnetic field. Surprisingly, this multileveled gradient composite hydrogel repairs osteochondral unit in a perfect heterogeneous feature, which mimics the gradual cartilage&#8208;to&#8208;subchondral transition. Collectively, this is the first study that combines an adaptable hydrogel with magneto&#8208;driven MagHA gradients to achieve promising outcomes in osteochondral regeneration.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 nanosheets serve as the general platform to significantly advance the photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductors, such as TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. The outstanding activity is attributed to the existence of abundant Re/Se active sites and strongly coupled interface between atomic&#8208;level regulated ReSe2 and the semiconductor photocatalyst.








Abstract
Solar hydrogen (H2) generation via photocatalytic water splitting is practically promising, environmentally benign, and sustainably carbon neutral. It is important therefore to understand how to controllably engineer photocatalysts at the atomic level. In this work, atomic&#8208;level engineering of defected ReSe2 nanosheets (NSs) is reported to significantly boost photocatalytic H2 evolution on various semiconductor photocatalysts including TiO2, CdS, ZnIn2S4, and C3N4. Advanced characterizations, such as atomic&#8208;resolution aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy (AC&#8208;STEM), synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES), in situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), transient&#8208;state surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy, and transient&#8208;state photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy, together with theoretical computations confirm that the strongly coupled ReSe2/TiO2 interface and substantial atomic&#8208;level active sites of defected ReSe2 NSs result in the significantly raised activity of ReSe2/TiO2. This work not only for the first time realizes the atomic&#8208;level engineering of ReSe2 NSs as a versatile platform to significantly raise the activities on different photocatalysts, but, more importantly, underscores the immense importance of atomic&#8208;level synthesis and exploration on 2D materials for energy conversion and storage.

         <title>Ethanol&#8208;Induced Ni2+&#8208;Intercalated Cobalt Organic Frameworks on Vanadium Pentoxide for Synergistically Enhancing the Performance of 3D&#8208;Printed Micro&#8208;Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>

The hollow structure is synthesized by controlling the amount of Ni doping by using the different coordination abilities of Ni2+ and Co2+ with N and O atoms and the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the 3D structure of ZIF&#8208;67. The composite material applied to 3D printing micro supercapacitor has excellent specific capacitance and energy density.








Abstract
The synthesis of metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocomposites with high energy density and excellent mechanical strength is limited by the degree of lattice matching and crystal surface structure. In this study, dodecahedral ZIF&#8208;67 is synthesized uniformly on vanadium pentoxide nanowires. The influence of the coordination mode on the surface of ZIF&#8208;67 in ethanol is also investigated. Benefitting from the different coordination abilities of Ni2+, Co2+, and N atoms, spatially separated surface&#8208;active sites are created through metal&#8208;ion exchange. Furthermore, the incompatibility between the d8 electronic configuration of Ni2+ and the three&#8208;dimensional (3D) structure of ZIF&#8208;67 afforded the synthesis of hollow structures by controlling the amount of Ni doping. The formation of NiCo&#8208;MOF@CoOOH@V2O5 nanocomposites is confirmed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis. The high performance of the obtained composite is illustrated by fabricating a 3D&#8208;printed micro&#8208;supercapacitor, exhibiting a high area specific capacitance of 585 mF cm&#8722;2 and energy density of 159.23 &#181;Wh cm&#8722;2 (at power density = 0.34&#160;mW cm&#8722;2). The solvent/coordination tuning strategy demonstrated in this study provides a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance nanomaterials for electrochemical energy storage applications.

         <title>Fibro&#8208;Gel: An All&#8208;Aqueous Hydrogel Consisting of Microfibers with Tunable Release Profile and its Application in Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable fibro&#8208;gel with controllable physicochemical properties and tunable drug release rates is demonstrated. The release of distinct drugs at different rates from fibro&#8208;gels can accelerate wound healing with high efficiency. These properties enable precise tailoring of the fibro&#8208;gel for potential applications, such as in situ tissue engineering.








Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are valuable tools in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine due to their unique advantages of injectability with minimal invasiveness and usability for irregularly shaped sites. However, it remains challenging to achieve scalable manufacturing together with matching physicochemical properties and on&#8208;demand drug release for a high level of control over biophysical and biomedical cues to direct endogenous cells. Here, the use of an injectable fibro&#8208;gel is demonstrated, a water&#8208;filled network of entangled hydrogel microfibers, whose physicochemical properties and drug release profiles can be tailored to overcome these shortcomings. This fibro&#8208;gel exhibits favorable in vitro biocompatibility and the capability to aid vascularization. The potential use of the fibro&#8208;gel for advancing tissue regeneration is explored with a mice excision skin model. Preliminary in vivo tests indicate that the fibro&#8208;gel promotes wound healing and new healthy tissue regeneration at a faster rate than a commercial gel. Moreover, it is demonstrated that the release of distinct drugs at different rates can further accelerate wound healing with higher efficiency, by using a two&#8208;layer fibro&#8208;gel model. The combination of injectability and tailorable properties of this fibro&#8208;gel offers a promising approach in biomedical fields such as therapeutic delivery, medical dressings, and 3D tissue scaffolds for tissue engineering.

         <title>2D Nano&#8208;Sonosensitizers Facilitate Energy Transfer to Enhance Sonodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D metal&#8211;organic nano&#8208;sonosensitizers are constructed from photosensitizing iridium&#8208;based linkers and surface&#8208;anchored porphyrin sonosensitizers to absorb high&#8208; and low&#8208;energy regions of sonoluminescence, respectively. The excited iridium&#8208;based linkers undergo triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer to porphyrin sonosensitizers for efficient singlet oxygen generation, leading to greatly enhanced sonodynamic therapy efficacy over free sonosensitizers in mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer.








Abstract
Although sonodynamic therapy (SDT) has shown promise for cancer treatment, the lack of efficient sonosensitizers (SSs) has limited the clinical application of SDT. Here, a new strategy is reported for designing efficient nano&#8208;sonosensitizers based on 2D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic layers (MOLs). Composed of Hf&#8208;oxo secondary building units (SBUs) and iridium&#8208;based linkers, the MOL is anchored with 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetra(p&#8208;benzoato)porphyrin (TBP) sensitizers on the SBUs to afford TBP@MOL. TBP@MOL shows 14.1&#8208; and 7.4&#8208;fold higher singlet oxygen (1O2) generation than free TBP ligands and Hf&#8208;TBP, a 3D nanoscale metal&#8211;organic framework, respectively. The 1O2 generation of TBP@MOL is enhanced by isolating TBP SSs on the SBUs of the MOL, which prevents&#160;aggregation&#8208;induced quenching of the excited sensitizers, and by triplet&#8211;triplet Dexter energy transfer between excited iridium&#8208;based linkers and TBP SSs, which more efficiently harnesses broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence. Anchoring TBP on the MOL surface also enhances the energy transfer between the excited sensitizer and ground&#8208;state triplet oxygen to increase 1O2 generation efficacy. In mouse models of colorectal and breast cancer, TBP@MOL demonstrates significantly higher SDT efficacy than Hf&#8208;TBP and TBP. This work uncovers a new strategy to design effective nano&#8208;sonosensitizers by facilitating energy transfer to efficiently capture broad&#8208;spectrum sonoluminescence and enhance 1O2 generation.

         <title>A Whole&#8208;Course&#8208;Repair System Based on Neurogenesis&#8208;Angiogenesis Crosstalk and Macrophage Reprogramming Promotes Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combined neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis crosstalk and macrophage reprogramming can pave way for the next generation of regenerative hydrogels to accelerate the recovery of chronic wounds. The work presents a novel approach to deliver drug&#8208;loaded extracellular vesicles and magnesium ions by an in situ injectable hydrogel for concurrent supportive cycles of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment to heal diabetic wounds.








Abstract
Diabetic wound (DW) therapy is currently a big challenge in medicine and strategies to enhance neurogenesis and angiogenesis have appeared to be a promising direction. However, the current treatments have failed to coordinate neurogenesis and angiogenesis simultaneously, leading to an increased disability rate caused by DWs. Herein, a whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system is introduced by a hydrogel to concurrently achieve a mutually supportive cycle of neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis under a favorable immune&#8208;microenvironment. This hydrogel can first be one&#8208;step packaged in a syringe for later in situ local injections to cover wounds long&#8208;termly for accelerated wound healing via the synergistic effect of magnesium ions (Mg2+) and engineered small extracellular vesicles (sEVs). The self&#8208;healing and bio&#8208;adhesive properties of the hydrogel make it an ideal physical barrier for DWs. At the inflammation stage, the formulation can recruit bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells to the wound sites and stimulate them toward neurogenic differentiation, while providing a favorable immune microenvironment via macrophage reprogramming. At the proliferation stage of wound repair, robust angiogenesis occurs by the synergistic effect of the newly differentiated neural cells and the released Mg2+, allowing a regenerative neurogenesis&#8208;angiogenesis cycle to take place at the wound site. This whole&#8208;course&#8208;repair system provides a novel platform for combined DW therapy.

Multiplexed Cell Capture
Harvesting cells from biomaterials for downstream analysis without perturbing their state represents an outstanding challenge in 3D/4D culture and tissue engineering. In article number 2209904, Cole A. DeForest and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that engineered sortase transpeptidases can be used to selectively degrade and recover single&#8208;cell suspensions from specific subvolumes of hydrogel multimaterials, permitting multiplexed cell capture with largely &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; cues.

Jellybean Quantum Dots
Highly elliptical, elongated, quantum dots&#8212;so&#8208;called jellybean quantum dots&#8212;can be used for qubit&#8211;qubit coupling over short&#8208;to&#8208;intermediate distances and alleviate crowding in scaled&#8208;up quantum processors, as described by Zeheng Wang, Arne Laucht, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2208557. The cover illustration shows an artist's impression of two spin qubits in silicon metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor quantum dots that are coupled through such a jellybean coupler.

Exotic Superconductivity
In article number 2207841, Fucong Fei, Zhicheng Zhong, Fengqi Song, Xuefeng Wang, and co&#8208;workers report boosted superconductivity with a transition temperature of about 7.5 K in Ta&#8208;doped MoTe2 single crystals under ambient pressure. An enhanced upper critical field beyond the Pauli limit is also observed in Ta&#8208;doped Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;MoTe2, which is likely due to the mixed singlet&#8211;triplet superconductivity.

Antibacterial Surfaces
In article number 2212315, Guomin Wang, Kaiwei Tang, Jianzhong Du, Paul K. Chu, and co&#8208;workers report a titanium nitride nanowire coating synthesized by a liquid&#8208;phase oxidation process and nitridation. The charged surfaces kill bacteria by exerting electro&#8211;mechanical forces, piercing the bacterial membrane and disturbing the electron balance. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance antibacterial interfaces with clinical applications.

Volumetric 3D Printing
In volumetric 3D printing, the whole 3D object is developed simultaneously (i.e., volume&#8208;at&#8208;once) by means of light&#8208;induced crosslinking of a (rotating) liquid resin, as reported by Sandra Van Vlierberghe and co&#8208;workers in article number 2210136. The 3D&#8208;structure illustrated in the image is based on the chemical network structure of the reported thiol&#8211;ene crosslinked poly(caprolactone) (PCL) network, which can be considered a homogeneous 3D network consisting of telechelic alkene&#8208;functionalized PCL and tetra&#8208;functional thiol crosslinker junctions.

         <title>Artificial Muscles and Soft Robotic Devices for Treatment of End&#8208;Stage Heart Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the present state and future direction of soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart, focusing on electrothermally artificial heart muscles. The current state of the ventricular assist devices and the key factors for the development of a full soft robotic ventricular assist device were discussed.








Abstract
Medical soft robotics constitutes a rapidly developing field in the treatment of cardiovascular diseases, with a promising future for millions of patients suffering from heart failure worldwide. Herein, the present state and future direction of artificial muscle&#8208;based soft robotic biomedical devices in supporting the inotropic function of the heart are reviewed, focusing on the emerging electrothermally artificial heart muscles (AHMs). Artificial muscle powered soft robotic devices can mimic the action of complex biological systems such as heart compression and twisting. These artificial muscles possess the ability to undergo complex deformations, aiding cardiac function while maintaining a limited weight and use of space. Two very promising candidates for artificial muscles are electrothermally actuated AHMs and biohybrid actuators using living cells or tissue embedded with artificial structures. Electrothermally actuated AHMs have demonstrated superior force generation while creating the prospect for fully soft robotic actuated ventricular assist devices. This review will critically analyze the limitations of currently available devices and discuss opportunities and directions for future research. Last, the properties of the cardiac muscle are reviewed and compared with those of different materials suitable for mechanical cardiac compression.

         <title>Shaping a Soft Future: Patterning Liquid Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shaping liquid metals down to the sub&#8208;micrometer scale has enabled a wide range of novel soft and stretchable devices. This review highlights patterning techniques such as injection/vacuum filling, direct ink writing, selective adhesion, and stenciling. Applications are highlighted, followed by a summary of present&#8208;day challenges and opportunities for future development.








Abstract
This review highlights the unique techniques for patterning liquid metals containing gallium (e.g., eutectic gallium indium, EGaIn). These techniques are enabled by two unique attributes of these liquids relative to solid metals: 1) The fluidity of the metal allows it to be injected, sprayed, and generally dispensed. 2) The solid native oxide shell allows the metal to adhere to surfaces and be shaped in ways that would normally be prohibited due to surface tension. The ability to shape liquid metals into non&#8208;spherical structures such as wires, antennas, and electrodes can enable fluidic metallic conductors for stretchable electronics, soft robotics, e&#8208;skins, and wearables. The key properties of these metals with a focus on methods to pattern liquid metals into soft or stretchable devices are summari.

         <title>Manganese&#8208;Based Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 19, May 11, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese&#8208;based nanomaterials have unique features to be used in tumor traceable immunotherapy in the form of nanocarriers, immunomodulators, and immunoactivators. This review focuses on the recent progress of Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy. It is highly anticipated that Mn&#8208;based immunotherapy can open up a promising avenue in nanomedicine.








Abstract
As an essential micronutrient, manganese (Mn) participates in various physiological processes and plays important roles in host immune system, hematopoiesis, endocrine function, and oxidative stress regulation. Mn&#8208;based nanoparticles are considered to be biocompatible and show versatile applications in nanomedicine, in particular utilized in tumor immunotherapy in the following ways: 1) acting as a biocompatible nanocarrier to deliver immunotherapeutic agents for tumor immunotherapy; 2) serving as an adjuvant to regulate tumor immune microenvironment and enhance immunotherapy; 3) activating host's immune system through the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway to trigger tumor immunotherapy; 4) real&#8208;time monitoring tumor immunotherapy effect by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) since Mn2+ ions are ideal MRI contrast agent which can significantly enhance the T1&#8208;weighted MRI signal after binding to proteins. This comprehensive review focuses on the most recent progress of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms in tumor immunotherapy. The characteristics of Mn are first discussed to guide the design of Mn&#8208;based multifunctional nanoplatforms. Then the biomedical applications of Mn&#8208;based nanoplatforms, including immunotherapy alone, immunotherapy&#8208;involved multimodal synergistic therapy, and imaging&#8208;guided immunotherapy are discussed in detail. Finally, the challenges and future developments of Mn&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy are highlighted.

Recent advances on lactate oxidase (LOx)&#8208;based biosensors are summarized, including hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)&#8208;based, oxygen (O2)2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical, for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies, including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy, are discussed.








Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on l&#8208;lactate; its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate&#8208;depletion&#8208;based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia&#8208;activated chemotherapy, H2O2&#8208;based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

This review provides a timely summary of the current progress on inorganic solid&#8208;state electrolyte&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, analyzes their technical challenges, and outlines future research targets for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin SSE membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. This review looks to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported atomically precise gold&#8208;silver core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, Au12Ag32/TiO2, are fabricated through strong cluster&#8211;support interactions. The controlled modulation of the electronic structure of the nanoclusters through the incorporation of the metallic gold core plays a critical role in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers, making Au12Ag32/TiO2 a &#8776;38&#8208;fold more efficient photocatalyst than TiO2 for hydrogen production (6.8 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from solar water splitting.








Abstract
While core&#8211;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here, the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8722;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8211;Ag core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell, is presented. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analog Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), which is &#8776;6.2 and &#8776;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

A concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 composite with heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to directly record serum metabolic fingerprints by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, distinguishing malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with a value of the area under the curve of 0.987. Their approach accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis.








Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways. A high&#8208;performance screening tool for EOC is in high demand to improve prognostic outcome but is still missing. Here, a concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 (MO/CMO) composite with a heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to record metabolic patterns of ovarian tumors by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). The MO/CMO composites with multiple physical effects induce enhanced light absorption, preferred charge transfer, increased photothermal conversion, and selective trapping of small molecules. The MO/CMO shows &#8776;2&#8211;5&#8208;fold signal enhancement compared to mono&#8208; or dual&#8208;enhancement counterparts, and &#8776;10&#8211;48&#8208;fold compared to the commercialized products. Subsequently, serum metabolic fingerprints of ovarian tumors are revealed by MO/CMO&#8208;assisted LDI&#8208;MS, achieving high reproducibility of direct serum detection without treatment. Furthermore, machine learning of the metabolic fingerprints distinguishes malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with the area under the curve value of 0.987. Finally, seven metabolites associated with the progression of ovarian tumors are screened as potential biomarkers. The approach guides the future depiction of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrix for intensive MS detection and accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis scenarios.

         <title>Reversible Perspiring Artificial &#8220;Fingertips&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.








Abstract
Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function fabric with both radiative cooling and solar heating functions on two sides of the fabric is developed. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance for zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. As a roof coating, the dual&#8208;function fabric can achieve &#8776;22.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 energy saving, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 billion kg global CO2 emission reduction.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers is developed, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges) and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrates &#8776;15.5 and &#8776;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibits high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to Ex Vivo and In Vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.








Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications.

&lt;p&gt;Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;p&gt;2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light-harvesting and -emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few-layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate-tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Modular Design of a Polymer&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Based Mechanically Compliant Worm&#8208;Like Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically compliant earthworm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular soft body that primarily consists of polymers is presented. The robot is based on electrothermally actuated polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based segments and is capable of directional locomotion on various surfaces, turning on the spot, steering during forward movement, and, most strikingly, squeezing itself through constrictions that are smaller than its cross&#8208;section in the resting state.








Abstract
Soft earthworm&#8208;like robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals that&#160;they mimic, most of the worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here, a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers is reported. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments are designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation is used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled silicon&#8208; and Mott&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors ares developed, which exhibit a large superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18), an ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA, high photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and great detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones). Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor vision processing.








Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;f&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

         <title>Principles for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS2 for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.








Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods.

Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

&lt;p&gt;Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth-front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high-quality 2D-materials-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D-materials-assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D-material-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single-crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single-crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These results provide a suitable growth-front construction strategy for high-quality 2D-material-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy.

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;based approach to decorating DNA&#8208;based scaffolds in a dynamic and reversible way is demonstrated. Enzyme&#8208;responsive strands in the assembled scaffolds undergo degradation and spontaneous replacement by strands decorated with different labels in the presence of their corresponding enzymes.








Abstract
An approach to achieving dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds is demonstrated here. To do this, rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels are employed. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H, or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of the strategy, the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk is demonstrated. By doing so, DNA scaffolds that display different antibody recognition patterns are obtained. The approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing of their body shape is significant for soft robots planning trajectories and actions, which can also be a feedback to interactions with the environment. We&#160;present a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin, confluence with machine learning technique, endows soft robots with proprioception of their own status and exteroception of environment awareness, exhibiting advanced artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

         <title>Heteroepitaxy of 2D CuCr2Te4 with Robust Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a heteroepitaxial growth strategy of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and Cr2Te3, with thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K via interfacial charge transfer in lattice&#8208;matched CuCr2Te4/Cr2Te3 heterostructure. The thickness&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetic heterostructures are promising for constructing functional spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in 2D have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets is reported on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 to 260&#160;K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness are observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain are discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. The work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T Cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and In Situ Antitumor Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organelle communication interception nanosystem is constructed with an amorphous Fe0 core and an ultrathin crystalline Fe3O4 shell (ACFeNPs). &#183;OH can efficiently generate along with the spatiotemporal trajectory of ACFeNPs within tumor cells. ACFeNPs transfer from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and block the crosstalk between them, sequentially trigger&#160;AMPK/mTOR, lysosomal damage, and the IRE1/JNK signaling pathway, ultimately inducing deep apoptosis of tumor cells that cannot be alleviated. All experiments confirm the enhanced tumor inhibition of the organelle communication spatiotemporal interception strategy and reveal the biomolecular mechanism.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, a communication interception strategy is reported, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) are fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially enter lysosomes and trigger autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocks the generation of functional autolysosomes, which mediates ER&#8211;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy is paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induce ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, the ER&#8208;stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway is fully activated, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;Nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exosome&#160;bio&#8208;nanoparticles from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) inhibit senescent phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells and rescue their tenogenic differentiation capacity by inhibiting histone methylation and nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B. Local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres exhibits excellent anti&#8208;aging effects, including reducing senescent cells and heterotopic&#160;ossification, and thereby restores endogenous tendon regeneration capacity in aged rats.








Abstract
Aging impairs tendon stem/progenitor&#160;cell function and tendon homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interest in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, it is shown that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Tough Hydrogel Electrolytes for Anti&#8208;Freezing Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; are synergistically utilized to create a flexible electrolyte with superior strength, freezing tolerance, high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential over semi&#8208;closed&#8208;pore&#160;counterparts), and stable cycling, benefitting from the suppressed dendritic growth and side reactions (30&#8201;000 cycles), which pushes the limit of flexible batteries toward higher stability in harsh environments.








Abstract
As the soaring demand for energy storage continues to grow, batteries that can cope with extreme conditions are highly desired. Yet, existing battery materials are limited by weak mechanical properties and freeze&#8208;vulnerability, prohibiting safe energy storage in devices that are exposed to low temperature and unusual mechanical impacts. Herein, a fabrication method harnessing the synergistic effect of co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; that can produce poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel electrolytes with unique open&#8208;cell porous structures, composed of strongly aggregated polymer chains, and containing disrupted hydrogen bonds among free water molecules, is introduced. The hydrogel electrolyte simultaneously combines high strength (tensile strength 15.6&#160;MPa), freeze&#8208;tolerance (&lt;&#160;&#8722;77 &#176;C), high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential), and dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression for stable performance (30&#8201;000 cycles). The high generality of this method is further demonstrated with poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) hydrogels. This work takes a further step toward flexible battery development for harsh environments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond 2D Perovskite Scintillators by Dielectric Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr6]2&#8722; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub&#8208;nanosecond region. The sub&#8208;nanosecond BM2PbBr4 scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental realization and application of a tetramode material are presented. According to Cauchy elasticity, four out of the six deformation modes of such materials are considered &#8220;easy&#8221;. A property that can be exploited as a compact broadband polarizer for transverse phonons. This is demonstrated experimentally with a 3D metamaterial structure fabricated using direct laser writing.








Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, 3D materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#160;= 6), pentamode (N&#160;= 5), tetramode (N&#160;= 4), trimode (N&#160;= 3), dimode (N&#160;= 2), and monomode (N&#160;= 1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured 3D polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#160;have constructed convertible RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 perovskite with one organic amine through a protonation control strategy. Organic cations in (4AEPy)PbI4 participate in band edge construction, making its exciton binding energy as low as 27.3 meV and producing more free carriers.








Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriches the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine is reported, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV&#160;to&#160;generate&#160;free&#160;charges. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. Thus&#160;the (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyair s&#8208;1.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile fabrication of ultrathin NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large area (&gt;200 cm2) with remarkable homogeneity and texture along [00l] direction is presented. This stems from the superior solution processability of the NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets synthesized via a scalable approach. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes exhibit outstanding rejections toward various metal ion and dye solutions while at modest permeance compared with other reported membranes.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. Herein, this work reports the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt;200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt;98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8211;3.2 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism is reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new A&#8208;site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A3Bi2I9&#8208;type HPs by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG3Bi2I9 SC shows a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X&#8208;ray detection, high spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

The prepared large AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility-lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Therefore, the X-ray detectors fabricated on the AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1,&lt;/sup&gt; and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state-of-the-art MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) X-ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low-cost and high-performance lead-free X-ray detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiexciton Generation from a 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiexciton generation (MEG) is found in a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, phenylammonium cadmium chloride (PACC). The MEG effect induced by Mn2+ doping improves the red phosphorescent quantum yield of PACC from 6% to nearly 200%, thus resulting in a switching from blue to red afterglow.








Abstract
2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the field of optoelectronics due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between the inorganic metal ions lead to a low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP phenylammonium cadmium chloride&#160;(PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P&#160;&lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow is reported. Interestingly, the Mn&#8208;doped PACC exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% quantum yield and 15&#160;ms lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multiexciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the superefficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultrahigh energy utilization.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled operation of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating applications is demonstrated via the realization of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor, free of the spurious effects caused by electrochemical reactions. The devices exhibit high geometrical capacitances 20&#8202;&#8211;&#8202;50&#8287;&#181;F&#8287;cm&#8722;2\[20--50\:\mu {\rm{F}}\:{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) enabling the accumulation of electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, to gate&#8208;induced superconductivity, and to perform ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy.








Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here, a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs) is explored, the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior are identified, and properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20&#8202;&#8722;&#8202;50&#8201;&#181;F cm&#8722;2\[20{\bm{ - }}50\;\mu F c{m^{{\bm{ - }}2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) are demonstrated. Using 2D semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2 are demostrated, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;Crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparation of ultrathin monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) single crystals (EOT&#8776;0.29 nm, EOT is equivalent oxide thickness) via thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. By using K3[Fe(CN)6] as seeding, the large&#8208;scale parent ZrS2 is easily grown. The grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. Using m&#8208;ZrO2 as top gate dielectric, the MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gaps are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) shows good potential because of its inertness and high&#8208;&#954; with respect to SiO2, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, the controllable preparation of ultrathin m&#8208;ZrO2 single crystals via the in situ thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. As&#8208;grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8776;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19, and a breakdown voltage (EBD) of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) by using m&#8208;ZrO2 as a dielectric layer shows comparable mobility to that using SiO2 dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m&#8208;ZrO2/MoS2 and high crystalline quality of m&#8208;ZrO2 lead to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) logic FET.

The great potential of the application of room&#8208;temperature in the situ cold bonding technique for the rational design and optimization of LLZ/Li interfaces with low cost, high safety and operability is highlighted. The prepared RT&#8208;MCL shows good interfacial compatibility and excellent electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte&#160;is a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) is introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also inhibits growth of Li dendrites and promotes uniform Li deposition. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and provides stable cycling performance over 2000 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, this in situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce cost and eliminate potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights tremendous potential of this cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Changeable Dynamic Conformal Electrode/electrolyte Interlayer enabling Pressure&#8208;Independent Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase&#8208;changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P&#8208;P&#8208;I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling&#8208;out resistance), and reversible phase&#8208;change property, disengaging Li&#8208;SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (=1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8211;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.








Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B&#8208;cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL&#8208;6) and miRNA&#8208;126&#8208;5p(miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. These findings provide more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering.

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Toward Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a high&#8208;efficiency ternary matrix platform for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo&#8208;physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling&#8208;out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;In a high-efficiency ternary matrix platform for all-polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo-physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling-out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators for zinc&#8208;based energy storage are reported. The separators are composed of a high&#8208;strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites&#8208;rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion&#8208;sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.








Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass&#8208;fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single Atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. Herein, the urea synthesis catalyzed by Cu1&#8211;CeO2 is reported. The dynamic reversible reconstitution of the catalyst configuration is monitored using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and the Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Transform of clusters back to single&#8208;atom configurations occurs when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate has emerged to meet the comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of urea catalyzed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted as Cu1&#8211;CeO2) is reported. The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favorable C&#63743;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;enzyme&#8208;near&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;responsive immune&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy and photothermal&#8208;assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL have a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activates surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose serves as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top&#8208;down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.








Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation methylamine is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top-down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic compound (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx, ZOF) with an aliovalent F&#8208;doped wurtzite motif shows selective Zn2+ conductivity to regulate zinc migration and deposition. ZOF@Zn anode exhibits a low overpotential of 13.3&#160;mV at 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in symmetric cells, and high stability of 169.7&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 in MnO2//Zn full batteries for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides, and halides are individually applied as a Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds are not studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. A heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx) coating layer is designed by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within the wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1&#8722;xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1&#8722;xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits a low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles. This work may enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy toward BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) with ultra&#8208;thin structure by chelating interaction of Bi3+ ions and acetate ions, and ion exchange between Cl&#8722; ions and acetate ions. The prepared BiOCl MSCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity stability and general adaptability for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.








Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8208; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release, and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS2 nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheet (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the WS2 are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS. FX11&#8208;loaded&#160;TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2)&#160;selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibits the&#160;production of adenosine triphosphate . Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibits outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrates that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Its&#160;tumor accumulation is visualized using in vivo computed tomography . Notably, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 with US irradiation remarkably suppresses the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of piezodynamic therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting 2D WS2 is a novel strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors.

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary &#8220;ligaments&#8221; are developed to endow fragile perovskite grain boundaries with toughness, water resistance, and room temperature self&#8208;healing properties. Meanwhile, they can also passivate the defects and release the residual tensile strain in perovskite films. The resultant flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a record 23.84% power conversion efficiency and robust mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, a cross&#8208;linkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium is carefully developed. The cross&#8208;linking acts as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibit promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) are obtained for 0.062&#160;and 1.004&#160;cm2&#160;devices; the flexible devices also show overall improved stabilities with T90&#160;&gt;20&#160;000&#160;bending cycles, operational stability with T90&#160;&gt;1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity&#160;=&#160;30%) with T90&#160;&gt;3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;Activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane expressed &#945;PD&#8208;L1 with MMP2 responsive shielding domain is engineered to coat on BTO NPs, the resulting M@BTO NPs generate ROS and O2 to induce immunogenic cell death under ultrasound induced piezocatalysis, effectively switching &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;immune&#8208;hot&#8221; tumors while achieving specific immune checkpoint blockade, providing a robust stimuli&#8208;responsive bioengineering system for augmenting tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades is engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies are cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound (US)&#160;irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combines MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface in situ polymerization technology, solid polymeric ether&#8208;based electrolytes containing sulfonimide&#8208;based salts are designed as a high&#8208;performance cathode coating, enabling the durable compatibility with both Ni&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathodes and metallic anodes, accompanying with anticorrosion of aluminum current collectors. This novel interface with high&#8208;voltage tolerance and adjustable components provides a new strategy toward long&#8208;term cyclability of high&#8208;voltage metal batteries.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anticorrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (4.3 V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes toward high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>A Nonswelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonswelling hydrogels with regenerable high wet tissue adhesion are fabricated. Subsequently, neural microelectrode arrays and rapid&#8208;response strain sensors are integrated into the hydrogel to fabricate bifunctional tissue&#8208;interface bioelectronics. Additionally, these bioelectronics possess excellent electrical properties. Electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyography (EMG), and tissue movement information are accurately recorded by the bioelectronics, and tissue fatigue is successfully monitored.








Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bonds break in the currently reported hydrogels, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. In this work, a nonswelling hydrogel (named as &#8220;PAACP&#8221;) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion is synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking poly(vinyl butyral) with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa, which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel can be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel shows great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue is successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular and random double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent Y&#8208;series acceptors are designed and synthesized, in which the random copolymer provides a high efficiency of 13.02% compared to the regular polymer with an efficiency of 2.75% in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides, and nonfused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the ambipolar charge transport&#160;and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

Soft Robotics
Wormlike robots can navigate through uneven terrain and constricted spaces, but it has proved difficult to completely avoid rigid components, limiting the compliance of such machines. In article 2210409, Hillel J. Chiel, Roger D. Quinn, Christoph Weder, Kathryn A. Daltorio, and co&#8208;workers report an earthworm&#8208;inspired robot that is based on soft polymer actuators. The robot moves through peristaltic locomotion and can wiggle itself through small openings.

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
In article number 2207765, Megalamane Siddaramappa Bootharaju, Jong Suk Yoo, Nanfeng Zheng, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers show how gold doping selectively at the core of a 44&#8208;atom silver nanocluster can modulate the electronic structure and enhance the stability of the resulting gold&#8211;silver core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;nanostructure through synergistic effects. Increased interfacial charge transfer due to a favorably modified band alignment makes the core&#8211;shell nanocluster a promising cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from solar water splitting.

Artificial Fingertips
Human fingertips with intricate structures and delicate perspiration system help people in gripping, climbing, or even more complex activities. In article number 2209729, Dirk J. Broer, Danqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of a coating made of cholesteric liquid crystal networks to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible, as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the surface tribological property. The performance of this material shows its potential to be applied for robotic devices.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for 2D Electronics: Challenges, Advances, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high&#8208;performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high&#8208;performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high-performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high-&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next-generation nanoelectronics.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond-silicon field-effect-transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high-performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state-of-the-art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>

A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.

Improvements in self&#8208;assembly technology have fueled the applications of BODIPY&#160;in diagnosis and treatment. This review summarizes the molecular structure design and self&#8208;assembly strategy of BODIPY, and its applications as a multifunctional theranostic agent in biomedical fields.








Abstract
The use of boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#160;in&#160;biomedicine&#160;is&#160;reviewed.&#160;To open, its synthesis and regulatory strategies are summarized, and inspiring cutting&#8208;edge work in post&#8208;functionalization strategies is highlighted. A brief overview of assembly model of BODIPY is then provided: BODIPY is introduced as a promising building block for the formation of single&#8208; and multicomponent self&#8208;assembled systems, including nanostructures suitable for aqueous environments, thereby showing the great development potential of supramolecular assembly in biomedicine applications. The frontier progress of BODIPY in biomedical application is thereafter described, supported by examples of the frontiers of biomedical applications of BODIPY&#8208;containing smart materials: it mainly involves the application of materials based on BODIPY building blocks and their assemblies in fluorescence bioimaging, photoacoustic imaging, disease treatment including photodynamic therapy, photothermal therapy, and immunotherapy. Lastly, not only the current status of the BODIPY family in the biomedical field but also the challenges worth considering are summarized. At the same time, insights into the future development prospects of biomedically applicable BODIPY are provided.
