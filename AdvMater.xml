      <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides: Design, Modulation, and Challenges in Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are considered to be promising candidates over noble metal catalysts for their electrochemical hydrogen production. The basic mechanism for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is introduced, followed by a description of the different synthesis methods and modulation approaches to enhance the catalytic performance of TMD&#8208;based catalysts toward HER.








Abstract
Hydrogen has been deemed as an ideal substitute fuel to fossil energy because of its renewability and the highest energy density among all chemical fuels. One of the most economical, ecofriendly, and high&#8208;performance ways of hydrogen production is electrochemical water splitting. Recently, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (also known as 2D TMDs) showed their utilization potentiality as cost&#8208;effective hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) catalysts in water electrolysis. Herein, recent representative research efforts and systematic progress made in 2D TMDs are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are discussed. Furthermore, general methods of synthesizing 2D TMDs materials are introduced in detail and the advantages and disadvantages for some specific methods are provided. This explanation includes several important regulation strategies of creating more active sites, heteroatoms doping, phase engineering, construction of heterostructures, and synergistic modulation which are capable of optimizing the electrical conductivity, exposure to the catalytic active sites, and reaction energy barrier of the electrode material to boost the HER kinetics. In the last section, the current obstacles and future chances for the development of 2D TMDs electrocatalysts are proposed to provide insight into and valuable guidelines for fabricating effective HER electrocatalysts.

Recent progress of MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging technologies are summarized.

Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled micro&#8208; and nanomotors (MNMs) have shown great potential for applications in the biomedical field, such as active targeted delivery, detoxification, minimally invasive diagnostics, and nanosurgery, owing to their tiny size, autonomous motion, and navigation capacities. To enter the clinic, biomedical MNMs request the biodegradability of their manufacturing materials, the biocompatibility of chemical fuels or externally physical fields, the capability of overcoming various biological barriers (e.g., biofouling, blood flow, blood&#8211;brain barrier, cell membrane), and the in vivo visual positioning for autonomous navigation. Herein, the recent advances of synthetic MNMs in overcoming biological barriers and in vivo motion&#8208;tracking imaging techniques are highlighted. The challenges and future research priorities are also addressed. With continued attention and innovation, it is believed that, in the future, biomedical MNMs will pave the way to improve the targeted drug delivery efficiency.

      <title>Guiding Cell Network Assembly using Shape&#8208;Morphing Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Choreographed movement of cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) is a common, yet under&#8208;engineered tissue&#8208;building process. Shape&#8208;changing metamaterials (&#8220;kinomorphs&#8221;) made from precisely patterned cells in ECM are introduced. These cells program strains and trigger shape&#8208;morphing dynamics, leading to multi&#8208;scale kidney cell network assembly and maturation as tubules. The kinomorphs advance emerging tissue model systems by directing cell assembly over centimeters.








Abstract
Forces and relative movement between cells and extracellular matrix (ECM) are crucial to the self&#8208;organization of tissues during development. However, the spatial range over which these dynamics can be controlled in engineering approaches is limited, impeding progress toward the construction of large, structurally mature tissues. Herein, shape&#8208;morphing materials called &#8220;kinomorphs&#8221; that rationally control the shape and size of multicellular networks are described. Kinomorphs are sheets of ECM that change their shape, size, and density depending on patterns of cell contractility within them. It is shown that these changes can manipulate structure&#8208;forming behaviors of epithelial cells in many spatial locations at once. Kinomorphs are built using a new photolithographic technology to pattern single cells into ECM sheets that are &gt;10&#215; larger than previously described. These patterns are designed to partially mimic the branch geometry of the embryonic kidney epithelial network. Origami&#8208;inspired simulations are then used to predict changes in kinomorph shapes. Last, kinomorph dynamics are shown to provide a centimeter&#8208;scale program that sets specific spatial locations in which &#8776;50 &#181;m&#8208;diameter epithelial tubules form by cell coalescence and structural maturation. The kinomorphs may significantly advance organ&#8208;scale tissue construction by extending the spatial range of cell self&#8208;organization in emerging model systems such as organoids.

Critical roadmaps on future developments of this cutting&#8208;edge research field are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;based solar cells have attracted great attention due to their low cost and high photovoltaic (PV) performance. In addition to their success in the PV sector, there has been growing interest in employing perovskites in energy&#8208;efficient smart windows and other building technologies owing to their large absorption coefficient and color tunability. The major challenge lies in integrating perovskite materials into windows and building facades and combining them with added functionalities while maintaining their remarkable power conversion efficiencies. Herein, advances that have been made in the application of perovskites to building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs) in four areas are highlighted: semitransparent windows, colorful wall facades, electrochromic windows, and thermochromic windows. In addition, the opportunities and challenges of this cutting&#8208;edge research area and important roadmaps for the future use of perovskites in BIPVs are discussed.

      <title>In Situ TEM Study on Conversion&#8208;Type Electrodes for Rechargeable Ion Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
In situ transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool to study rechargeable battery materials, providing mechanistic insights into understanding phase transformation and associated structural and chemical evolution upon charge and discharge. The recent progress on reaction mechanism, kinetics, and degradation of conversion&#8208;type electrode materials, especially metal oxides and chalcogenides, is systematically reviewed; the challenges and prospects are also discussed.








Abstract
Conversion&#8208;type materials have been considered as potentially high&#8208;energy&#8208;density alternatives to commercially dominant intercalation&#8208;based electrodes for rechargeable ion batteries and have attracted tremendous research effort to meet the performance for viable energy&#8208;storage technologies. In situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) has been extensively employed to provide mechanistic insights into understanding the behavior of battery materials. Noticeably, a great portion of previous in situ TEM studies has been focused on conversion&#8208;type materials, but a dedicated review for this group of materials is missing in the literature. Herein, recent developments of in situ TEM techniques for investigation of dynamic phase transformation and associated structural, morphological, and chemical evolutions during conversion reactions with alkali ions in secondary batteries are comprehensively summarized. The materials of interest broadly cover metal oxides, chalcogenides, fluorides, phosphides, nitrides, and silicates with specific emphasis on spinel metal oxides and recently emerged 2D metal chalcogenides. Special focus is placed on the scientific findings that are uniquely obtained by in situ TEM to address fundamental questions and practical issues regarding phase transformation, structural evolution, electrochemical redox, reaction mechanism, kinetics, and degradation. Critical challenges and perspectives are discussed for advancing new knowledge that can bridge the gap between prototype materials and real&#8208;world applications.

      <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Functional Polymeric Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.








Abstract
In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.

&lt;p&gt;Wood components are considered as important feedstocks to fabricate functional materials. An insightful summary of recent wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials is provided from the perspective of macromolecular engineering, including the structural characteristics of cellulose and lignin, molecular modification, and subsequent assembly behavior to generate distinctive functional materials.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, tremendous efforts have been dedicated to developing wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials due to their distinctive properties, including environmental friendliness, renewability, and biodegradability. Thus, the uniqueness of the main components in wood (cellulose and lignin) has attracted enormous interest for both fundamental research and practical applications. Herein, the emerging field of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by means of macromolecular engineering is reviewed, covering the basic structures and properties of the main components, the design principle to utilize these main components, and the resulting wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials in terms of elastomers, hydrogels, aerogels, and nanoparticles. In detail, the natural features of wood components and their significant roles in the fabrication of materials are emphasized. Furthermore, the utilization of controlled/living polymerization, click chemistry, dynamic bonds chemistry, etc., for the modification is specifically discussed from the perspective of molecular design, together with their sequential assembly into different morphologies. The functionalities of wood&#8208;derived polymeric materials are mainly focused on self&#8208;healing and shape&#8208;memory abilities, adsorption, conduction, etc. Finally, the main challenges of wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials fabricated by macromolecular engineering are presented, as well as the potential solutions or directions to develop green and scalable wood&#8208;derived functional polymeric materials.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Bioactive&#8208;Tissue&#8208;Derived Nanocomposite Hydrogel for Permanent Arterial Embolization and Enhanced Vascular Healing</title>
      <dc:description>
A biohybrid hydrogel composed of cardiac&#8208;derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and nanoclay (NC) is developed as a multifunctional embolic biomaterial that offers both the biological activity and the mechanical support necessary for successful arterial embolization. The shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8211;NC hydrogel exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, retrievability, and proangiogenic characteristics to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed bioactive embolic agent for the treatment of a variety of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Transcatheter embolization is a minimally invasive procedure that uses embolic agents to intentionally block diseased or injured blood vessels for therapeutic purposes. Embolic agents in clinical practice are limited by recanalization, risk of non&#8208;target embolization, failure in coagulopathic patients, high cost, and toxicity. Here, a decellularized cardiac extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based nanocomposite hydrogel is developed to provide superior mechanical stability, catheter injectability, retrievability, antibacterial properties, and biological activity to prevent recanalization. The embolic efficacy of the shear&#8208;thinning ECM&#8208;based hydrogel is shown in a porcine survival model of embolization in the iliac artery and the renal artery. The ECM&#8208;based hydrogel promotes arterial vessel wall remodeling and a fibroinflammatory response while undergoing significant biodegradation such that only 25% of the embolic material remains at 14 days. With its unprecedented proregenerative, antibacterial properties coupled with favorable mechanical properties, and its superior performance in anticoagulated blood, the ECM&#8208;based hydrogel has the potential to be a next&#8208;generation biofunctional embolic agent that can successfully treat a wide range of vascular diseases.

      <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanostructured Lead Halide Perovskites: From Materials to Integrations and Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Recent years have witnessed substantial progress in nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based devices. Patterning and integration techniques for nanostructured perovskites are summarized and recent progress in novel nanostructured&#8208;perovskite&#8208;based applications is presented.








Abstract
In the past decade, lead halide perovskites have been intensively explored due to their promising future in photovoltaics. Owing to their remarkable material properties such as solution processability, nice defect tolerance, broad bandgap tunability, high quantum yields, large refractive index, and strong nonlinear effects, this family of materials has also shown advantages in many other optoelectronic devices including microlasers, photodetectors, waveguides, and metasurfaces. Very recently, the stability of perovskite devices has been improved with the optimization of synthesis methods and device architectures. It is widely accepted that it is the time to integrate all the perovskite devices into a real system. However, for integrated photonic circuits, the shapes and distributions of chemically synthesized perovskites are quite random and not suitable for integration. Consequently, controlled synthesis and the top&#8208;down fabrication process are highly desirable to break the barriers. Herein, the developments of patterning and integration techniques for halide perovskites, as well as the structure/function relationships, are systematically reviewed. The recent progress in the study of optical responses originating from nanostructured perovskites is also presented. Lastly, the challenges and perspective for nanostructured&#8208;perovskite devices are discussed.

      <title>A Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;Electrolyte&#8208;Based Molten Lithium&#8722;Molybdenum&#8722;Iron(II) Chloride Battery with Advanced Reaction Mechanism</title>
      <dc:description>
A garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery is reported.

This approach is promising for other alkali&#8208;metal&#8722;metal&#8208;chloride battery systems.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten&#8208;metal batteries have attracted considerable attention for grid&#8208;scale energy storage. Although ZEBRA batteries are considered one of the promising candidates, they still have the potential concern of metal particle growth and ion exchange with the &#946;&#8221;&#8208;Al2O3 electrolyte. Herein, a Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based molten lithium&#8722;molybdenum&#8722;iron(II) chloride battery (denoted as Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2) operated at temperature of 250 &#176;C, comprising a mixture of Fe and LiCl cathode materials, a Li anode, a garnet&#8208;type Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, and Mo additive, is designed to overcome these obstacles. Different from conventional battery reaction mechanisms, this battery revolutionarily synchronizes the reversible Fe&#8722;Mo alloying&#8722;dealloying reactions with the delithiation&#8722;lithiation processes, meaning that the porous Mo framework derived from Fe&#8722;Mo alloy simultaneously suppresses the growth of pure Fe particles. By adopting a Li anode and a Li&#8208;ion ceramic electrolyte, the corrosion problem between the cathode and the solid electrolyte is overcome. With similar battery cost ($12 kWh&#8722;1), the theoretical energy density of Li&#8722;Mo&#8722;FeCl2 battery surpasses that of a Na&#8722;FeCl2 ZEBRA battery over 25%, to 576 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 2216 Wh L&#8722;1, respectively. Experimental results further prove this cell has excellent cycling performance (472 mAh gLiCl&#8722;1 after 300 cycles, 50 mg active material) and strong tolerance against the overcharge&#8722;overdischarge (3&#8722;1.6 V) and freezing&#8722;thawing (25&#8722;250 &#176;C) incidents.

      <title>Chiral Assemblies of Laser&#8208;Printed Micropillars Directed by Asymmetrical Capillary Force</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The vortical dichroism of the assembled chiral architectures is investigated to show the potential in chiral photonics.








Abstract
Artificial microstructures composed of chiral building blocks are of great significance in the fields of optics and mechanics. Here, it is shown that highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The interfacial dynamics of the assembly process are studied to show that the sequential self&#8208;organization of the micropillars is influenced by the geometries, stiffness, and spatial arrangements. A diversity of chiral assemblies with controlled handedness is yielded by varying the pillar number, height, cross&#8208;section, laser power, and spatial topology. Lastly, the differential reflectance of light carrying opposite orbital angular momentums on the assembled chiral architectures are investigated, showcasing their potential in the field of chiral photonics concerning enantioselective response and exceptional optical functions.

&lt;p&gt;Highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The vortical dichroism of the assembled chiral architectures is investigated to show the potential in chiral photonics.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Artificial microstructures composed of chiral building blocks are of great significance in the fields of optics and mechanics. Here, it is shown that highly ordered chiral structures can be spontaneously assembled by a meniscus&#8208;directed capillary force arising in an evaporating liquid. The chirality is facilitated by rationally breaking the intrinsic symmetry in the unit cells through cooperative control of the geometry and spatial topology of the micropillars. The interfacial dynamics of the assembly process are studied to show that the sequential self&#8208;organization of the micropillars is influenced by the geometries, stiffness, and spatial arrangements. A diversity of chiral assemblies with controlled handedness is yielded by varying the pillar number, height, cross&#8208;section, laser power, and spatial topology. Lastly, the differential reflectance of light carrying opposite orbital angular momentums on the assembled chiral architectures are investigated, showcasing their potential in the field of chiral photonics concerning enantioselective response and exceptional optical functions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Quantum Confinement of Dirac Quasiparticles in Graphene Patterned with Sub&#8208;Nanometer Precision</title>
      <dc:description>
Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used to manipulate ensembles of hydrogen atoms that define insulating channels on graphene in a fast, reversible, robust, and versatile way. This enables the creation, with sub&#8208;nanometer precision, of 0D and 1D graphene nanostructures of arbitrary shapes and dimensions, which perfectly confine graphene Dirac quasiparticles.








Abstract
Quantum confinement of graphene Dirac&#8208;like electrons in artificially crafted nanometer structures is a long sought goal that would provide a strategy to selectively tune the electronic properties of graphene, including bandgap opening or quantization of energy levels. However, creating confining structures with nanometer precision in shape, size, and location remains an experimental challenge, both for top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. Moreover, Klein tunneling, offering an escape route to graphene electrons, limits the efficiency of electrostatic confinement. Here, a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) is used to create graphene nanopatterns, with sub&#8208;nanometer precision, by the collective manipulation of a large number of H atoms. Individual graphene nanostructures are built at selected locations, with predetermined orientations and shapes, and with dimensions going all the way from 2 nm up to 1 &#181;m. The method permits the patterns to be erased and rebuilt at will, and it can be implemented on different graphene substrates. STM experiments demonstrate that such graphene nanostructures confine very efficiently graphene Dirac quasiparticles, both in 0D and 1D structures. In graphene quantum dots, perfectly defined energy bandgaps up to 0.8 eV are found that scale as the inverse of the dot&#8217;s linear dimension, as expected for massless Dirac fermions.

      <title>Designing a Transparent CdIn2S4/In2S3 Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Photoanode Integrated with a Perovskite Solar Cell for Unbiased Water Splitting</title>
      <dc:description>
CdIn2S4/In2S3 bulk heterojunction nanosheet arrays are designed as photoanodes of photoelectrochemical cells, which have high transparency and high separation efficiency up to 90%. This photoanode is integrated with a perovskite solar cell to form an unbiased solar water&#8208;splitting system, delivering a solar to hydrogen conversion efficiency of 3.3%.








Abstract
The integration of photoelectrochemical photoanodes and solar cells to build an unbiased solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion system provides a promising way to solve the energy crisis. The key point is to develop highly transparent photoanodes, while its bulk separation efficiency (&#951;sep.) and surface injection efficiency are as high as possible. To resolve this contradiction, first a novel CdIn2S4/In2S3 bulk heterojunctions in the interior of nanosheets is designed as a photoanode with high transparency and an ultrahigh &#951;sep. up to 90%. Furthermore, decorating the ultrathin amorphous SnO2 layer by atomic layer deposition, the surface oxygen&#8208;evolution kinetics of the photoanode are increased significantly. As a result, the onset potential of the photoanode shifts negatively to 0.02 V vs RHE, and the photocurrent density boosts to 2.98 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V vs RHE, which is ten times higher than that of pristine CdIn2S4. Such a high&#8208;performance photoanode enables the integrated metal sulfide photoanode&#8211;perovskite solar cell system to deliver a STH conversion efficiency of 3.3%.

      <title>Dual Single&#8208;Atomic Ni&#8208;N4 and Fe&#8208;N4 Sites Constructing Janus Hollow Graphene for Selective Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
Separate&#8208;sided Ni&#8208;N4 and Fe&#8208;N4 single&#8208;atomic functionalization of hollow graphene spheres (Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4) is realized.

The Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 air&#8208;cathode delivers excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability in rechargeable Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated metal single atoms in carbon have aroused extensive interest recently and have been growing as an active research frontier in a wide range of key renewable energy reactions and devices. Herein, a step&#8208;by&#8208;step self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to allocate nickel (Ni) and iron (Fe) single atoms respectively on the inner and outer walls of graphene hollow nanospheres (GHSs), realizing separate&#8208;sided different single&#8208;atom functionalization of hollow graphene. The Ni or Fe single atom is demonstrated to be coordinated with four N atoms via the formation of a Ni&#8208;N4 or Fe&#8208;N4 planar configuration. The developed Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 Janus material exhibits excellent bifunctional electrocatalytic performance, in which the outer Fe&#8208;N4 clusters dominantly contribute to high activity toward the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), while the inner Ni&#8208;N4 clusters are responsible for excellent activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Density functional theory calculations demonstrate the structures and reactivities of Fe&#8208;N4 and Ni&#8208;N4 for the ORR and OER. The Ni&#8208;N4/GHSs/Fe&#8208;N4 endows a rechargeable Zn&#8211;air battery with excellent energy efficiency and cycling stability as an air&#8208;cathode, outperforming that of the benchmark Pt/C+RuO2 air&#8208;cathode. The current work paves a new avenue for precise control of single&#8208;atom sites on carbon surface for the high&#8208;performance and selective electrocatalysts.

      <title>Conversion of Intercalated MoO3 to Multi&#8208;Heteroatoms&#8208;Doped MoS2 with High Hydrogen Evolution Activity</title>
      <dc:description>
An intercalation&#8208;assisted method is developed to obtain multi&#8208;metal&#8208;doped H&#8208;MoS2, which is proven to be a universal method. The doping of adjacent cobalt and palladium monomers on MoS2 greatly enhances the HER catalytic activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;1 and Tafel slope of Co&#8208;Pd&#8208;MoS2 is 49.3 mV and 43.2 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Lack of effective strategies to regulate the internal activity of MoS2 limits its practical application for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs). Doping of heteroatoms without forming aggregation or an edge enrichment is still challenging, and its effect on the HER needs to be further explored. Herein, a two&#8208;step method is developed to obtain multi&#8208;metal&#8208;doped H&#8208;MoS2, which includes intercalation of the layered MoO3 precursor with a following sulfurization. Benefiting from the capability of the intercalation method to uniformly and simultaneously introduce different elements into the van der Waals gap, this method is universal to obtain multi&#8208;heteroatoms co&#8208;doped MoS2 without forming clusters, phase separation, and an edge enrichment. It is demonstrated that the doping of adjacent cobalt and palladium monomers on MoS2 greatly enhances the HER catalytic activity. The overpotential at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and Tafel slope of Co and Pd co&#8208;doped MoS2 is found to be 49.3 mV and 43.2 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively, representing a superior acidic HER catalytic activity. This intercalation&#8208;assisted method also provides a new and general strategy to synthesize uniformly doped transition metal dichalcogenides for various applications.

      <title>Naphthodithiophenediimide&#8211;Bithiopheneimide Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Organic Thermoelectrics: Significant Impact of Backbone Orientation on Conductivity and Thermoelectric Performance</title>
      <dc:description>
New n&#8208;dopable copolymers consisting of naphthodithiophenediimide and bithiopheneimide units are synthesized by direct arylation polymerization. The backbone orientation is found to significantly impact the electrical conductivity and the power factor (PF). Thus, a polymer characterized by the bimodal orientation with both face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on fractions shows PF of up to 53.4 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at room temperature, which is among the highest for n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers.








Abstract
The development of n&#8208;type conjugated polymers with high electrical conductivity (&#963;) has continued to pose a massive challenge in organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). New structural insights into the charge&#8208;carrier transport are necessitated for the realization of high&#8208;performance OTEs. In this study, three new n&#8208;type copolymers, named pNB, pNB&#8208;Tz, and pNB&#8208;TzDP, consisting of naphthodithiophenediimide (NDTI) and bithiopheneimide (BTI) units, are synthesized by direct arylation polymerization. The backbone orientation is altered by incorporating thiazole units into the backbone and tuning the branching point of the side chain. The alteration of the backbone orientation from face&#8208;on to bimodal orientation with both face&#8208;on and edge&#8208;on fractions significantly impacts the &#963; and the power factors (PFs) of the polymers. As a result, pNB&#8208;TzDP, with the bimodal orientation, demonstrates a high &#963; of up to 11.6 S cm&#8722;1 and PF of up to 53.4 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, which are among the highest in solution&#8208;processed n&#8208;doped conjugated polymers reported so far. Further studies reveal that the bimodal orientation of pNB&#8208;TzDP introduces 3D conduction channels and leads to better accommodation of dopants, which should be the key factors for the excellent thermoelectric performance.

      <title>High&#8208;Index&#8208;Facet Metal&#8208;Alloy Nanoparticles as Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts</title>
      <dc:description>
A method to introduce high&#8208;index facets into compositionally uniform colloidal Pt&#8211;M (M = Ni, Co, and Cu) and Rh&#8211;M (M = Ni and Co) nanoparticles is developed.

Abstract
A method to introduce high&#8208;index facets into colloidally synthesized nanoparticles is used to produce compositionally uniform Pt&#8211;M (M = Ni, Co, and Cu) and Rh&#8211;M (M = Ni and Co) tetrahexahedral nanoparticles. The realization of this method allows for a systematic study of catalyst activity as a function of particle composition for various electrooxidation reactions of liquid fuels (formic acid, methanol, and ethanol). The individual contributions of their high&#8208;index facets, internal alloying of transition metals, and surface Bi modification to their electrocatalytic properties are experimentally explored, resulting in three key findings. First, the presence of high&#8208;index facets is favorable for improving the catalytic activity for all three classes of reactions studied. Second, the effect of transition metal alloying on catalytic activity differs from reaction to reaction. For methanol electrooxidation in an acid electrolyte, due to the contribution from surface Bi modification being negligible, transition metal alloying can significantly the improve overall catalytic efficiency. However, for the other studied reactions, where the surface Bi is highly favorable for improving catalytic activity, there is little influence from transition metal alloying. Finally, multimetallic tetrahexahedral particles have improved stabilities during prolonged operation compared to their monometallic counterparts due to the presence of the alloyed transition metal atoms.

      <title>Constructing an Adaptive Heterojunction as a Highly Active Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
      <dc:description>
Electrochemical delithiation and surface reconstruction of LiNiO2 lead to the formation of an adaptive heterojunction between delithiated&#8208;LiNiO2 and the surface NiOOH layer. Such a process facilitates the formation of NiOO* species within the reconstructed NiOOH surface and the OER activity is boosted significantly.








Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting is of prime importance to green energy technology. Particularly, the reaction at the anode side, namely the oxygen evolution reaction (OER), requires a high overpotential associated with O&#63743;O bond formation, which dominates the energy&#8208;efficiency of the whole process. Activating the anionic redox chemistry of oxygen in metal oxides, which involves the formation of superoxo/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722;, commonly occurs in most highly active catalysts during the OER process. In this study, a highly active catalyst is designed: electrochemically delithiated LiNiO2, which facilitates the formation of superoxo/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722; species, i.e., NiOO*, for enhancing OER activity. The OER&#8208;induced surface reconstruction builds an adaptive heterojunction, where NiOOH grows on delithiated LiNiO2 (delithiated&#8208;LiNiO2/NiOOH). At this junction, the lithium vacancies within the delithiated LiNiO2 optimize the electronic structure of the surface NiOOH to form stable NiOO* species, which enables better OER activity. This finding provides new insight for designing highly active catalysts with stable superoxo&#8208;like/peroxo&#8208;like (O2)n&#8722; for water oxidation.

      <title>Multiply Charged Conjugated Polyelectrolytes as a Multifunctional Interlayer for Efficient and Scalable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are studied as interlayers in perovskite&#8208;based solar cells. By modulating the ionic density in CPEs, wetting, perovskite crystal growth, and interfacial defect passivation are optimized, achieving 18.38% efficiency for a large&#8208;area (1 cm2) device with negligible hysteresis and stable power output.








Abstract
A series of anionic conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) is synthesized based on poly(fluorene&#8208;co&#8208;phenylene) by varying the side&#8208;chain ionic density from two to six per repeat units (MPS2&#8208;TMA, MPS4&#8208;TMA, and MPS6&#8208;TMA). The effect of MPS2, 4, 6&#8208;TMA as interlayers on top of a hole&#8208;extraction layer of poly(bis(4&#8208;phenyl)&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenylamine (PTAA) is investigated in inverted perovskite solar cells (PeSCs). Owing to the improved wettability of perovskites on hydrophobic PTAA with the CPEs, the PeSCs with CPE interlayers demonstrate a significantly enhanced device performance, with negligible device&#8208;to&#8208;device dependence relative to the reference PeSC without CPEs. By increasing the ionic density in the MPS&#8208;TMA interlayers, the wetting, interfacial defect passivation, and crystal growth of the perovskites are significantly improved without increasing the series resistance of the PeSCs. In particular, the open&#8208;circuit voltage increases from 1.06 V for the PeSC with MPS2&#8208;TMA to 1.11 V for the PeSC with MPS6&#8208;TMA. The trap densities of the PeSCs with MPS2,4,6&#8208;TMA are further analyzed using frequency&#8208;dependent capacitance measurements. Finally, a large&#8208;area (1 cm2) PeSC is successfully fabricated with MPS6&#8208;TMA, showing a power conversion efficiency of 18.38% with negligible hysteresis and a stable power output under light soaking for 60 s.

      <title>Directed Assembly of Liquid Metal&#8211;Elastomer Conductors for Stretchable and Self&#8208;Healing Electronics</title>
      <dc:description>
Dielectrophoresis&#8208;assisted alignment of eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microdroplets in a silicone matrix enables the fabrication of stretchable and flexible electrically conducting microwires at significantly low weight loadings (10 wt%). Liquid EGaIn eliminates compliance mismatch with the elastomeric matrix. This directed assembly within a silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can heal severely damaged regions of stretchable interconnects to restore mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity.








Abstract
Growing interest in soft robotics, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins has created demand for soft, compliant, and stretchable electrodes and interconnects. Here, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is used to assemble, align, and sinter eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microdroplets in uncured poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) to form electrically conducting microwires. There are several noteworthy aspects of this approach. 1) Generally, EGaIn droplets in silicone at loadings approaching 90 wt% remain insulating and form a conductive network only when subjected to sintering. Here, DEP facilitates assembly of EGaIn droplets into conductive microwires at loadings as low as 10 wt%. 2) DEP is done in silicone for the first time, enabling the microwires to be cured in a stretchable matrix. 3) Liquid EGaIn droplets sinter during DEP to form a stretchable metallic microwire that retains its shape after curing the silicone. 4) Use of liquid metal eliminates the issue of compliance mismatch observed in soft polymers with solid fillers. 5) The silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can be assembled by DEP within the crevices of severely damaged wires to create stretchable interconnects that heal the damage mechanically and electrically. The DEP process of this unique set of materials is characterized and the interesting attributes enabled by such liquid microwires are demonstrated.

This directed assembly within a silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can heal severely damaged regions of stretchable interconnects to restore mechanical integrity and electrical conductivity.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Growing interest in soft robotics, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins has created demand for soft, compliant, and stretchable electrodes and interconnects. Here, dielectrophoresis (DEP) is used to assemble, align, and sinter eutectic gallium indium (EGaIn) microdroplets in uncured poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) to form electrically conducting microwires. There are several noteworthy aspects of this approach. 1) Generally, EGaIn droplets in silicone at loadings approaching 90 wt% remain insulating and form a conductive network only when subjected to sintering. Here, DEP facilitates assembly of EGaIn droplets into conductive microwires at loadings as low as 10 wt%. 2) DEP is done in silicone for the first time, enabling the microwires to be cured in a stretchable matrix. 3) Liquid EGaIn droplets sinter during DEP to form a stretchable metallic microwire that retains its shape after curing the silicone. 4) Use of liquid metal eliminates the issue of compliance mismatch observed in soft polymers with solid fillers. 5) The silicone&#8211;EGaIn &#8220;ink&#8221; can be assembled by DEP within the crevices of severely damaged wires to create stretchable interconnects that heal the damage mechanically and electrically. The DEP process of this unique set of materials is characterized and the interesting attributes enabled by such liquid microwires are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cs4PbI6&#8208;Mediated Synthesis of Thermodynamically Stable FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A Cs4PbI6&#8208;mediated method is developed to fabricate cesium (Cs)&#8208;rich perovskite films. It is also found that &#8776;15% alloying with the organic formamidine (FA) cation can sufficiently stabilize the perovskite phase with excellent phase and UV&#8208;irradiation stability. FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.5%.








Abstract
The stability issue is still one of the main limitations of the commercialization of perovskite photovoltaics. The mixed cation FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 has shown great promise owing to its improved thermal and moisture stability. However, the study of FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 is concentrated on formamidine (FA)&#8208;rich perovskite, whereas cesium (Cs)&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskites are barely studied due to the inevitable phase separation when Cs &gt; 30 mol%. Here, a Cs4PbI6&#8208;mediated method is developed to synthesize Cs&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskites. It is demonstrated that Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase has a low Cs cation diffusion barrier and therefore offers a fast ion exchange with the preformed FA&#8208;rich perovskite phase to finally form the Cs&#8208;rich FAxCs1&#8722;xPbI3 perovskite. The results indicate that &#8776;15% alloying with organic FA cations can sufficiently stabilize the perovskite phase with excellent phase and UV&#8208;irradiation stability. The FA0.15Cs0.85PbI3 perovskite solar cells achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 17.5%, showing the great potential of Cs&#8208;based perovskites for efficient and stable solar cells.

      <title>Hofmeister&#8208;Effect&#8208;Guided Ionohydrogel Design as Printable Bioelectronic Devices</title>
      <dc:description>
Transducing biosignals imperatively needs a hybrid circuit of mobile ions and electrons. An ionohydrogel bioelectronic platform is developed via enzymatic polymerization in hydrated ionic liquids, realizing the integration of ionic and enzymatic electronic circuits. The platform ensures the high bioactivity of enzymes and favorable ionic conductivity that are integrated into an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use glucose sensor and a wireless human&#8208;motion monitor and energy&#8208;storage device.








Abstract
Bioelectronic platforms convert biological signals into electrical signals by utilizing biocatalysts that provide tools to monitor the activity of cells and tissues. Traditional conducting materials such as solid conductors and conducting polymers are confronted with a great challenge in sophisticated production processes and mismatch at biological tissues&#8211;machine interfaces. Furthermore, the biocatalyst, the key functional component in the electron&#8208;transfer reaction for bio&#8208;signal detection denatures easily in an ionic conductive solution. Herein, a bionic strategy is elaborately developed to synthesize an ionohydrogel bioelectronic platform that possesses extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;like habitat by employing hydrated ionic liquids (HILs) as ionic solvent and bioprotectant. This strategy realizes an integration of ionic and enzymatic electronic circuits and minimization of the disparities between tissues and artificial machines. The Hofmeister effect of HILs on enzyme proteins and polymer chains ensures the high bioactivity of the enzymes and greatly improves the mechanical properties of the ionohydrogels. Moreover, hydrogen bonds formed by ILs, water, and polymer chains greatly improve the water&#8208;retention of the ionohydrogel and give it more practical significance. Consequently, the promising ionohydrogel is partly printed and fabricated into wearable devices as a pain&#8208;free humoral components monitor and a wireless motion&#8208;sensor.

      <title>An All&#8208;Scale Hierarchical Architecture Induces Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Electrocaloric Effect at Ultralow Electric Field in Polymer Nanocomposites</title>
      <dc:description>
An all&#8208;scale hierarchical approach to achieving ultrahigh electrocaloric (EC) strength in flexible polymer composites is proposed and demonstrated. The enhanced EC performance is mainly attributed to the hierarchical interfaces inside the composite nanofibers. In addition, the orthotropic configuration of the BFO@BZT_nfs inside the terpolymer matrix further increases Eb of the nanocomposite and leads to substantially enhanced EC strength under a moderate electric field.








Abstract
Composed of electrocaloric (EC) ceramics and polymers, polymer composites with high EC performances are considered as promising candidates for next&#8208;generation all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cooling devices. Their mass application is limited by the low EC strength, which requires very high operational voltage to induce appreciable temperature change. Here, an all&#8208;scale hierarchical architecture is proposed and demonstrated to achieve high EC strength in poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene&#8208;chlorofluoroethylene)&#8208;based nanocomposites. On the atomic scale, highly polarizable hierarchical interfaces are induced by incorporating BiFeO3 (BFO) nanoparticles in Ba(Zr0.21Ti0.79)O3 (BZT) nanofibers (BFO@BZT_nfs); on the microscopic scale, percolation of the interfaces further raises the polarization of the composite nanofibers; on the mesoscopic scale, orthotropic orientation of BFO@BZT_nfs leads to much enhanced breakdown strength of the nanocomposites. As a result, an ultrahigh EC strength of &#8776;0.22 K m MV&#8722;1 is obtained at an ultralow electric field of 75 MV m&#8722;1 in nanocomposites filled with the orthotropic composite nanofibers, which is by far the highest value achieved in polymer nanocomposites at a moderate electric field. Results of high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy, in situ scanning Kelvin probe microscopy characterization, and phase&#8208;field simulations all indicate that the much enhanced EC performances can be attributed to the all&#8208;scale hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite.

      <title>Identifying the Origin of Ti3+ Activity toward Enhanced Electrocatalytic N2 Reduction over TiO2 Nanoparticles Modulated by Mixed&#8208;Valent Copper</title>
      <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;doped TiO2 nanoparticles are highly active toward ambient N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 conversion with excellent selectivity. In 0.5 m LiClO4, this catalyst attains a high Faradaic efficiency of 21.99% and a large NH3 yield of 21.31 &#181;g h&#8210;1 mgcat.&#8210;1 at &#8210;0.55 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Density function theory calculations are further discussed for the N2 reduction reaction catalytic mechanism on the Cu&#8208;doped TiO2 (101) surface.








Abstract
The ambient electrocatalytic N2 reduction reaction (NRR) enabled by TiO2 has attracted extensive recent attention. Previous studies suggest the formation of Ti3+ in TiO2 can significantly improve the NRR activity, but it still remains unclear what kinds of Ti3+ are effective. Herein, it is demonstrated that mixed&#8208;valent Cu acts as an effective dopant to modulate the oxygen vacancy (VO) concentration and Ti3+ formation, which markedly improves the electrocatalytic NRR performance. In 0.5 m LiClO4, this electrocatalyst attains a high Faradic efficiency of 21.99% and a large NH3 yield of 21.31 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 at &#8211;0.55 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, which even surpasses most reported Ti&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts. Using density function theory calculations, it is evidenced that mixed&#8208;valent Cu ions modulate the TiO2 (101) surface with multiple oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for generating different Ti3+ 3d1 defect states localized below the Fermi energy. N2 activation and adsorption are effectively strengthened when Ti3+ 3d1 defect states present the splitting of eg and t2g orbitals, which can be modulated by its coordination structure. The synergistic roles of the three ion pairs formed by the VO defect, including Cu1+&#8211;Ti4+, Ti3+&#8211;Ti4+ and Ti3+&#8211;Ti3+, are together responsible for the enhanced NRR performance.

In 0.5 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m &lt;/span&gt; LiClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, this electrocatalyst attains a high Faradic efficiency of 21.99% and a large NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 21.31 &#181;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sub&gt;cat.&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at &#8211;0.55 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode, which even surpasses most reported Ti&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts. Using density function theory calculations, it is evidenced that mixed&#8208;valent Cu ions modulate the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (101) surface with multiple oxygen vacancies, which is beneficial for generating different Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;i&gt;d &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; defect states localized below the Fermi energy. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation and adsorption are effectively strengthened when Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; 3&lt;i&gt;d &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; defect states present the splitting of e&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt; and t&lt;sub&gt;2g&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals, which can be modulated by its coordination structure. The synergistic roles of the three ion pairs formed by the V&lt;sub&gt;O&lt;/sub&gt; defect, including Cu&lt;sup&gt;1+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Ti&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;Ti&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, are together responsible for the enhanced NRR performance.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Anion Substitution in Porous Aromatic Frameworks: Boosting Molecular Permeability and Selectivity for Membrane Acetylene Separation</title>
      <dc:description>
The strategy of anion substitution is proposed to infix hydroxide anions in the pores of porous aromatic frameworks (PAFs). These alkaline anions preferentially and massively adsorb acidic acetylene molecules, enabling both good selectivity and high permeability for acetylene over ethylene and ethane through the PAF&#8208;based membranes.








Abstract
Precise tailoring of pore chemistry is indispensable for efficient membrane gas separation, particularly for the challenging acetylene system. Here, a strategy called &#8220;anion substitution&#8221; is reported, to strengthen the interaction between anions and acetylene within the pores, for radically improving gas selectivity and permeability. The anions F&#8722; and OH&#8722; are infixed in iPAF&#8208;1 to replace the original Cl&#8722; ion. Their small anionic radii allow retention of the original high porosity of iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;Cl in iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;F and iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH. Highly basic F&#8722; and OH&#8722; confined in the pores attract acidic acetylene strongly and preferentially. Nanoparticles of iPAF&#8208;1 are processed to form mixed matrix membranes, represented by iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH/6FDA&#8208;ODA. The prepared membranes exhibit remarkable performance in separating acetylene from ethylene and ethane. Transplantation of porous and functional iPAF&#8208;1&#8208;OH into 6FDA&#8208;ODA significantly enhances both acetylene permeability (sevenfold) and permselectivity (fivefold) for acetylene over ethylene and ethane, which is crucial for membrane acetylene gas separation.

Abstract
Magnetic nanoparticles are currently the focus of investigation for a wide range of biomedical applications that fall into the categories of imaging, sensing, and therapeutics. A deep understanding of nanoparticle magnetization dynamics is fundamental to optimization and further development of these applications. Here, a summary of theoretical models of nanoparticle dynamics is presented, and computational nonequilibrium models are outlined, which currently represent the most sophisticated methods for modeling nanoparticle dynamics. Nanoparticle magnetization response is explored in depth; the effect of applied field amplitude, as well as nanoparticle size, on the resulting rotation mechanism and timescale is investigated. Two applications in biomedicine, magnetic particle imaging and magnetic fluid hyperthermia, are highlighted.

      <title>Core&#8211;Shell Structured Nanoenergetic Materials: Preparation and Fundamental Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
The &#8220;shell&#8221; of core&#8211;shell structured explosives is like a protective &#8220;coat&#8221; on the sensitive explosive, making them more resistant to external stimuli. The fuel and oxidizer in core&#8211;shell structured metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are like a well&#8208;matched &#8220;gear,&#8221; they have large and close contact with each other, so that the thermite reaction exhibits increased heat output and improved reactivity.








Abstract
Energetic materials, including explosives, pyrotechnics, and propellants, are widely used in mining, demolition, automobile airbags, fireworks, ordnance, and space technology. Nanoenergetic materials (nEMs) have a high reaction rate and high energy density, which are both adjustable to a large extent. Structural control over nEMs to achieve improved performance and multifunctionality leads to a fascinating research area, namely, nanostructured energetic materials. Among them, core&#8211;shell structured nEMs have gained considerable attention due to their improved material properties and combined multiple functionalities. Various nEMs with core&#8211;shell structures have been developed through diverse synthesis routes, among which core&#8211;shell structured nEMs associated with explosives and metastable intermolecular composites (MICs) are extensively studied due to their good tunability and wide applications, as well as excellent energetic (e.g., enhanced heat release and combustion) and/or mechanical properties. Herein, the preparation methods and fundamental properties of the abovementioned kinds of core&#8211;shell structured nEMs are summarized and the reasons behind the satisfactory performance clarified, based on which suggestions regarding possible future research directions are proposed.

      <title>Why Cellulose&#8208;Based Electrochemical Energy Storage Devices?</title>
      <dc:description>
The recent progress of cellulose, as an appealing natural material that can outperform traditional synthetic materials, for use in energy&#8208;storage devices is described. Cellulose can bring benefits in the fabrication and properties of energy&#8208;storage materials and devices, eventually enabling significant improvements in electrochemical performance, mechanical flexibility, cost competitiveness, and form factors, which are difficult to achieve with conventional power source technologies.








Abstract
Recent findings demonstrate that cellulose, a highly abundant, versatile, sustainable, and inexpensive material, can be used in the preparation of very stable and flexible electrochemical energy storage devices with high energy and power densities by using electrodes with high mass loadings, composed of conducting composites with high surface areas and thin layers of electroactive material, as well as cellulose&#8208;based current collectors and functional separators. Close attention should, however, be paid to the properties of the cellulose (e.g., porosity, pore distribution, pore&#8208;size distribution, and crystallinity). The manufacturing of cellulose&#8208;based electrodes and all&#8208;cellulose devices is also well&#8208;suited for large&#8208;scale production since it can be made using straightforward filtration&#8208;based techniques or paper&#8208;making approaches, as well as utilizing various printing techniques. Herein, the recent development and possibilities associated with the use of cellulose are discussed, regarding the manufacturing of electrochemical energy storage devices comprising electrodes with high energy and power densities and lightweight current collectors and functional separators.

On the basis of improved wetting and stabilized interfacial chemistry, such liquid metal batteries deliver stable cycling performance and negligible self&#8208;discharge, which is promising for grid&#8208;scale energy storage.








Abstract
Liquid metal batteries are regarded as potential electrochemical systems for stationary energy storage. Currently, all reported liquid metal batteries need to be operated at temperatures above 240 &#176;C to maintain the metallic electrodes in a molten state. Here, an unprecedented room&#8208;temperature liquid metal battery employing a sodium&#8211;potassium (Na&#8211;K) alloy anode and gallium (Ga)&#8208;based alloy cathodes is demonstrated. Compared with lead (Pb)&#8208; and mercury (Hg)&#8208;based liquid metal electrodes, the nontoxic Ga alloys maintain high environmental benignity. On the basis of improved wetting and stabilized interfacial chemistry, such liquid metal batteries deliver stable cycling performance and negligible self&#8208;discharge. Different from the conventional interphase between a typical solid electrode and a liquid electrolyte, the interphase between a liquid metal and a liquid electrolyte is directly visualized via advanced 3D chemical analysis. Insights into this new type of liquid electrode/electrolyte interphase reveal its important role in regulating charge carriers and stabilizing the redox chemistry. With facile cell fabrication, simplified battery structures, high safety, and low maintenance costs, room&#8208;temperature liquid metal batteries not only show great prospects for widespread applications, but also offer a pathway toward developing innovative energy&#8208;storage devices beyond conventional solid&#8208;state batteries or high&#8208;temperature batteries.

      <title>The Effect of Thiol Structure on Allyl Sulfide Photodegradable Hydrogels and their Application as a Degradable Scaffold for Organoid Passaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Allyl sulfide photodegradable hydrogels support the formation of epithelial colonies from encapsulated single intestinal stem cells, maintaining their potential to proliferate and differentiate. Rapid photodegradation afforded by allyl sulfide exchange offers the ability to repetitively passage colonies, providing an alternative to commonly used, animal&#8208;derived matrices for intestinal organoid culture.








Abstract
Intestinal organoids are useful in vitro models for basic and translational studies aimed at understanding and treating disease. However, their routine culture relies on animal&#8208;derived matrices that limit translation to clinical applications. In fact, there are few fully defined, synthetic hydrogel systems that allow for the expansion of intestinal organoids. Here, an allyl sulfide photodegradable hydrogel is presented, achieving rapid degradation through radical addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (AFCT) reactions, to support routine passaging of intestinal organoids. Shear rheology to first characterize the effect of thiol and allyl sulfide crosslink structures on degradation kinetics is used. Irradiation with 365 nm light (5 mW cm&#8722;2) in the presence of a soluble thiol (glutathione at 15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m), and a photoinitiator (lithium phenyl&#8208;2,4,6&#8208;trimethylbenzoylphosphinate at 1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 m), leads to complete hydrogel degradation in less than 15 s. Allyl sulfide hydrogels are used to support the formation of epithelial colonies from single intestinal stem cells, and rapid photodegradation is used to achieve repetitive passaging of stem cell colonies without loss in morphology or organoid formation potential. This platform could support long&#8208;term culture of intestinal organoids, potentially replacing the need for animal&#8208;derived matrices, while also allowing systematic variations to the hydrogel properties tailored for the organoid of interest.

      <title>Combining Qdot Nanotechnology and DNA Nanotechnology for Sensitive Single&#8208;Cell Imaging</title>
      <dc:description>
Highly multiplexed and high&#8208;sensitivity immunohistochemistry imaging is achieved by combining Qdot nanotechnology with DNA nanotechnology. The Qdots' unique optical properties and primer exchange reaction's programmability allow rapid, sensitive, and specific immunostaining in single cells.








Abstract
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) can provide detailed information about protein expression within the cell microenvironment and is one of the most common techniques in biology and medicine due to the broad availability of highly specific antibodies and well&#8208;established bioconjugation methods for modification of these antibodies with chromogens and fluorophores. Despite recent advances in this field, it remains challenging to simultaneously achieve high multiplexing, sensitivity, and throughput in single&#8208;cell profiling experiments. Here, the combination of two powerful technologies is reported, quantum dot and signal amplification by exchange reaction (QD&#8208;SABER), for sensitive and multiplexed imaging of endogenous proteins. Compared to the conventional IHC process using dye&#8208;labeled secondary antibodies (which already has a built&#8208;in signal amplification mechanism), QD&#8208;SABER provides an additional 7.6&#8208;fold signal amplification. In addition, the DNA hybridization&#8208;based IHC can be rapidly removed to regenerate the sample for subsequent cycles of immunostaining (&gt;10 cycles), greatly expanding the multiplexing capability.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2019076901907690&lt;/a&gt;, Zhigang Geng, Jie Zeng, and co&#8208;workers report a fluorine&#8208;doped 3D porous carbon framework as a highly efficient metal&#8208;free catalyst toward N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction. F&#8208;bonding to carbon atoms creates a Lewis acid site to enhance the repulsive interaction with protons for suppressing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, thus enhancing the selectivity of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electroreduction into NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <title>Engineered Cell&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles Directly Present Tumor Antigens to Promote Anticancer Immunity</title>
      <dc:description>
Cancer cells are genetically engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker that enables them to directly present their own antigens under an immunostimulatory context. Cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles sourced from these modified cells elicit antitumor immunity in vivo while bypassing the need for traditional cell&#8208;mediated antigen presentation. This approach may ultimately enable the facile design of personalized artificial antigen presentation platforms.








Abstract
The recent success of immunotherapies has highlighted the power of leveraging the immune system in the fight against cancer. In order for most immune&#8208;based therapies to succeed, T cell subsets with the correct tumor&#8208;targeting specificities must be mobilized. When such specificities are lacking, providing the immune system with tumor antigen material for processing and presentation is a common strategy for stimulating antigen&#8208;specific T cell populations. While straightforward in principle, experience has shown that manipulation of the antigen presentation process can be incredibly complex, necessitating sophisticated strategies that are difficult to translate. Herein, the design of a biomimetic nanoparticle platform is reported that can be used to directly stimulate T cells without the need for professional antigen&#8208;presenting cells. The nanoparticles are fabricated using a cell membrane coating derived from cancer cells engineered to express a co&#8208;stimulatory marker. Combined with the peptide epitopes naturally presented on the membrane surface, the final formulation contains the necessary signals to promote tumor antigen&#8208;specific immune responses, priming T cells that can be used to control tumor growth. The reported approach represents an emerging strategy that can be used to develop multiantigenic, personalized cancer immunotherapies.

      <title>Coupling a Crystal Graph Multilayer Descriptor to Active Learning for Rapid Discovery of 2D Ferromagnetic Semiconductors/Half&#8208;Metals/Metals</title>
      <dc:description>
An adaptive framework with the combination of machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques and high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations is designed to discover novel 2D ferromagnetic semiconductors, half&#8208;metals, and metals. Additionally, a new universal material descriptor is proposed for thermal, magnetic, and electronic properties of diverse 2D materials, with which ML models achieve high prediction accuracy over 90%.








Abstract
2D ferromagnetic (FM) semiconductors/half&#8208;metals/metals are the key materials toward next&#8208;generation spintronic devices. However, such materials are still rather rare and the material search space is too large to explore exhaustively. Here, an adaptive framework to accelerate the discovery of 2D intrinsic FM materials is developed, by combining advanced machine&#8208;learning (ML) techniques with high&#8208;throughput density functional theory calculations. Successfully, about 90 intrinsic FM materials with desirable bandgap and excellent thermodynamic stability are screened out and a database containing 1459 2D magnetic materials is set up. To improve the performance of ML models on small&#8208;scale datasets like diverse 2D materials, a crystal graph multilayer descriptor using the elemental property is proposed, with which ML models achieve prediction accuracy over 90% on thermodynamic stability, magnetism, and bandgap. This study not only provides dozens of compelling FM candidates for future spintronics, but also paves a feasible route for ML&#8208;based rapid screening of diverse structures and/or complex properties.

      <title>Mesoporous PdAg Nanospheres for Stable Electrochemical CO2 Reduction to Formate</title>
      <dc:description>
Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres can enable electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high activity, selectivity, and most remarkably excellent stability superior to most previous reports. The great performance is believed to arise from the strong electronic coupling between Pd and Ag upon alloying, which effectively alleviates the CO poisoning on surface.








Abstract
Palladium is a promising material for electrochemical CO2 reduction to formate with high Faradaic efficiency near the equilibrium potential. It unfortunately suffers from problematic operation stability due to CO poisoning on surface. Here, it is demonstrated that alloying is an effective strategy to alleviate this problem. Mesoporous PdAg nanospheres with uniform size and composition are prepared from the co&#8208;reduction of palladium and silver precursors in aqueous solution using dioctadecyldimethylammonium chloride as the structure&#8208;directing agent. The best candidate can initiate CO2 reduction at zero overpotential and achieve high formate selectivity close to 100% and great stability even at &lt;&#8208;0.2 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. The high selectivity and stability are believed to result from the electronic coupling between Pd and Ag, which lowers the d&#8208;band center of Pd and thereby significantly enhances its CO tolerance, as evidenced by both electrochemical analysis and theoretical simulations.

      <title>Electro&#8208;Optic Upconversion in van der Waals Heterostructures via Nonequilibrium Photocarrier Tunneling</title>
      <dc:description>
Nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor van der Waals heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and monolayer tungsten disulfide. The photocarrier transport dynamics governed by Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling are electrically tunable by two orders of magnitude using voltage bias applied to the device.








Abstract
Ultrafast interlayer charge transfer is one of the most distinct features of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. Its dynamics competes with carrier thermalization such that the energy of nonthermalized photocarriers may be harnessed by band engineering. In this study, nonthermalized photocarrier energy is harnessed to achieve near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to visible light upconversion in a metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (MIS) vdW heterostructure tunnel diode consisting of few&#8208;layer graphene (FLG), hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), and monolayer tungsten disulfide (WS2). Photoexcitation of the electrically biased heterostructure with 1.58 eV NIR laser in the linear absorption regime generates emission from the ground exciton state of WS2, which corresponds to upconversion by &#8776;370 meV. The upconversion is realized by electrically assisted interlayer transfer of nonthermalized photoexcited holes from FLG to WS2, followed by formation and radiative recombination of excitons in WS2. The photocarrier transfer rate can be described by Fowler&#8211;Nordheim tunneling mechanism and is electrically tunable by two orders of magnitude by tuning voltage bias applied to the device. This study highlights the prospects for realizing novel electro&#8208;optic upconversion devices by exploiting electrically tunable nonthermalized photocarrier relaxation dynamics in vdW heterostructures.

      <title>Gas Diffusion Strategy for Inserting Atomic Iron Sites into Graphitized Carbon Supports for Unusually High&#8208;Efficient CO2 Electroreduction and High&#8208;Performance Zn&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A universal gas diffusion strategy is developed for fabricating a series of single&#8208;atom catalysts with atomic Fe sites at trace amount supported by dimension&#8208;controlled graphitized carbons. Benefitting from highly catalytic active isolated Fe&#8208;N3 sites and graphitic N species, the optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 exhibits superior CO2 electroreduction activity and outstanding Zn&#8211;CO2 battery performance.








Abstract
Emerging single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) hold great promise for CO2 electroreduction (CO2ER), but the design of highly active and cost&#8208;efficient SACs is still challenging. Herein, a gas diffusion strategy, along with one&#8208;step thermal activation, for fabricating N&#8208;doped porous carbon polyhedrons with trace isolated Fe atoms (Fe1NC) is developed. The optimized Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 with atomic Fe&#8208;N3 sites supported by N&#8208;doped graphitic carbons exhibits superior CO2ER performance with the CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96% at &#8722;0.5 V, turnover frequency of 2225 h&#8722;1, and outstanding stability, outperforming almost all previously reported SACs based on N&#8208;doped carbon supported nonprecious metals. The observed excellent CO2ER performance is attributed to the greatly enhanced accessibility and intrinsic activity of active centers due to the increased electrochemical surface area through size modulation and the redistribution of doped N species by thermal activation. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe&#8208;N3 sites possess balanced adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO intermediates, facilitating CO formation. A universal gas diffusion strategy is used to exclusively yield a series of dimension&#8208;controlled carbon&#8208;supported SACs with single Fe atoms while a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO2 battery with Fe1NC/S1&#8208;1000 as cathode is developed to deliver a maximal power density of 0.6 mW cm&#8722;2.

The optimized Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;NC/S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;1000 with atomic Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites supported by N&#8208;doped graphitic carbons exhibits superior CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER performance with the CO Faradaic efficiency up to 96% at &#8722;0.5 V, turnover frequency of 2225 h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and outstanding stability, outperforming almost all previously reported SACs based on N&#8208;doped carbon supported nonprecious metals. The observed excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ER performance is attributed to the greatly enhanced accessibility and intrinsic activity of active centers due to the increased electrochemical surface area through size modulation and the redistribution of doped N species by thermal activation. Experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the Fe&#8208;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; sites possess balanced adsorption energies of *COOH and *CO intermediates, facilitating CO formation. A universal gas diffusion strategy is used to exclusively yield a series of dimension&#8208;controlled carbon&#8208;supported SACs with single Fe atoms while a rechargeable Zn&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with Fe&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;NC/S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;1000 as cathode is developed to deliver a maximal power density of 0.6 mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Controllable Singlet&#8211;Triplet Energy Splitting of Graphene Quantum Dots through Oxidation: From Phosphorescence to TADF</title>
      <dc:description>
Oxidation control of graphene quantum dots can tune singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting, which induces a dramatic afterglow transition from phosphorescence to thermally activated delayed fluorescence. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to such afterglow emissions. A new design approach for engineering singlet&#8208;triplet energy splitting through facile molecular manipulation will enable the realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.








Abstract
Long&#8208;lived afterglow emissions, such as room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) and thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), are beneficial in the fields of displays, bioimaging, and data security. However, it is challenging to realize a single material that simultaneously exhibits both RTP and TADF properties with their relative strengths varied in a controlled manner. Herein, a new design approach is reported to control singlet&#8211;triplet energy splitting (&#8710;EST) in graphene quantum dots (GQD)/graphene oxide quantum dots (GOQDs) by varying the ratio of oxygenated carbon to sp2 carbon (&#947;OC). It is demonstrated that &#8710;EST decreases from 0.365 to 0.123 eV as &#947;OC increases from 4.63% to 59.6%, which in turn induces a dramatic transition from RTP to TADF. Matrix&#8208;assisted stabilization of triplet excited states provides ultralong lifetimes to both RTP and TADF. Embedded in boron oxynitride, the low oxidized (4.63%) GQD exhibits an RTP lifetime (&#964;Tavg) of 783 ms, and the highly oxidized (59.6%) GOQD exhibits a TADF lifetime (&#964;DFavg) of 125 ms. Furthermore, the long&#8208;lived RTP and TADF materials enable the first demonstration of anticounterfeiting and multilevel information security using GQD. These results will open up a new approach to the engineering of singlet&#8211;triplet splitting in GQD for controlled realization of smart multimodal afterglow materials.

      <title>Plant Nanomaterials and Inspiration from Nature: Water Interactions and Hierarchically Structured Hydrogels</title>
      <dc:description>
Inspired from nature, wood&#8208;based and man&#8208;made hydrogels are produced taking advantage of the properties and structure of elements present in the cell walls of plants, including (nano)celluloses. They endow new materials with features that include directionality, hierarchy, responsiveness, and function, all of which are associated to the composition and morphology of the building blocks.








Abstract
Recent developments in the area of plant&#8208;based hydrogels are introduced, especially those derived from wood as a widely available, multiscale, and hierarchical source of nanomaterials, as well as other cell wall elements. With water being fundamental in a hydrogel, water interactions, hydration, and swelling, all critically important in designing, processing, and achieving the desired properties of sustainable and functional hydrogels, are highlighted. A plant, by itself, is a form of a hydrogel, at least at given states of development, and for this reason phenomena such as fluid transport, diffusion, capillarity, and ionic effects are examined. These aspects are highly relevant not only to plants, especially lignified tissues, but also to the porous structures produced after removal of water (foams, sponges, cryogels, xerogels, and aerogels). Thus, a useful source of critical and comprehensive information is provided regarding the synthesis of hydrogels from plant materials (and especially wood nanostructures), and about the role of water, not only for processing but for developing hydrogel properties and uses.

      <title>Changes of Structure and Bonding with Thickness in Chalcogenide Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A first&#8208;principles study of the structure, bonding, and ferroelectricity in quasi 2D monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, SnTe) is carried out. It is found that a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior in selenides, while the tellurides deviate strongly from the bulk, even for thick models. These differences stem from the effects of depolarizing fields and the different bonding mechanisms.








Abstract
Extreme miniaturization is known to be detrimental for certain properties, such as ferroelectricity in perovskite oxide films below a critical thickness. Remarkably, few&#8208;layer crystalline films of monochalcogenides display robust in&#8208;plane ferroelectricity with potential applications in nanoelectronics. These applications critically depend on the electronic properties and the nature of bonding in the 2D limit. A fundamental open question is thus to what extent bulk properties persist in thin films. Here, this question is addressed by a first&#8208;principles study of the structural, electronic, and ferroelectric properties of selected monochalcogenides (GeSe, GeTe, SnSe, and SnTe) as a function of film thickness up to 18 bilayers. While in selenides a few bilayers are sufficient to recover the bulk behavior, the Te&#8208;based compounds deviate strongly from the bulk, irrespective of the slab thickness. These results are explained in terms of depolarizing fields in Te&#8208;based slabs and the different nature of the chemical bond in selenides and tellurides. It is shown that GeTe and SnTe slabs inherit metavalent bonding of the bulk phase, despite structural and electronic properties being strongly modified in thin films. This understanding of the nature of bonding in few&#8208;layers structures offers a powerful tool to tune materials properties for applications in information technology.

      <title>Lipid&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Supported 3D Printing of Human Cerebral Cortex Cells Reveals Developmental Interactions</title>
      <dc:description>
The human cerebral cortex contains distinguishable cell arrangements that are important for brain function. The 3D droplet printing technique reported allows the assembly of human cortical neurons and glial cells into defined patterns in extracellular matrix. The engineered human cortical tissues are functional and able to recapitulate aspects of brain development.








Abstract
Current understanding of human brain development is rudimentary due to suboptimal in vitro and animal models. In particular, how initial cell positions impact subsequent human cortical development is unclear because experimental spatial control of cortical cell arrangement is technically challenging. 3D cell printing provides a rapid customized approach for patterning. However, it has relied on materials that do not represent the extracellular matrix (ECM) of brain tissue. Therefore, in the present work, a lipid&#8208;bilayer&#8208;supported printing technique is developed to 3D print human cortical cells in the soft, biocompatible ECM, Matrigel. Printed human neural stem cells (hNSCs) show high viability, neural differentiation, and the formation of functional, stimulus&#8208;responsive neural networks. By using prepatterned arrangements of neurons and astrocytes, it is found that hNSC process outgrowth and migration into cell&#8208;free matrix and into astrocyte&#8208;containing matrix are similar in extent. However, astrocytes enhance the later developmental event of axon bundling. Both young and mature neurons migrate into compartments containing astrocytes; in contrast, astrocytes do not migrate into neuronal domains signifying nonreciprocal chemorepulsion. Therefore, precise prepatterning by 3D printing allows the construction of natural and unnatural patterns that yield important insights into human cerebral cortex development.

      <title>Ligand Diffusion Enables Force&#8208;Independent Cell Adhesion via Activating &#945;5&#946;1 Integrin and Initiating Rac and RhoA Signaling</title>
      <dc:description>
Cell adhesion and stem cell fate specification exhibit unexpected behaviors in response to ligand diffusivity. Fast ligand diffusion enables cell adhesion independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. An atypical pathway utilizing &#945;5&#946;1 integrin, RhoA, and Rac is detected to induce cell adhesion in such situations where &#945;v&#946;3 integrin&#8208;related mechanotransduction pathways are inactive.








Abstract
Cells reside in a dynamic microenvironment in which adhesive ligand availability, density, and diffusivity are key factors regulating cellular behavior. Here, the cellular response to integrin&#8208;binding ligand dynamics by directly controlling ligand diffusivity via tunable ligand&#8211;surface interactions is investigated. Interestingly, cell spread on the surfaces with fast ligand diffusion is independent of myosin&#8208;based force generation. Fast ligand diffusion enhances &#945;5&#946;1 but not &#945;v&#946;3 integrin activation and initiates Rac and RhoA but not ROCK signaling, resulting in lamellipodium&#8208;based fast cell spreading. Meanwhile, on surfaces with immobile ligands, &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins synergistically initiate intracellular&#8208;force&#8208;based canonical mechanotransduction pathways to enhance cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. These results indicate the presence of heretofore&#8208;unrecognized pathways, distinct from canonical actomyosin&#8208;driven mechanisms, that are capable of promoting cell adhesion.

Fast ligand diffusion enhances &#945;5&#946;1 but not &#945;v&#946;3 integrin activation and initiates Rac and RhoA but not ROCK signaling, resulting in lamellipodium&#8208;based fast cell spreading. Meanwhile, on surfaces with immobile ligands, &#945;v&#946;3 and &#945;5&#946;1 integrins synergistically initiate intracellular&#8208;force&#8208;based canonical mechanotransduction pathways to enhance cell adhesion and osteogenic differentiation of stem cells. These results indicate the presence of heretofore&#8208;unrecognized pathways, distinct from canonical actomyosin&#8208;driven mechanisms, that are capable of promoting cell adhesion.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biodegradable Laser Arrays Self&#8208;Assembled from Plant Resources</title>
      <dc:description>
The study demonstrates sustainable, switchable, and biodegradable laser devices self&#8208;assembled from cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) as the resonator and dye&#8208;doped water&#8208;soluble polymers as the gain medium.








Abstract
The transition toward future sustainable societies largely depends on disruptive innovations in biobased materials to substitute nonsustainable advanced functional materials. In the field of optics, advanced devices (e.g., lasers or metamaterial devices) are typically manufactured using top&#8208;down engineering and synthetic materials. This work breaks with such concepts and switchable lasers self&#8208;assembled from plant&#8208;based cellulose nanocrystals and fluorescent polymers at room temperature and from water are shown. Controlled structure formation allows laser&#8208;grade cholesteric photonic bandgap materials, in which the photonic bandgap is matched to the fluorescence emission to function as an efficient resonator for low threshold multimode lasing. The lasers can be switched on and off using humidity, and can be printed into pixelated arrays. Additionally, the materials exhibit stiffness above typical thermoplastic polymers and biodegradability in soil. The concept showcases that highly advanced functions can be encoded into biobased materials, and opens the design space for future sustainable optical devices of unprecedented function.

      <title>Piezocatalytic Tumor Therapy by Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and BaTiO3&#8208;Mediated Piezoelectricity</title>
      <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic tumor therapy initiated by piezoelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 (T&#8208;BTO) nanoparticles confined by thermogel under ultrasound irradiation is demonstrated. Band alignment modulation resulting from piezopotential tilts the band to the energetically favorable side. Subsequently, electrons and holes are separated and piezocatalyze the &#8226;OH and &#8226;O2&#8722; generation for tumor eradication.








Abstract
Ultrasound theranostics features non&#8208;invasiveness, minor energy attenuation, and high tissue&#8208;penetrating capability, and is playing ever&#8208;important roles in the diagnosis and therapy of diseases in clinics. Herein, ultrasound is employed as a microscopic pressure resource to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) for piezocatalytic tumor therapy under catalytic mediation by piezoelectric tetragonal BaTiO3 (T&#8208;BTO). Under the ultrasonic vibration, the electrons and holes are unpaired and they are separated by the piezoelectricity, resulting in the establishment of a strong built&#8208;in electric field, which subsequently catalyzes the generation of ROS such as toxic hydroxyl (&#8226;OH) and superoxide radicals (&#8226;O2&#8722;) in situ for tumor eradication. This modality shows intriguing advantages over typical sonoluminescence&#8208;activated sonodynamic therapy, such as more stable sensitizers and dynamical control of redox reaction outcomes. Furthermore, according to the finite element modeling simulation, the built&#8208;in electric field is capable of modulating the band alignment to make the toxic ROS generation energetically favorable. Both detailed in vitro cellular level evaluation and in vivo tumor xenograft assessment have demonstrated that an injectable T&#8208;BTO&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;embedded thermosensitive hydrogel will substantially induce ultrasound irradiation&#8208;triggered cytotoxicity and piezocatalytic tumor eradication, accompanied by high therapeutic biosafety in vivo.

      <dc:description>
Owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, cellulose nanomaterials are highly attractive supporting substrate materials in solar evaporators for sustainable desalination. The physiochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles and natural cellulose are discussed, and recent progress in utilizing cellulose&#8208;based materials such as wood, bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanofibrils, air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric in solar desalination is summarized.








Abstract
Herein, the recent advances in realizing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators for alleviating the global water crisis are summarized. Fresh water scarcity is one of the most threatening issues for sustainable development. Solar steam generation, which harnesses the abundant sunlight, has been recognized as a sustainable approach to harvest fresh water. In contrast to synthetic polymeric materials that can pose serious negative environmental impacts, cellulose&#8208;based materials, owing to their biocompatibility, renewability, and sustainability, are highly attractive for realizing solar steam generators. The molecular and macromolecular features of cellulose and the physicochemical properties of extracted cellulose nanoparticles (cellulose nanocrystals and cellulose nanofibrils (CNF)) and natural cellulose materials (wood and bacterial nanocellulose (BNC)) that make them attractive as supporting substrate materials in solar steam generators are briefly discussed. Recent progress in designing highly efficient cellulose&#8208;based solar evaporators, including utilizing extracted cellulose nanoparticles via bottom&#8208;up assembly CNF, natural cellulose materials with intrinsic hierarchical structure (wood and BNC), and commercial planar cellulose substrates (air&#8208;laid paper, cellulose paper, and cotton fabric) is reviewed. The outstanding challenges that need to be addressed for these materials and devices to be utilized in the real&#8208;world and in overcoming global water crisis are also briefly highlighted.

      <title>Micro&#8208; and Nanopatterning of Halide Perovskites Where Crystal Engineering for Emerging Photoelectronics Meets Integrated Device Array Technology</title>
      <dc:description>
Micro&#8208; and nanopatterned halide perovskites (HPs) have recently attracted significant attention due to their controllable photophysical properties and unprecedented photoelectronic functionalities. A comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art micro&#8208; and nanopatterning technologies based on top&#8208;down lithography and bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembled structures is provided. The technological use of structured HPs is also discussed.








Abstract
Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing thin film halide perovskites (HPs) for use in high&#8208;performance photoelectronic devices, including solar cells, displays, and photodetectors. Furthermore, structured HPs with periodic micro&#8208; or nanopatterns have recently attracted significant interest due to their potential to not only improve the efficiency of an individual device via the controlled arrangement of HP crystals into a confined geometry, but also to technologically pixelate the device into arrays suitable for future commercialization. However, micro&#8208; or nanopatterning of HPs is not usually compatible with conventional photolithography, which is detrimental to ionic HPs and requires special techniques. Herein, a comprehensive overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies used to develop micro&#8208; and nanometer&#8208;scale HP patterns, with an emphasis on their controlled microstructures based on top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches, and their potential for future applications, is provided. Top&#8208;down approaches include modified conventional lithographic techniques and soft&#8208;lithographic methods, while bottom&#8208;up approaches include template&#8208;assisted patterning of HPs based on lithographically defined prepatterns and self&#8208;assembly. HP patterning is shown here to not only improve device performance, but also to reveal the unprecedented functionality of HPs, leading to new research areas that utilize their novel photophysical properties.

      <title>Near&#8208;Unity Polarization of Valley&#8208;Dependent Second&#8208;Harmonic Generation in Stacked TMDC Layers and Heterostructures at Room Temperature</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced SHG intensity with near&#8208;unity polarization from inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;broken 2D TMDC atomic layers, spiral structures, and heterostructures are realized at room temperature.

Abstract
With unique valley&#8208;dependent optical and optoelectronic properties, 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDCs) are promising materials for valleytronics. Second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) in 2D TMDCs monolayers has shown valley&#8208;dependent optical selection rules. However, SHG in monolayer TMDCs is generally weak; it is important to obtain materials with both strong SHG signals and a large degree of polarization. In the work, a variety of inversion&#8208;symmetry&#8208;breaking (3R&#8208;like phase) TMDCs (WSe2, WS2, MoS2) atomic layers, spiral structures, and heterostructures are prepared, and their SHG polarization is studied. Through circular&#8208;polarization&#8208;resolved SHG experiments, it is demonstrated that the SHG intensity is enhanced in thicker samples by breaking inversion symmetry while maintaining the degree of polarization close to unity at room temperature. By studying TMDCs with different twist angles and the spiral structures, it is found that there is no significant effect of multilayer interlayer interaction on valley&#8208;dependent SHG. The realization of strong SHG with high degree of polarization may pave the way toward a new platform for nonlinear optical valleytronics devices based on 2D semiconductors.

      <title>Large Single&#8208;Crystal Cu Foils with High&#8208;Index Facets by Strain&#8208;Engineered Anomalous Grain Growth</title>
      <dc:description>
Large single&#8208;crystal Cu foils with high&#8208;index facets are successfully achieved by using strain&#8208;engineered anomalous grain growth, in which a graphite susceptor provides moderate strain on the Cu foil. The minimization of the strain energy leads to the formation of anomalous Cu grains with high&#8208;index facets, which is investigated by the theoretical calculations.








Abstract
The rich and complex arrangements of metal atoms in high&#8208;index metal facets afford appealing physical and chemical properties, which attracts extensive research interest in material science for the applications in catalysis and surface chemistry. However, it is still a challenge to prepare large&#8208;area high&#8208;index single crystals in a controllable and cost&#8208;efficient manner. Herein, entire commercially available decimeter&#8208;sized polycrystalline Cu foils are successfully transformed into single crystals with a series of high&#8208;index facets, relying on a strain&#8208;engineered anomalous grain growth technique. The introduction of a moderate thermal&#8208;contact stress upon the Cu foil during the annealing leads to the formation of high&#8208;index grains dominated by the thermal strain of the Cu foils, rather than the (111) surface driven by the surface energy. Besides, the designed static gradient of the temperature enables the as&#8208;formed high&#8208;index grain seed to expand throughout the entire Cu foil. The as&#8208;received high&#8208;index Cu foils can serve as the templates for producing high&#8208;index single&#8208;crystal Cu&#8208;based alloys. This work provides an appealing material basis for the epitaxial growth of 2D materials, and the applications that require the unique surface structures of high&#8208;index metal foils and their alloys.

      <title>Direct Conversion of Rice Husks to Nanostructured SiC/C for CO2 Photoreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A one&#8208;step and template&#8208;free molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical method efficiently converts rice husks to SiC nanowires/C for enhanced CO2 photoreduction, which in theory bridges a closed&#8208;loop carbon cycle in the whole production&#8211;utilization of biomass. This nanostructured SiC nanowires/C composite shows much enhanced activity for CO2 photoreduction to CO without employing any cocatalyst or sacrificial agents.








Abstract
A one&#8208;step and template&#8208;free synthesis of a SiC nanowires/C (SiC&#8208;NW/C) composite from rice husks (RHs) is realized via a molten&#8208;salt&#8208;assisted electrochemical method. The process integrates simultaneously carbonization, electrodeoxidation, nanostructuring, and self&#8208;purification for converting RHs to a SiC&#8208;NW/C hybrid that is assembled from SiC NWs embedded in porous N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon with strong coupling. The SiC&#8208;NW/C nanostructure enables efficient CO2 adsorption and fast separation and transfer of charge carriers. Benefiting from the structural and compositional merits, the SiC&#8208;NW/C composite shows superior activity for photoreduction of CO2 to CO, in the absence of any additional cocatalysts or sacrificial agents. The process proposed herein might help to bridge a closed&#8208;loop carbon cycle in the whole production&#8211;utilization of biomass.

      <title>Thermomechanical Nanocutting of 2D Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
A thermomechanical lithography technique for direct nanocutting of 2D materials is demonstrated. A heated scanning nanotip performs the cutting of the 2D material by thermomechanically cleaving the chemical bonds in concert with the rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath. A resolution of 20 nm is obtained in monolayer MoTe2, MoS2, and MoSe2.








Abstract
Atomically thin materials, such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides, are promising candidates for future applications in micro/nanodevices and systems. For most applications, functional nanostructures have to be patterned by lithography. Developing lithography techniques for 2D materials is essential for system integration and wafer&#8208;scale manufacturing. Here, a thermomechanical indentation technique is demonstrated, which allows for the direct cutting of 2D materials using a heated scanning nanotip. Arbitrarily shaped cuts with a resolution of 20 nm are obtained in monolayer 2D materials, i.e., molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2), molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), and molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2), by thermomechanically cleaving the chemical bonds and by rapid sublimation of the polymer layer underneath the 2D material layer. Several micro/nanoribbon structures are fabricated and electrically characterized to demonstrate the process for device fabrication. The proposed direct nanocutting technique allows for precisely tailoring nanostructures of 2D materials with foreseen applications in the fabrication of electronic and photonic nanodevices.

      <title>Boosting Catalysis of Pd Nanoparticles in MOFs by Pore Wall Engineering: The Roles of Electron Transfer and Adsorption Energy</title>
      <dc:description>
Pd nanoparticles (NPs) encapsulated into UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = H, OMe, NH2, 2OH, 2OH(Hf)) show drastically different activities toward the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. This work highlights the influence of the surface microenvironment of guest metal NPs, the catalytic activity of which is dominated by electron transfer and the adsorption energy, via the systematic modification of host metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs).








Abstract
The chemical environment of metal nanoparticles (NPs) possesses significant influence on their catalytic performance yet is far from being well understood. Herein, tiny Pd NPs are encapsulated into the pore space of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = H, OMe, NH2, 2OH, 2OH(Hf)), affording Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X composites. The surface microenvironment of the Pd NPs is readily modulated by pore wall engineering, via the functional group and metal substitution in the MOFs. Consequently, the catalytic activity of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X follows the order of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;2OH(Hf) &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OMe &gt; Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H toward the hydrogenation of benzoic acid. It is found that the activity difference is not only ascribed to the distinct charge transfer between Pd and the MOF, but is also explained by the discriminated substrate adsorption energy of Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (&#8211;OH &lt; &#8211;2OH(Hf) &lt; &#8211;NH2 &lt; &#8211;OMe &lt; &#8211;H), based on CO&#8208;diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectra and density&#8208;functional theory (DFT) calculations. The Pd@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;OH, featuring a high Pd electronic state and moderate adsorption energy, displays the highest activity. This work highlights the influence of the surface microenvironment of guest metal NPs, the catalytic activity of which is dominated by electron transfer and the adsorption energy, via the systematic substitution of metal and functional groups in host MOFs.

      <title>Chirality of Liquid Crystals Formed from Achiral Molecules Revealed by Resonant X&#8208;Ray Scattering</title>
      <dc:description>
Chirality in liquid crystalline systems is reviewed, with special emphasis on advanced examination techniques that enable unmasking of the internal structure and morphology of novel mesophases. Particular emphasis is placed on the benefits of resonant X&#8208;ray techniques. The application potential of chiral liquid crystals in nanocomposites is provided.








Abstract
Intensive research on chiral liquid crystals (LCs) has been fueled by their actively tunable physicochemical properties and structural complexity, comparable to those of sophisticated natural materials. Herein, recent progress in the discovery of new classes of chiral LCs, enabled by a combination of nano&#8208; and macroscale investigations is reviewed. First, an overview is provided of liquid crystalline phases, made of chiral and achiral low&#8208;weight molecules, that exhibit chiral structure and/or chiral morphology. Then, recent progress in the discovery of new classes of chiral LCs, particularly enabled by the application of resonant X&#8208;ray scattering is described. It is shown that the method is sensitive to modulations of molecular orientation and therefore provides information hardly accessible by means of other techniques, such as the sense of helical structures or chirality transfer across length scales. Finally, a perspective is presented on the future scope, opportunities, and challenges in the field of chiral LCs, in particular related to nanocomposites.

      <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Perovskite Quantum Dot Hybrid Nonfullerene Organic Solar Cells with Near&#8208;Zero Driving Force</title>
      <dc:description>
CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) hybrid nonfullerene organic solar cells are fabricated. The devices based on a PTB7&#8208;Th:FOIC blend with PQDs yield higher efficiency of 13.2% even at near&#8208;zero driving force than that without PQDs (11.6%). Incorporation of PQDs also leads to efficiency enhancement from 15.4% to 16.6% for a PM6:Y6 blend.








Abstract
To take advantages of the intense absorption and fluorescence, high charge mobility, and high dielectric constant of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), PQD hybrid nonfullerene organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated. Addition of PQDs leads to simultaneous enhancement of open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC), and fill factor (FF); power conversion efficiencies are boosted from 11.6% to 13.2% for PTB7&#8208;Th:FOIC blend and from 15.4% to 16.6% for PM6:Y6 blend. Incorporation of PQDs dramatically increases the energy of the charge transfer state, resulting in near&#8208;zero driving force and improved VOC. Interestingly, at near&#8208;zero driving force, the PQD hybrid OSCs show more efficient charge generation than the control device without PQDs, contributing to enhanced JSC, due to the formation of cascade band structure and increased molecular ordering. The strong fluorescence of the PQDs enhances the external quantum efficiency of the electroluminescence of the active layer, which can reduce nonradiative recombination voltage loss. The high dielectric constant of the PQDs screens the Coulombic interactions and reduces charge recombination, which is beneficial for increased FF. This work may open up wide applicability of perovskite quantum dots and an avenue toward high&#8208;performance nonfullerene solar cells.

      <title>Synthesis of Ionic Ultramicroporous Polymers for Selective Separation of Acetylene from Ethylene</title>
      <dc:description>
Ionic ultramicroporous polymers featuring high&#8208;density inorganic anions and narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity are reported and used for highly selective separation of acetylene from ethylene. A covalent and ionic dual&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to engineer the ultramicroporosity and functionality of amorphous polymers. Record&#8208;high selectivity (286.1&#8211;474.4) for acetylene over ethylene is realized, along with excellent thermal and water stability.








Abstract
The design of highly stable and efficient porous materials is essential for developing breakthrough hydrocarbon separation methods based on physisorption to replace currently used energy&#8208;intensive distillation/absorption technologies. Efforts to develop advanced porous materials such as zeolites, coordination frameworks, and organic polymers have met with limited success. Here, a new class of ionic ultramicroporous polymers (IUPs) with high&#8208;density inorganic anions and narrowly distributed ultramicroporosity is reported, which are synthesized by a facile free&#8208;radical polymerization using branched and amphiphilic ionic compounds as reactive monomers. A covalent and ionic dual&#8208;crosslinking strategy is proposed to manipulate the pore structure of amorphous polymers at the ultramicroporous scale. The IUPs exhibit exceptional selectivity (286.1&#8211;474.4) for separating acetylene from ethylene along with high thermal and water stability, collaboratively demonstrated by gas adsorption isotherms and experimental breakthrough curves. Modeling studies unveil the specific binding sites for acetylene capture as well as the interconnected ultramicroporosity for size sieving. The porosity&#8208;engineering protocol used in this work can also be extended to the design of other ultramicroporous materials for the challenging separation of other key gas constituents.

      <title>Observation of Electrically Tunable van Hove Singularities in Twisted Bilayer Graphene from NanoARPES</title>
      <dc:description>
An electrostatically gated van der Waals heterostructure composed of twisted bilayer graphene is investigated using nanoscale angle&#8208;resolved photoemission during device operation. The dispersion of the superlattice bands and the energy of the associated van Hove singularities are tuned by varying the charge carrier density in the two twisted graphene layers using the back&#8208;gate voltage.








Abstract
The possibility of triggering correlated phenomena by placing a singularity of the density of states near the Fermi energy remains an intriguing avenue toward engineering the properties of quantum materials. Twisted bilayer graphene is a key material in this regard because the superlattice produced by the rotated graphene layers introduces a van Hove singularity and flat bands near the Fermi energy that cause the emergence of numerous correlated phases, including superconductivity. Direct demonstration of electrostatic control of the superlattice bands over a wide energy range has, so far, been critically missing. This work examines the effect of electrical doping on the electronic band structure of twisted bilayer graphene using a back&#8208;gated device architecture for angle&#8208;resolved photoemission measurements with a nano&#8208;focused light spot. A twist angle of 12.2&#176; is selected such that the superlattice Brillouin zone is sufficiently large to enable identification of van Hove singularities and flat band segments in momentum space. The doping dependence of these features is extracted over an energy range of 0.4 eV, expanding the combinations of twist angle and doping where they can be placed at the Fermi energy and thereby induce new correlated electronic phases in twisted bilayer graphene.

      <title>Epitaxially Strained CeO2/Mn3O4 Nanocrystals as an Enhanced Antioxidant for Radioprotection</title>
      <dc:description>
Inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that is powerful enough to protect intestinal stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced reactive oxygen species damage. Only a small dose of the CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome in a human intestinal organoid model and increased survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.








Abstract
Nanomaterials with antioxidant properties are promising for treating reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;related diseases. However, maintaining efficacy at low doses to minimize toxicity is a critical for clinical applications. Tuning the surface strain of metallic nanoparticles can enhance catalytic reactivity, which has rarely been demonstrated in metal oxide nanomaterials. Here, it is shown that inducing surface strains of CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals produces highly catalytic antioxidants that can protect tissue&#8208;resident stem cells from irradiation&#8208;induced ROS damage. Manganese ions deposited on the surface of cerium oxide (CeO2) nanocrystals form strained layers of manganese oxide (Mn3O4) islands, increasing the number of oxygen vacancies. CeO2/Mn3O4 nanocrystals show better catalytic activity than CeO2 or Mn3O4 alone and can protect the regenerative capabilities of intestinal stem cells in an organoid model after a lethal dose of irradiation. A small amount of the nanocrystals prevents acute radiation syndrome and increases the survival rate of mice treated with a lethal dose of total body irradiation.

      <dc:description>
A flexible photodetector based on ultrathin graphdiyne nanosheets is constructed and applied in a three&#8208;electrode photoelectrochemical (PEC)&#8208;type system to study its photoresponse behaviors. As described by Xiuwen Zhang, Jialiang Xu, Han Zhang, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001082, the prepared PDs show excellent photoresponse after bending or twisting for 1000 cycles. Moreover, the PDs exhibit pronounced long&#8208;term stability after being kept in an alkaline electrolyte for more than 1 month.

      <title>Flat Lenses Based on 2D Perovskite Nanosheets</title>
      <dc:description>
Flat lenses based on 2D perovskite nanosheets with a subwavelength focusing capability (&#8776;0.5&#955;) are reported, which are fabricated by using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. Halide elemental substitution could further reveal potential tunable focus capability (0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;).








Abstract
Ultrathin flat lenses based on metasurfaces or metamaterials have shown great promise in recent years as essential components in nano&#8208;optical system, with capability of abrupt changes of light wavefronts. However, such structural designs require complex nanopatterns and a time&#8208;consuming nanofabrication process. In this regard, flat lenses are developed based on 2D perovskite nanosheets, using a cost&#8208;effective mask&#8208;free femtosecond direct laser writing system. The optical properties of the 2D perovskite are rationally adjusted through facile composition engineering as well as thickness&#8208;dependent quantum&#8208;size confinement. A diffraction theory model is derived to understand the focusing mechanism of the 2D perovskite nanosheets flat lenses. The as&#8208;fabricated lenses exploit the tunable material property variations to effectively manipulate not only the amplitude but also the phase of the incident light to focus into a 3D focal spot with a sub&#8208;wavelength resolution in the range of 0.5&#8211;0.9&#955;. The results pave the way toward low&#8208;cost and large&#8208;scale high&#8208;resolution imaging applications in the future.

      <title>External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 24% with CIEy Value of 0.08 using a Novel Carbene&#8208;Based Iridium Complex in Deep&#8208;Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
      <dc:description>
A high external quantum efficiency for deep&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is developed using a novel carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex, which enhances the carrier balance in the emission layer. A high quantum efficiency of 24% with a deep&#8208;blue CIE(x, y) coordinate of (0.149, 0.085) is achieved, which satisfies the stringent National Television System Committee (NTSC) requirements with high efficiency.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue triplet emitters remain far inferior to standard red and green triplet emitters in terms of exhibiting high&#8208;color&#8208;purity Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) y values of &#8804;0.1, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and high electroluminescent brightnesses in phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In fact, no deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter with color purity and high device performance has previously been reported. In this study, a deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter, mer&#8208;tris(N&#8208;phenyl, N&#8208;benzyl&#8208;pyridoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)iridium(III) (mer&#8208;Ir1) is developed, which meets the requirements of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.149, 0.085) with an extremely high EQE of 24.8% and maximum brightness (Lmax) of 6453 cd m&#8722;2, by a device with a 40 vol% doping ratio. Moreover, another device demonstrates an EQEmax of 21.3%, an Lmax of 5247 cd m&#8722;2, and CIE(x, y) coordinates of (0.151, 0.086) at a 30 vol% doping ratio. This is the first report of a high&#8208;performance, deep&#8208;blue phosphor, carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex device with outstanding CIE(x, y) color coordinates and a high EQE. The results of this study indicate that the novel dopant mer&#8208;Ir1 is a promising candidate for reducing power consumption in display applications.

     alt="External Quantum Efficiency Exceeding 24% with CIEy Value of 0.08 using a Novel Carbene&#8208;Based Iridium Complex in Deep&#8208;Blue Phosphorescent Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A high external quantum efficiency for deep&#8208;blue&#8208;emitting organic light&#8208;emitting diodes is developed using a novel carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex, which enhances the carrier balance in the emission layer. A high quantum efficiency of 24% with a deep&#8208;blue CIE(&lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y &lt;/i&gt;) coordinate of (0.149, 0.085) is achieved, which satisfies the stringent National Television System Committee (NTSC) requirements with high efficiency.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Deep&#8208;blue triplet emitters remain far inferior to standard red and green triplet emitters in terms of exhibiting high&#8208;color&#8208;purity Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) &lt;i&gt;y &lt;/i&gt; values of &#8804;0.1, external quantum efficiencies (EQEs), and high electroluminescent brightnesses in phosphorescent organic light&#8208;emitting diodes. In fact, no deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter with color purity and high device performance has previously been reported. In this study, a deep&#8208;blue triplet emitter, &lt;i&gt;mer &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;tris(&lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;phenyl, &lt;i&gt;N &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;benzyl&#8208;pyridoimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)iridium(III) (&lt;i&gt;mer &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Ir1) is developed, which meets the requirements of the National Television System Committee (NTSC) CIE(&lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y &lt;/i&gt;) coordinates of (0.149, 0.085) with an extremely high EQE of 24.8% and maximum brightness (&lt;i&gt;L &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt;) of 6453 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, by a device with a 40 vol% doping ratio. Moreover, another device demonstrates an EQE&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 21.3%, an &lt;i&gt;L &lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; of 5247 cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and CIE(&lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y &lt;/i&gt;) coordinates of (0.151, 0.086) at a 30 vol% doping ratio. This is the first report of a high&#8208;performance, deep&#8208;blue phosphor, carbene&#8208;based Ir(III) complex device with outstanding CIE(&lt;i&gt;x &lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;y &lt;/i&gt;) color coordinates and a high EQE. The results of this study indicate that the novel dopant &lt;i&gt;mer &lt;/i&gt;&#8208;Ir1 is a promising candidate for reducing power consumption in display applications.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Biradical&#8208;Featured Stable Organic&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Photothermal Materials for Highly Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Water Evaporation</title>
      <dc:description>
A stable croconium derivative, &#8220;CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T&#8221;, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay, enabling a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% under one sun irradiation.








Abstract
With recent progress in photothermal materials, organic small molecules featured with flexibility, diverse structures, and tunable properties exhibit unique advantages but have been rarely applied in solar&#8208;driven water evaporation owing to limited sunlight absorption resulting in low solar&#8211;thermal conversion. Herein, a stable croconium derivative, named CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T, is designed to exhibit the unique biradical property and strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking in the solid state, which facilitate not only a broad absorption spectrum from 300 to 1600 nm for effective sunlight harvesting, but also highly efficient photothermal conversion by boosting nonradiative decay. The photothermal efficiency is evaluated to be 72.7% under 808 nm laser irradiation. Based on this, an interfacial&#8208;heating evaporation system based on CR&#8208;TPE&#8208;T is established successfully, using which a high solar&#8208;energy&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency of 87.2% and water evaporation rate of 1.272 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1 sun irradiation are obtained, thus making an important step toward the application of organic&#8208;small&#8208;molecule photothermal materials in solar energy utilization.

      <title>Photonic Multishells Composed of Cholesteric Liquid Crystals Designed by Controlled Phase Separation in Emulsion Drops</title>
      <dc:description>
Photonic multishells are created by controlled phase separation of cholesteric liquid crystals and hydrophilic liquid confined in emulsion drops. The material exchange between the dispersed and continuous phases triggers the consecutive steps of phase separation, through which onion&#8208;like drops are formed. Multiple photonic stopbands are spontaneously developed by uneven partitioning of the chiral dopant, which provides advanced photonic functionality.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs), also known as chiral nematic LCs, show a photonic stopband, which is promising for various optical applications. In particular, CLCs confined in microcompartments are useful for sensing, lasing, and optical barcoding at the microscale. The integration of distinct CLCs into single microstructures can provide advanced functionality. In this work, CLC multishells with multiple stopbands are created by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a simple yet highly controlled manner. A homogeneous ternary mixture of LC, hydrophilic liquid, and co&#8208;solvent is microfluidically emulsified to form uniform oil&#8208;in&#8208;water drops, which undergo LLPS to form onion&#8208;like drops composed of alternating CLC&#8208;rich and CLC&#8208;depleted layers. The multiplicity is controlled from one to five by adjusting the initial composition of the ternary mixture, which dictates the number of consecutive steps of LLPS. Interestingly, the concentration of the chiral dopant becomes reduced from the outermost to the innermost CLC drop due to uneven partitioning during LLPS, which results in multiple stopbands. Therefore, the photonic multishells show multiple structural colors. In addition, dye&#8208;doped multishells provide band&#8208;edge lasing at two different wavelengths. This new class of photonic multishells will provide new opportunities for advanced optical applications.

      <title>High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells Enabled by n&#8208;Type Polymers with an Ultranarrow Bandgap Down to 1.28 eV</title>
      <dc:description>
n&#8208;Type polymer semiconductors with a broad absorption and ultranarrow bandgap down to 1.28 eV are synthesized. When applied as electron acceptor materials, a power conversion efficiency of over 10% with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm is realized for all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract
Compared to organic solar cells based on narrow&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) lags much behind due to the lack of high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers, which should have low&#8208;aligned frontier molecular orbital levels and narrow bandgap with broad and intense absorption extended to the near&#8208;infrared region. Herein, two novel polymer acceptors, DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC, are synthesized with ultranarrow bandgaps (ultra&#8208;NBG) of 1.38 and 1.28 eV, respectively. When applied in transistors, both polymers show efficient charge transport with a highest electron mobility of 1.72 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 obtained for DCNBT&#8208;TPC. Blended with a polymer donor, PBDTTT&#8208;E&#8208;T, the resultant all&#8208;PSCs based on DCNBT&#8208;TPC and DCNBT&#8208;TPIC achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 9.26% and 10.22% with short&#8208;circuit currents up to 19.44 and 22.52 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. This is the first example that a PCE of over 10% can be achieved using ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors with a photoresponse reaching 950 nm in all&#8208;PSCs. These results demonstrate that ultra&#8208;NBG polymer acceptors, in line with nonfullerene small&#8208;molecule acceptors, are also available as a highly promising class of electron acceptors for maximizing device performance in all&#8208;PSCs.

      <dc:description>
Novel thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size of &lt;4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions, as discussed by Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001132. The membranes potentially lower the energy burden and improve the environmental sustainability of chemical separations, which are currently based on thermal principles and account for approximately 10&#8211;15% of the world's total energy consumption.

     alt="Chemical Separation: Finely Tuned Submicroporous Thin&#8208;Film Molecular Sieve Membranes for Highly Efficient Fluid Separations (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Novel thin&#8208;film composite membranes containing entrapped structural submicroporosity (pore size of &amp;lt;4 &#197;) exhibit superb performance for removal of small solutes from aqueous or organic solutions, as discussed by Ingo Pinnau and co&#8208;workers in article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020011322001132&lt;/a&gt;. The membranes potentially lower the energy burden and improve the environmental sustainability of chemical separations, which are currently based on thermal principles and account for approximately 10&#8211;15% of the world's total energy consumption.

      <dc:description>
Optical activity of surface lattice resonances is demonstrated by Nicolas Vogel and co&#8208;workers in article number 2001330. The controlled arrangement of chiral crescent&#8208;shaped nanoantennae allows a selective response of the surface lattice resonances to the handedness of incident circularly polarized light. Modified colloidal lithtography enables the fabrication of cm2&#8208;scale substrates using a self&#8208;assembled poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide)&#8211;silica core&#8211;shell system as particle masks.

      <title>Cancer Therapy: Harnessing the Formation of Natural Killer&#8211;Tumor Cell Immunological Synapses for Enhanced Therapeutic Effect in Solid Tumors (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
In article number 2000020, Won Jong Kim and co&#8208;workers describe a reinforced natural killer (ReNK) system, adopting the formation of NK&#8211;tumor cell immunological synapses (IS) as a trigger for delivery of tumor&#8208;specific chemotherapeutics. NK cells are decorated with the IS environment&#8208;responsive micellar system to ensure the release of drug when they attack cancer cells. The strategy enables the NK cells to inhibit the growth of solid tumors by efficient penetration of the delivered drug into the tumor tissue; otherwise, its penetration is hindered by the dense extracellular matrix of the tumor tissue.

      <title>Magnetic Patterning: Local Photothermal Control of Phase Transitions for On&#8208;Demand Room&#8208;Temperature Rewritable Magnetic Patterning (Adv. Mater. 22/2020)</title>
      <dc:description>
Patterned magnetic nanostructures are foundational to magnetic memory and logic devices. In article number 2001080, Antonio B. Mei, Gregory D. Fuchs, and co&#8208;workers design a platform for reconfigurable magnetic nanostructures in FeRh by tuning the transition temperature from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic such that both phases are stable at room temperature. Focused laser heating is used to write ferromagnetic patterns of arbitrary shape at ultrafast speeds, which can be erased by cooling below room temperature.
