         <title>Response to Comment on &#8220;Non&#8208;Polaritonic Effects in Cavity&#8208;Modified Photochemistry&#8221;: On the Importance of Experimental Details</title>

Abstract
This note responds to Schwartz and Hutchison's Comment. Differences appear to have arisen not in the experimental results themselves but in their interpretation: more extensive experiments allow one to distinguish between &#8220;true positive&#8221; and &#8220;false positive&#8221; results. Potential evidence of non&#8208;polaritonic effects in Schwartz and Hutchison's own work is identified. It is hoped that this work will encourage others to produce more systematic investigations of strong coupling.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Out&#8208;Of&#8208;Plane Ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 Heterophase Bilayer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is observed in 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD). The phenomenon is confirmed through structural analysis using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG), as well as switching behavior characterized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) and ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) measurements. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the ferroelectricity originates from interlayer sliding. This discovery extends the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to vertically stacked heterophase systems, offering new opportunities for exploring coupled phenomena in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs).








Abstract
The emergence of heterophase 2D materials, distinguished by their unique structures, has led to the discovery of a multitude of intriguing physical properties and a broad range of potential applications. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity is uncovered in a heterophase structure of 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2, which is synthesized via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) by tuning the formation energies for MoS2 with varied phases. The atomically resolved structures of the obtained 1T&#8242;/1H MoS2 bilayers are captured using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and are confirmed to be non&#8208;centrosymmetric using second&#8208;harmonic generation (SHG) characterizations. The intrinsic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization is visualized by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM), which reveals that ferroelectric domains can be manipulated under an applied electric field. Ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) devices fabricated on these bilayers exhibit reversible switching between a high resistance state (HRS) and a low resistance state (LRS). Density functional theory (DFT) calculations elucidate that the intrinsic ferroelectricity in 1T&#8242;/1H bilayers is attributed to interlayer sliding and lattice mismatch. The findings not only expand the scope of 2D ferroelectrics to include vertically stacked heterophase bilayers but also open avenues for exploring the coupling effect between ferroelectricity and other phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity, and photocatalysis in 2D heterophase TMDCs.

         <title>Photoinduced, Swift, and Reversible Spatiotemporal Programming of Double Dynamically Bonded Liquid Crystal Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating anthracene&#8208;based dynamic bonds into a supramolecular liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) enables swift and reversible alternation of its local nematic&#8208;isotropic transition temperature and global actuation strain. The morphing behavior of the LCE actuator can be spatiotemporally programmed by varying the local UV exposure. This empowers precise motion control to accomplish intricate tasks, such as the aligning, threading, and locking mechanism.








Abstract
Spatiotemporal programming of the morphing behavior of liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) by local tailoring of the nematic to isotropic temperature (TNI) can empower the precise design of their versatile motions. The current approach and materials design to achieve this process are either slow or irreversible, limiting its efficiency and efficacy. Here, a dynamic bond of anthracene and ethyl acrylate (An&#8208;A) is introduced to enable photoinduced topology transformation to alter the TNI of the LCE, into a hydrogen&#8208;bonded supramolecular LCE network, where the actuation modes can already be reconfigured upon annealing. Experiments and molecular dynamics simulation demonstrate that the An&#8208;A bonds undergo reversible cycloaddition with 365&#160;nm UV exposure for as short as 10&#160;min, and depolymerization with 254&#160;nm UV. The resulting topological transformations of the network give rise to changes in the TNI, actuation strain, and mechanical properties, which can be programed and erased by light. With that, a spatiotemporally reprogrammable LCE actuator: a single LCE that morphs into different shapes, especially those that are far more achievable when the trajectory can be designed by sequential actuation, is developed. This system offers a promising strategy for swift and reversible morphing behavior with custom&#8208;designed trajectory in future smart soft robots.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Recyclable Polyester Elastomers Through Transient Strain&#8208;Stiffening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transient strain&#8208;crystallization simultaneously strengthens and toughens block polyester elastomers while conserving recyclability. Using controlled polymerization catalysis and commercial monomers, block polyester elastomers outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space.








Abstract
Polyester thermoplastic elastomers are promising sustainable materials but their mechanical properties need improvement, in particular, attempts to increase strength often result in compromised elasticity. Strong and tough elastomers are known but require complex polymer formulations together with control over cross&#8208;linking or crystallinity, both of which challenge recycling. Here, the introduction of transient strain&#8208;stiffening approaches into fully amorphous structures show both strengthening and toughening of elastomers while conserving recyclability. The new amorphous block polyester elastomers are prepared by controlled polymerization methods using commercial monomers. The block polymers comprise a central poly(&#603;&#8208;caprolactone&#8208;co&#8208;&#603;&#8208;decalactone) block flanked by poly(cyclohexene oxide&#8208;alt&#8208;phthalate) blocks. Elastomer thermomechanical properties are tuned by varying ratios of &#603;&#8208;caprolactone to &#603;&#8208;decalactone within the mid&#8208;block to access materials with excellent mechanical properties. The best elastomers feature 30&#8211;50 wt.% polycaprolactone and exhibit tensile strengths up to 40&#160;MPa, elongations at break above 2000%, with excellent elastic recovery (&gt;90%). These materials exhibit strain&#8208;induced crystallization and outperform current commercial elastomers, entering a new region of tensile mechanical property space. They have service temperature ranges from &#8722;60 to 140&#160;&#176;C and high temperature stability (&#8805;300&#160;&#176;C), with wide thermal (re)processing windows. These new polyester elastomers also show high resistance to creep, humidity resistance, and excellent recyclability.

         <title>A Sprayable Hydrogel Based on Biomimetic Polypeptide&#8208;Modified Lipid Nanoparticles for Treating Non&#8208;Compressible Hemorrhaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca2&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca2&#8314;&#8208;sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.








Abstract
Non&#8208;compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticle&#8208;based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2&#8208;distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphoethanolamine&#8208;N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE&#8208;PEG2000&#8208;COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PAP and DSPE&#8208;PEG&#8208;PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl&#8208;sn&#8208;glycero&#8208;3&#8208;phospho&#8208;L&#8208;serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide&#8208;modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl2&#8208;sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca2+ amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network.

&lt;p&gt;This study develops a sprayable hydrogel based on polypeptide-modified lipid nanoparticles (PLNs) mimicking natural hemostasis. PLNs integrate platelet adhesion peptide (GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (GGQQLK), DSPS, and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314; to activate coagulation. Combined with Ca&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#8314;-sodium alginate hydrogels, they synergistically enhance rapid clot formation via platelet aggregation, prothrombin activation, and fibrin crosslinking, offering an efficient biomimetic strategy for hemorrhage.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-compressible hemorrhaging is the main cause of death in modern warfare. A biomimetic peptide-modified lipid nanoparticle-based sprayable hydrogel is developed to mimic and amplify the blood coagulation process for effective hemostasis. A platelet adhesion peptide (PAP, sequence: GFOGER) and platelet crosslinking peptide (PCP, sequence: GGQQLK) are customized and conjugated to 1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[methoxy (polyethylene glycol) 2000] acid (DSPE-PEG2000-COOH) via amido bonds to form DSPE-PEG-PAP and DSPE-PEG-PCP, respectively. These compounds are mixed with distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine, cholesterol, and distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-L-serine (DSPS) to construct the peptide-modified lipid nanoparticles via thin film rehydration. The nanoparticles are incorporated into a CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-sodium alginate sprayable hydrogel crosslinked via ionic bonds. The application of the hydrogel solution quickly gels and seals the wound. The PAP activates and adheres platelets, the DSPS and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; amplify prothrombin activation, and PCP strengthens the fibrin network. The hydrogel achieves rapid hemostasis within 30 s in a liver hemorrhage model. This sprayable hydrogel has significant potential for managing non-compressible hemorrhaging.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electron Extraction Optimization for Carbon&#8208;Based Hole&#8208;Conductor&#8208;Free Perovskite Photovoltaics With Record 1.41&#160;V VOC</title>

         <dc:description>
A gradient electron energy level strategy is constructed to reduce voltage losses in planar HTL&#8208;free CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs. This electron extraction optimization enables rapid photogenerated electron extraction and carrier separation, thereby suppressing recombination at the back contact. The resulting PSCs deliver a record VOC of 1.41 V, a high PCE of 17.42% and a high stability, simultaneously.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based CsPbI2Br perovskite solar cells (PSCs) free of a hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) have emerged as promising photovoltaics due to their low processing cost and superior stability. However, the voltage deficit resulting from inefficient carrier extraction causes insufficient power conversion efficiency (PCE), severely hindering their progress. Here, a gradient electron energy level modulation strategy proves effective in reducing voltage losses through the rapid extraction of photogenerated electrons. This process enhances carrier separation/collection and reduces recombination at the back contact, thereby achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics. It is demonstrated that the front electron extraction, equally critical as the prevailing back perovskite/carbon contact, accounts for the significant contributing factor of voltage deficit in carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free PSCs. The resulting PSCs deliver a record open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.41&#160;V and a PCE of 17.42% and retain more than 92% of their initial efficiency after 1, 000&#160;h. These results highlight the significant potential of carbon&#8208;based HTL&#8208;free perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Nacre&#8208;Inspired 2D Carbon&#8208;Based Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes recent advancements in nacre&#8208;inspired 2D carbon&#8208;based nanocomposites (TDCNs) based&#8208;graphene and MXene. Innovative fabrication strategies have been developed to align nanosheets while effectively eliminating voids through interfacial bridging, synergistic toughening, and confined assembly. The resulting densified TDCNs demonstrate exceptional fatigue resistance, electrical conductivity, and durability, making them suitable for applications in flexible electronics, bone tissue regeneration, and thermal insulation.








Abstract
Nacre has become the golden standard for the structural design of high&#8208;performance composites due to extraordinary fracture toughness, which exceeds the mixing principle of traditional composites by two orders of magnitude. Surprisingly, the unique biomaterials are formed under ambient temperature and pressure conditions, resulting in low energy consumption and no pollution. It is an effective approach to obtain inspiration from structure&#8208;activity relationships of biomaterials for developing the next&#8208;generation of high&#8208;performance composites. Furthermore, 2D carbon nanomaterials, such as graphene and MXene, having exceptional mechanical and electrical properties, are ideal candidates for fabricating new generation high&#8208;performance composites that would replace carbon fiber (CF) composites. This review systematically summarizes relevant works for high&#8208;performance 2D carbon nanocomposites (TDCNs) inspired by nacre. The review first explores structural insights from the nacre. Next, the fabrication strategies of TDCNs are systematically summarized, with an emphasis on achieving highly aligned 2D carbon nanosheets through advanced assembly techniques. Subsequently, the critical role of void defects, which is a key factor governing the mechanical properties of TDCNs, is addressed by analyzing their formation mechanisms, characterization methodologies, and elimination strategies. Finally, the applications and challenges of high&#8208;performance TDCNs obtained through highly aligned assembly and densification processes are discussed.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

         <title>Pairing N&#8208;Vacancy and Adjacent Ni&#8208;Sites in the Local Microenvironment to Regulate the Urea Oxidation Reaction Pathway With Enhanced Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In nitrogen vacancies&#8208;rich nickel nitride (Ni3N&#8208;VN), a local microenvironment of nitrogen vacancies and adjacent Ni sites is formed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites can be converted to NiOOH at a lower potential, and urea adsorption on the electron&#8208;deficient nitrogen vacancy region is conducive to its partial dissociation, conceiving to efficient urea oxidation reaction.








Abstract
The urea oxidation reaction (UOR) is a promising approach for replacing the oxygen evolution reaction in hydrogen production, offering lower energy consumption. However, the kinetics of Ni&#8208;based catalysts for UOR are hindered by the high formation potential of NiOOH and its repeated transition with Ni(OH)2. In this study, a local microenvironment featuring electron&#8208;deficient N&#8208;vacancies (VN) paired with adjacent electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites on Ni3N (Ni3N&#8208;VN) to enhance UOR kinetics is constructed. The electron&#8208;rich Ni&#8208;sites significantly reduce the energy barrier for NiOOH formation and promote the conversion of Ni(OH)2 to NiOOH. Meanwhile, the VN sites induce low charge transfer resistance in Ni3N, facilitating efficient electron transfer and boosting UOR performance while ensuring the stability of the active NiOOH phase. The VN sites promote the adsorption of the urea N atom at the active site, favoring the reaction pathway toward &#8220;NCO&#8315;&#8221; formation without requiring complete urea dissociation. This pathway alleviates the NiOOH/Ni(OH)2 conversion cycle, lowers charge transfer resistance, and improves reaction kinetics. Ni3N&#8208;VN demonstrates excellent UOR activity (low potential of 1.46&#160;V at 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and industrial prospects (integrating into an anion exchange membrane flow electrolyzer with 20% Pt/C, producing 600&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.84&#160;V), highlighting its potential for practical applications.

         <title>Direct Recycling of Spent LiFePO4 Cathodes Through Photocatalytic Correction of Anti&#8208;Site Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We employ photocatalysis to decrease the iron migration barrier, enabling the repositioning of disordered iron atoms into their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously facilitating Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thereby realizing the direct recovery of S&#8208;LFP. This method has substantial environmental and economic benefits, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;Li (FeLi) anti&#8208;site defects, commonly observed in degraded LiFePO4 cathodes, impede Li+ mobility and disrupt the electronic pathways, leading to significant performance degradation in LFP. However, addressing FeLi anti&#8208;site defects to achieve direct recycling of LFP remains challenging due to Fe high migration energy barriers and the lattice distortions they induce. Here, a feasible strategy is proposed for LFP regeneration by utilizing photocatalysis to reduce the Fe migration barrier. This approach facilitates repositioning disordered Fe atoms to their designated octahedral sites while simultaneously enabling Li+ diffusion into the LFP lattice, thus restoring capacity and ensuring cycling stability. The mechanism of the photocatalysis regeneration strategy is comprehensively analyzed through a combination of theoretical calculations, in&#8208;depth atomic characterization techniques, and electrochemical evaluations. Notably, this strategy is adaptable to varying levels of FeLi anti&#8208;site defects in spent LFP. Furthermore, life cycle analysis highlights the substantial environmental and economic benefits of this advanced strategy, making it a promising solution for sustainable lithium&#8208;ion battery recycling.

Flexible QZPCs formulated by the MES@CNT/CC air cathode and IL&#8208;PANa hydrogel electrolyte demonstrate a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105 Wh kgcell&#8722;1, and an ultra&#8208;long cycle life of 4000 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even at low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C. The electronic synergy within the bifunctional MES@CNT/CC air cathode, initiates an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;site&#8208;switching catalytic mechanism during the reciprocating ORR and OER processes, thereby sustaining the high performance of the QZPCs.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air pouch cells (QZPCs) promise a high energy&#8208;to&#8208;cost ratio while ensuring inherent safety. However, addressing the challenges associated with exploring superior energy&#8208;wise cathode catalysts along with their activity origin, and the super&#8208;ionic electrolytes remains a fundamental task. Herein, the realistic high&#8208;performance QZPCs are contrived, underpinned by a robust NiVFeCo medium&#8208;entropy metal sulfides (MESs) bifunctional air cathode with a record&#8208;low potential polarization of 0.523&#160;V, paired with a sodium polyacrylate&#8208;ionic liquid hydrogel exhibiting exceptional conductivity (234 mS cm&#8722;1) and water retention (93.8% at 7 days) at room temperature as the super&#8208;ionic conductor electrolyte. Through combined studies of in situ Raman, ex situ X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure analysis, and theoretic calculations, an intriguing adaptive active&#8208;sites&#8208;switching mechanism of the MESs cathode during discharging/charging processes is unveiled, revealing a dynamic role transition of Co and Ni active sites in the reversible oxygen electrocatalysis. Consequently, the persistent low cathode polarization and super ion&#8208;conductive electrolyte endorse QZPCs an excellent rate performance from 1 to 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at room temperature. Moreover, an impressively high cell&#8208;level energy density of 105&#160;Wh kgcell&#8722;1 with an ultra&#8208;long cycle lifespan of 4000 cycles at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a low temperature of &#8722;30&#160;&#176;C is achieved.

         <title>Bioinspired O2&#8208;Evolution Catalysts with Proton&#8208;Coupled Electron Transfer Pathway for Portable Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide (Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x) is developed as an O2&#8208;evolution catalyst with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for efficient and low&#8208;energy O2 generation. The lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x optimizes Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thereby enhancing O2 production performance. This technique ensures an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability, providing significant societal benefits.









Abstract
Producing high&#8208;purity oxygen (O2) has a wide range of applications across diverse sectors, such as medicine, tunnel construction, the chemical industry, and fermentation. However, current O2 production methods are burdened by complexity, heavy equipment, high energy consumption, and limited adaptability to harsh environments. Here, to address this grand challenge, the de novo design of Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxide is proposed to serve as bioinspired O2&#8208;evolution catalysts with proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) pathway for low&#8208;energy, environmentally friendly, cost&#8208;effective, and portable O2 generation. The comprehensive studies confirm that the lattice H species in Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;based O2&#8208;evolution catalyst can trigger a PCET pathway to optimize Ru&#8208;oxygen intermediates interactions, thus ultimately reducing reaction energy barriers and improving the activities and durabilities. Consequently, the prepared Ru&#8208;Co(OH)x&#8208;loaded membrane catalysts exhibit rapid and long&#8208;term stable O2 production capabilities. Furthermore, the proposed material design strategy of lattice H&#8208;species shows remarkable universality and adaptability to broad Ru&#8208;doped metal hydroxides. This efficient, portable, and cost&#8208;effective O2 generation technique is suggested to ensure an uninterrupted O2 supply during emergencies and in regions with limited O2 availability or air pollution, thus offering significant societal benefits in broad applications.

         <title>Suppression of Stacking Faults for Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors show that the (011)C perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium&#8208;rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.









Abstract
The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)&#8208;faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in&#8208;and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in&#8208;depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high&#8208;quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade&#8208;coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU&#8208;treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm2, retained &gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm2 ETU&#8208;treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1&#8208;sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions. Our demonstration of scalable and stable perovskite solar cells represents a promising step towards achieving a reliable perovskite PV technology.

&lt;p&gt;The authors show that the (011)&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; perovskite planes are prone to stacking faults formation in all leading formamidinium-rich perovskite compositions. Using ethylene thiourea as a precursor additive, Othman et&#160;al. suppress those vulnerable facets, significantly enhancing the absorber's intrinsic stability under various operational conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poor intrinsic perovskite absorber stability is arguably a central limitation challenging the prospect of commercialization for photovoltaic (PV) applications. Understanding the nanoscopic structural features that trigger instabilities in perovskite materials is essential to mitigate device degradation. Using nanostructure characterization techniques, we observe the local degradation to be initiated by material loss at stacking faults, forming inherently in the (011)-faceted perovskite domains in different formamidinium lead triiodide perovskite compositions. We introduce Ethylene Thiourea (ETU) as an additive into the perovskite precursor, which manipulates the perovskite crystal growth and results in dominantly in-and out-of-plane (001) oriented perovskite domains. Combining in-depth experimental analysis and density functional theory calculations, we find that ETU lowered the perovskite formation energy, readily enabling crystallization of the perovskite phase at room temperature without the need for an antisolvent quenching step. This facilitated the fabrication of high-quality large area 5 cm by 5 cm blade-coated perovskite films and devices. Encapsulated and unmasked ETU-treated devices, with an active area of 0.2 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, retained &amp;gt; 93 % of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) for &amp;gt; 2100 hours at room temperature, and additionally, 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ETU-treated devices maintained T80 (the duration for the PCE to decay to 80 % of the initial value) for &amp;gt; 600 hours at 65 &#176;C, under continuous 1-sun illumination at the maximum power point in ambient conditions.

It offers an in&#8208;depth introduction to the distinctive properties exhibited by these materials and delves into the device structures tailored specifically for image sensor applications. The classification of novel image sensors based on low&#8208;dimensional materials, in particular for transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), covering the preparation methods and corresponding imaging characteristics, is explored. Furthermore, this review highlights the diverse applications of low&#8208;dimensional materials in next&#8208;generation image sensors, encompassing advanced imaging sensors, biomimetic vision sensors, and non&#8208;von Neumann imaging systems. Lastly, the challenges and opportunities encountered in the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors utilizing low&#8208;dimensional semiconductor materials, paving the way for further advancements in this rapidly evolving field, are proposed.

         <title>High&#8208;Oriented SnO2 Nanocrystals for Air&#8208;Processed Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with an Efficiency of 23.87%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DAC&#8208;AA into SnO2 colloids favors the crystalline phase and preferential orientation along high&#8208;oriented (101) and (200) crystal planes by reducing surface absorption energy and modulating crystal thermodynamics, promoting heating transfer rate in the flexible PEN substrate and favoring perovskite/SnO2 lattice matching. The f&#8208;PSCs fabricated in full&#8208;air conditions produce an efficiency of 23.87% and exceptional mechanical stability.








Abstract
Tin (IV) oxide (SnO2) electron transport layer (ETL) emerges as the most promising n&#8208;type semiconductor material for flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs). The (110) facet&#8208;dominated SnO2 colloids are readily created, whereas other best&#8208;performing (101) and (200) facets&#8208;dominated ones with superior potential in interface modulation and lattice matching remain insufficiently explored. Here water&#8208;soluble acryloyloxyethyltrimethyl ammonium chloride&#8208;acrylamine (DAC&#8208;AA) doping into SnO2 colloids produces more (101)&#8208; and (200)&#8208;oriented crystal domains through lowering surface absorption energy and offering additional thermodynamic driving force. Theoretical and experimental analyses corroborate that the grain preference orientation induced by DAC&#8208;AA modification strengthens heating transfer rate on the flexible substrate and favors lattice matching of perovskite (100) plane on SnO2 (101) and (200) facets. Accordingly, the champion f&#8208;PSCs on high&#8208;oriented SnO2&#8208;DAC&#8208;AA ETLs fabricated fully in ambient air conditions achieve the efficiencies of 23.87% and 22.41% with aperture areas of 0.092 and 1 cm2. In parallel, the propitious interfacial lattice arrangement attenuates the formation of micro&#8208;strain inside perovskite films, maintaining 92.5% of their initial performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles with a curvature radius of 6&#160;mm.

         <title>Reprogrammable Mechanical Metamaterials via Passive and Active Magnetic Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of flexible matrices with embedded hard&#8208;magnetic nodes enables metastructures with reprogrammable mechanical properties, even in the absence of external magnetic fields. The evolving interaction between nodes during structural deformation allows mechanical tunability under quasi&#8208;static and dynamic loading, and bistable transitions. This approach enables engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable via magnetic element redistribution or applied fields.








Abstract
This study experimentally demonstrates the reprogrammability of a rotating&#8208;squares&#8208;based mechanical metamaterial with an embedded array of permanent magnets. How the orientation, residual magnetization, and stiffness of the magnets influence both the static and dynamic responses of the metamaterial is systematically investigated. It is showed that by carefully tuning the magnet orientation within the metamaterial, notable tunability of the metamaterial response can be achieved across static and dynamic regimes. More complex magnetic node configurations can optimize specific structural responses by decoupling the tunability of quasi&#8208;static stress&#8211;strain behavior from energy absorption under impact loading. Additionally, reprogrammability can be further enhanced by an external magnetic field, which modulates magnetic interactions within the structure. This work paves the way for developing engineered structural components with adaptable mechanical responses, reprogrammable through either the redistribution of magnetic elements or the application of an external magnetic&#160;field.

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Chiral Aluminum Oxyhydroxide Supraparticles as Adjuvants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are fabricated as an adjuvant, indicating that that L&#8208;SPs enters dendritic cells (DCs) via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2) to enhance NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation.








Abstract
Aluminum&#8208;based adjuvants dominate global vaccine formulations owing to their proven efficacy in humoral immunity induction. However, their inherent limitations in activating cellular immunity pose critical challenges for vaccine development. In this study, chiral flower&#8208;like aluminum oxyhydroxide (AlOOH) supraparticles (SPs) are synthesized via a one&#8208;pot hydrothermal method using cysteine (Cys) enantiomers as chiral ligands, achieving a g&#8208;factor of 0.004. L&#8208;AlOOH SPs (L&#8208;SPs) demonstrate significantly greater enhancement in dendritic cell (DC) maturation and antigen cross&#8208;presentation efficiency compared to D&#8208;AlOOH SPs (D&#8208;SPs), indicating its potential as an adjuvant. Mechanistic studies reveal that L&#8208;SPs enter DCs via Toll&#8208;like receptor 2 (TLR2), thereby enhancing NOD&#8208;like receptor thermal protein domain associated protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activation. In vivo experiments show that L&#8208;SPs generate 21.59&#8208;fold higher OVA&#8208;specific antibody titers than commercial aluminum adjuvants. Further studies show that L&#8208;SPs, after mixed with H9N2 virus proteins, enhance influenza virus antibody titers by 15.28&#8208;fold, with sustained protection, confirming its translational potential. This study demonstrates the performance of chiral AlOOH SPs to simultaneously amplify humoral and cellular immunological responses, entering it as a promising next&#8208;generation adjuvant for cancer immunotherapy and pandemic preparedness.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Emissive CuInS2/ZnS Quantum Dot&#8208;Embedded Polymer Scaffolds for Photon Upconversion Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) are developed via template&#8208;assisted cation exchange, enabling photon upconversion (UC) with NIR&#8208;I emission, a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV), and high PLQY (&#8776;0.95). The QDs are incorporated into a 3D&#8208;printed polymer matrix, forming a scaffold with strong optical contrast under UC imaging. This system enables high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging for surgical guidance, even under interference layers.








Abstract
A facile synthesis and application of photon upconversion (UC) probes, CuInS&#8322;/ZnS quantum dots (nCIS QDs) is presented, which exhibits&#160;near&#8208;infrared (NIR) spectral emission. The nCIS QDs are synthesized via a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange reaction during a heating process, resulting in NIR&#8208;I emission with a large Stokes shift (&#8776;650 meV) and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY, &#8776;0.95). This behavior is attributed to a template&#8208;assisted cation&#8208;exchange mechanism that produces a wurtzite crystal structure and deep defect states, leading to a relatively long fluorescence lifetime (&#8776;5 &#181;s). The quantum confinement effect allows for the emission of light at different wavelengths by adjusting the size of the nanocrystals. Moreover, their deep defect states facilitate photon UC via a self&#8208;trapping triplet&#8208;triplet annihilation mechanism. The promising potential of the nCIS QDs is explored in UC imaging, demonstrating high&#8208;contrast NIR imaging under IR vision modules, even in the presence of interference layers. It suggests potential applications in surgical guidance and future biomedical imaging.

         <title>Recent Advances in Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Materials and Soft Robotic Actuators for Bioelectronic Medicine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the integration of responsive materials and soft robotic actuators with implantable electronics to address key challenges in bioelectronic medicine. By enabling shape actuation, these technologies improve deployment, adaptability, and accuracy in minimally invasive procedures. The review discusses actuation mechanisms, device designs, and future opportunities for intelligent, responsive implants with enhanced therapeutic and diagnostic capabilities.








Abstract
Bioelectronic medicine uses implantable electronic devices to interface with electrically active tissues and transform the way disease is diagnosed and treated. One of the biggest challenges is the development of minimally invasive devices that can be deployed to patients at scale. Responsive materials and soft robotic actuators offer unique opportunities to make bioelectronic devices with shape actuation, promising to address the limitations of existing rigid and passive systems, including difficult deployment, mechanical mismatch with soft tissues, and limited adaptability in minimally invasive settings. In this review, an overview is provided of smart materials and soft robotic technologies that show promises for implantable use, discussing advantages and limitations of underlying actuation mechanisms. Examples are then presented where soft actuating mechanisms are combined with microelectrodes to create shape actuating bioelectronic devices. Opportunities and challenges for next&#8208;generation intelligent bioelectronic devices assisted by responsive materials and soft robotic actuators are then discussed. These innovations may allow electronic implants to safely navigate to target areas inside the body and establish large area and spatiotemporally controlled interfaces for diagnostic or therapeutic procedures that are minimally invasive.

         <title>Glow&#8208;Worm&#8208;Inspired Fluorescent Self&#8208;Healing Actuators for Soft Robot and Reconfigurable Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a high&#8208;performance multifunctional fluorescent actuator is fabricated by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with self&#8208;healing materials. It integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function enables reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. This actuator opens new paths to soft robots and reconfigurable information encryption.








Abstract
Fluorescent actuators with light&#8208;emitting and shape&#8208;deformation properties are promising in bionics and soft robotics. However, current fluorescent actuators barely balance actuation performances with fluorescence properties, as they exhibit insufficient brightness, poor color&#8208;purity, low&#8208;stability, and few functional&#8208;integrations, limiting their applications in complex scenarios. Herein, inspired by glow&#8208;worms, a multifunctional fluorescent actuator by combining ultra&#8208;stable perovskite quantum dots with polyurethane and graphene oxide composites is reported, which integrates large deformation, high brightness, high color&#8208;purity, color&#8208;changing function and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing function together. The actuator shows a large bending curvature of 2.48&#160;cm&#8722;1. It exhibits excellent fluorescence performances, such as quantum yields as high as 58.88% and full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum as narrow as 21&#160;nm. The actuation and fluorescence properties show long&#8208;term stability during more than 1100 cycles of near&#8208;infrared irradiation and 12&#160;h of ultraviolet exposure. Moreover, the actuator is integrated with color&#8208;changing and full&#8208;device self&#8208;healing functions, enabling a synergetic color/shape change and reconfigurable on&#8208;demand fluorescent patterns. Then, a smart gripper and a crawling robot with crawling/rollover motions are demonstrated. Finally, a non&#8208;contact dynamic display of reconfigurable encrypted information driven by light is fabricated to mimic light communications of glow&#8208;worms. This actuator demonstrates unprecedented multifunctionality, opening new avenues for fluorescent soft robotics.

         <title>Neuromorphic Transistors Integrating Photo&#8208;Sensor, Optical Memory and Visual Synapses for Artificial Vision Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a neuromorphic transistor integrating sensing, memory, and computing in one device to address the challenges of commercial artificial vision system. By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo&#8208;sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1), a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level optical memory (&gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.








Abstract
In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate&#8208;tunable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane electric field, the device achieves the multi&#8208;mode integration of photo&#8208;sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (VTG), a strong photo&#8208;gating effect enables highly sensitive photo&#8208;response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&#8722;1 and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 1014 Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;level (&gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 106. At zero or positive VTG, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi&#8208;mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all&#8208;in&#8208;one integration and manufacturing complexity.

By varying top gate voltages, it can operate as an ultrasensitive photo-sensor (&#8776;6.515 kA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), a non-volatile multi-level optical memory (&amp;gt;4 bits), and a neuromorphic visual synapse with 95.26% image recognition accuracy by combing artificial neural network model.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In commercial artificial vision system (AVS), the sensing, storage, and computing units are usually physically separated due to their architecture and performance gaps, which thus increases the volume, complexity, and energy loss. This work develops a neuromorphic transistor integrating these different modules within one single device. Leveraging the gate-tunable out-of-plane electric field, the device achieves the multi-mode integration of photo-sensor, optical memory, and visual synapse. When operating at negative top gate voltage (V&lt;sub&gt;TG&lt;/sub&gt;), a strong photo-gating effect enables highly sensitive photo-response with responsivity of &#8776;6.515 kA W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and detectivity up to &#8776;3.92 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt; Jones. Due to the charge storage effect, it can also act as a non-volatile multi-level (&amp;gt;4 bits) optical memory with a long endurance of over 10&#160;000 s and a high writing/erasing ratio of up to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. At zero or positive V&lt;sub&gt;TG&lt;/sub&gt;, the transistor switches to visual synapse mode with neuromorphic computing capability, providing a pathway for complex biological learning and flexible synaptic plasticity. By further combining the synaptic plasticity with an artificial neural network (ANN), it achieves precise image recognition and classification with an accuracy of up to 95.26%. This work develops a multi-mode transistor that integrates key components of an AVS, addressing the existing challenges of all-in-one integration and manufacturing complexity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inverse Opal Photonic Crystal Structured Bifacial&#8208;Iridescent Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel bifacial&#8208;iridescent solar cell is developed using an inverse opal perovskite photonic crystal. It exhibited unique iridescent structural colors on both sides and achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency of 18.00% for small cells and 12.77% for mini&#8208;modules.








Abstract
Colorful perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent potential for building&#8208;integrated photovoltaics (BIPVs), which increase the utilization of clean power. However, their efficiencies are lower than those of uncolored devices. Moreover, traditional mono&#8208;facial colored devices cannot satisfy diverse BIPV scenarios. Here a bifacial iridescent solar cell (BFI&#8208;SC) is developed,&#160;constructed by inverse opal (IO) perovskite photonic crystals and transparent front and rear electrodes. The developed BFI&#8208;SC exhibited bright vivid colors on both sides, which originate from the reflection at the photonic stop band of the IO perovskite photonic crystal. Moreover, this unique IO photonic crystal decreased the interfacial Fresnel reflection and generated a slow&#8208;photon effect, which increases the material light absorption and utilization to obtain high efficiency. Furthermore, the BFI&#8208;SC can harvest light from both sides, considerably enhancing the device efficiency. Thus, the BFI&#8208;SC achieved an impressive bifacial equivalent efficiency (&#951;eq) of 18.00%, which is the highest value achieved for the reported multicolored (or iridescent) solar cell. A larger&#8208;scale BFI&#8208;SC module is successfully assembled, achieving a champion &#951;eq of 12.77%. In addition, another perovskite material with an IO structure and wide&#8208;bandgap components exhibited vivid colors on both sides, indicating the universality of this coloring strategy and its independence of the perovskite components.

         <title>Strut&#8208;Buckling Transformation Enabling Anomalous Density&#8208;Scaling Toughening Law in Ultralight Lattice Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uncovers an anomalous density&#8208;scaling toughening law in discrete lattices, where ultrahigh&#160;specific fracture toughness can be achieved at ultralow relative density, thereby filling gaps in material property space. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying sizes, topologies, and component properties.








Abstract
Lightweight lattice metamaterials attract considerable attention due to their exceptional and tunable mechanical properties. However, their practical application is ultimately limited by their tolerance to inevitable&#160;manufacturing defects. Traditional fracture mechanics of lattice metamaterials are confined to localized tensile failure of a crack&#8208;tip strut, overlooking the toughening effect of buckling instability in discrete struts around the crack front. Here, via a combination of additive manufacturing, numerical simulation, and theoretical analysis, this work identifies an anomalous power scaling law of specific fracture energy with relative density, where the scaling exponent shifts to negative values below a critical relative density. This anomalous toughening law stems from crack&#8208;tip blunting triggered by delocalized strut&#8208;buckling transformation at ultralow densities, which is universal across various lattice metamaterials with varying length scales, crack orientations, node connectivity, and component properties. By strategically harnessing strut buckling mechanisms, exceptionally high specific fracture toughness can be achieved at extremely low relative density, thereby addressing gaps in the material property design space. These findings not only provide physical insights into discrete lattice fracture but also offer design motifs for ultralight, ultra&#8208;tough lattice metamaterials.

         <title>Inhalable Ce Nanozyme&#8208;Backpacked Phage Aims at Ischemic Cerebral Injury by M1&#8208;Microglia Hitchhiking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study developed a bio&#8208;active, inhalable nanozyme&#8208;backpacked M13 phage (CZM) which specifically delivers to the ischemic core via the olfactory bulb pathway. Leveraging M1&#8208;microglia hitchhiking, CZM accumulates specifically at the lesion site, scavenging reactive oxygen species (ROS) to mitigate neuroinflammation and neuronal apoptosis, providing a safe and effective strategy for the precise treatment of neuroinflammatory disorders.








Abstract
There is a desperate need for precise nanomedications to treat ischemic cerebral injury. Yet, the drawbacks of poor delivery efficiency and off&#8208;target toxicity in pathologic parenchyma for traditional antioxidants against ischemic stroke result in inadequate brain accumulation. M13 bacteriophages are highly phagocytosed by M1&#8208;polarized microglia and can be carried toward the neuroinflammatory sites. Here, a bio&#8208;active, inhalable, Ce0.9Zr0.1O2&#8208;backpacked&#8208;M13 phage (abbreviated as CZM) is developed and demonstrates how M13 bacteriophages are taken up by different phenotypes&#8217; microglia. With the M1 microglia's proliferating and migrating, CZM can be extensively and specifically delivered to the site of the ischemic core and penumbra, where the surviving nerve cells need to be shielded from secondary oxidative stress and inflammatory cascade initiated by reactive oxygen species (ROS). With non&#8208;invasive administration, CZM effectively alleviates oxidative damage and apoptosis of neurons by eliminating ROS generated by hyperactive M1&#8208;polarized microglia. Here, a secure and effective strategy for the targeted therapy of neuroinflammatory maladies is offered by this research.

         <dc:description>
A ZVO/RuO2 cathode is designed by coupling Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO) and RuO2 through interfacial V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds in which a dynamic reversible breakage and reconstruction of V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru, which provide a reversible electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO, making RuO2 as an additional electron acceptor and donor, accelerating the migration kinetics of H+/Zn2+ in ZVO.








Abstract
Intercalation&#8208;type layered vanadium oxides have been widely explored as cathode materials for aqueous zinc&#8211;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, attaining both high power density and superior stability remains a formidable challenge. Herein, layered vanadium oxides are pre&#8208;intercalated with Zn2+ to form Zn0.85V10O24&#183;7.4H2O (ZVO), which is then combined with RuO2 nanoparticles to construct a ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure featuring interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds. ZVO/RuO2 heterostructure exhibits a dynamic stable coupling at the interphase via V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru chemical bonds reconstruction during discharging/charging processes. The dynamically reversible reconstruction of interphase V&#9472;O&#9472;Ru bonds provides a fast electron transfer channel between RuO2 and ZVO cathode, as demonstrated by ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, making RuO2 an additional electron acceptor and donor, and accelerating the migration of H+/Zn2+ in layered ZVO cathode. Therefore, an ultra&#8208;high capacity (411 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, 225 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1) and long cycling stability (a retention of 92.2% at 20 A g&#8722;1 over 20000 cycles) performances are achieved. This interphase reversible reconstruction route provides a promising approach to achieving excellent cycling stability in cathode materials.

         <title>Boosted Hydrogen Evolution via Photoinduced Hole Transfer in Molecular&#8208;Level Organic Heterojunction under NIR Photon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type electron acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F is designed, synthesized and integrated with donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T to achieve full&#8208;spectrum light harvesting. PBDB&#8208;T:BTPT&#8208;IC4F nanoparticles exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm, which is attributed to efficient hole extraction from BTPT&#8208;IC4F* (excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F) to PBDB&#8208;T phase in the molecular&#8208;level heterojunction under pure near&#8208;infrared (NIR) photon excitation.









Abstract
The energy of sunlight is predominantly concentrated in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, posing a paramount limitation for practical application of conventional photocatalysts. Organic semiconductors can offer NIR absorption and tunable energy levels simultaneously through molecular engineering, which presents great potential in solar&#8208;driven catalysis. However, an individual organic semiconductor typically generates Frenkel excitons with large binding energy, hindering efficient electron&#8208;hole separation. Herein, we develop molecular&#8208;level heterojunction to suppress electron&#8208;hole recombination, thereby achieving a boosted hydrogen (H2) evolution reaction rate of 25.54&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 (12.77&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1) under visible&#8211;near&#8208;infrared (Vis&#8211;NIR) light. Surprisingly, heterojunction nanoparticles (NPs) comprising donor polymer PBDB&#8208;T matched with an A&#8208;D1&#8208;D2&#8208;D1&#8208;A type acceptor BTPT&#8208;IC4F exhibit a promising external quantum efficiency of 6.3% at 730&#160;nm. Transient absorption spectroscopy monitors effective extraction of photogenerated holes from the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of BTPT&#8208;IC4F to the HOMO of PBDB&#8208;T, while first&#8208;principle calculations confirm the prolonged lifetime of excited BTPT&#8208;IC4F due to efficient hole capture by the PBDB&#8208;T phase. The outstanding performance of heterojunction NPs under NIR light is ascribed to strong hole transfer within the nanoparticle. This study provides valuable insights for designing molecular&#8208;level organic heterojunction photocatalysts toward NIR light&#8208;driven H2 evolution and other potential reactions.

         <title>Manipulating Sulfur Redox Kinetics in Rechargeable Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Fundamental Principles and Universal Methodologies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review uncovers the commonalities of rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in aspects of sulfur redox reactions (electrochemical fundamentals, reaction mechanisms, innate challenges, and key influence factors) and advanced targeted methodologies to boost sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The existing shackles confronted by rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries and their future development directions are prospected as well.








Abstract
The profound understanding of chemical reaction essence and kinetic behaviors is crucial to develop rechargeable battery technologies. Based on multi&#8208;electron conversion, sulfur redox reactions hold great promise for establishing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density, and longstanding rechargeable batteries. However, the sulfur redox reaction processes suffer from a series of common daunting cruxes, leading to incomplete redox reactions and inferior battery performance when working in rechargeable batteries. These innate challenges of sulfur redox reactions include poor sulfur reactivity, sluggish charge transmission, severe polysulfide shuttling, high redox energy barrier, and undesirable reaction reversibility. Accordingly, it becomes a consensus to effectively manipulate sulfur redox kinetics for developing competent rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. Herein, this review centers on sulfur redox reactions, within the compass of understanding electrochemical fundamentals, principles, thermodynamics, dynamics, and kinetics as well as emphatically presents universal methodologies to boost sulfur redox reaction kinetics in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. The unique viewpoint on sulfur redox reactions in rechargeable metal&#8211;sulfur batteries can provide a deepened understanding of sulfur electrochemistry and lead to new insights into the sulfur cathode designs and battery configurations, thus accelerating reaction kinetics of sulfur cathodes and promoting practical progress on high&#8208;energy&#8208;density battery technologies.

         <title>Probing into Intraband Transitions Enabled Charge Carrier Dynamics of THz Response Generated in Graphene/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Investigation of charge carrier dynamics in graphene/ MoS2 heterostructures under photoexcitation, revealing associated intraband THz responses. The study highlights charge transfer mechanisms and carrier lifetimes, advancing the understanding of light&#8208;matter interactions in 2D materials for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The engineering of terahertz phonons is challenging due to difficulties in achieving sub&#8208;nanometer material precision and in facilitating efficient phonon coupling at terahertz frequencies region. The effective generation, detection, and manipulation of terahertz phonons via the integration of atomically thin layers in van der Waals heterostructures can enable new designs for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic quantum devices, offering new avenues for thermal engineering in the terahertz regime. Here, optical pump terahertz probe and terahertz time&#8208;domain experiments are used to reveal the behavior of charge carrier transfer in real time at heterostructure interfaces of single&#8208;layer graphene and monolayer MoS2 upon photoexcitation and plausible mechanism has been put forward. Moreover, a temperature&#8208;dependent terahertz response of GM heterostructure along with experimental observation is explored in detail with considered appropriate theoretical models. These insights can prove valuable for designing the next generation of optoelectronic applications with stacked 2D heterostructures within the terahertz bandwidth.

         <title>Thermally Activated Swelling and Wetting Transition of Frozen Polymer Brushes:a New Concept for Surface Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel approach is introduced that&#160;leverages polymer phase transitions to modulate brush behavior. The oleophilic bottle brush system exhibits two distinct melting transitions&#8212;bulk and surface&#8212;enabling a two&#8208;stage swelling and wetting transition. These transitions can be controlled globally, or locally with a focused laser beam, offering a new strategy for designing adaptive surfaces based on intrinsic polymer properties.









Abstract
Functional polymer brush coatings have great potential for various industrial applications thanks to their ability to adapt to environmental stimuli, providing tunable surface properties. While existing approaches rely on polymer&#8208;solvent interactions and their response to external stimuli, changes in the intrinsic physical properties of the polymer also play a critical role in modulating brush behavior. In this context, the melting transition of a semicrystalline oleophilic poly&#8208;octadecylmethacrylate (P18MA) brush coating is shown to drive a swelling and wetting transition upon exposure to various liquid alkanes. The top surface of this polymer displays a somewhat higher melting temperature than the bulk, enabling separate control of the bulk&#8208;driven swelling and surface&#8208;driven wetting transitions. Laser&#8208;induced heating enables reversible on&#8208;demand activation of both transitions with micrometer lateral resolution. These findings suggest a new concept of polymer brush&#8208;based functional surfaces that allow for controlled fluid transport via separately switchable surface barriers and bulk transport layers based on a suitable choice of polymer&#8208;polymer and polymer&#8208;solvent interactions.

         <title>Flexible 3D Kirigami Probes for In Vitro and In Vivo Neural Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A customizable and scalable approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami microelectrode arrays (MEAs) featuring up to 128 shanks, including surface and penetrating electrodes designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns.








Abstract
3D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain&#8211;machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding 2D MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D kirigami MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1&#160;mm. The 3D kirigami MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D kirigami MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large&#8208;scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.

&lt;p&gt;A customizable and scalable approach to fabricate flexible 3D &lt;i&gt;kirigami&lt;/i&gt; microelectrode arrays (MEAs) featuring up to 128 shanks, including surface and penetrating electrodes designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. The 3D &lt;i&gt;kirigami&lt;/i&gt; MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;3D microelectrode arrays (MEAs) are gaining popularity as brain&#8211;machine interfaces and platforms for studying electrophysiological activity. Interactions with neural tissue depend on the electrochemical, mechanical, and spatial features of the recording platform. While planar or protruding 2D MEAs are limited in their ability to capture neural activity across layers, existing 3D platforms still require advancements in manufacturing scalability, spatial resolution, and tissue integration. In this work, a customizable, scalable, and straightforward approach to fabricate flexible 3D &lt;i&gt;kirigami&lt;/i&gt; MEAs containing both surface and penetrating electrodes, designed to interact with the 3D space of neural tissue, is presented. These novel probes feature up to 512 electrodes distributed across 128 shanks in a single flexible device, with shank heights reaching up to 1&#160;mm. The 3D &lt;i&gt;kirigami&lt;/i&gt; MEAs are successfully deployed in several neural applications, both in vitro and in vivo, and identified spatially dependent electrophysiological activity patterns. Flexible 3D &lt;i&gt;kirigami&lt;/i&gt; MEAs are therefore a powerful tool for large-scale electrical sampling of complex neural tissues while improving tissue integration and offering enhanced capabilities for analyzing neural disorders and disease models where high spatial resolution is required.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Charge&#8208;Coupled Phototransistor Enabling Synchronous Dynamic and Static Image Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.








Abstract
Emerging machine vision applications require efficient detection of both dynamic events and static grayscale information within visual scenes. Current dynamic vision and active pixel sensors (DAVIS) technology integrates event&#8208;driven vision sensors and active pixel sensors within single pixels. However, the complex multi&#8208;component pixel architecture, typically requiring 15&#8211;50 transistors, limits integration density, increases power consumption, and complicates clock synchronization. Here, a charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor is presented that uses dual photosensitive capacitors to provide gate voltage to a single transistor channel, enabling simultaneous capture of dynamic and static information, surpassing existing DAVIS technology. Under illumination, both top and bottom gates generate photogenerated electrons through a charge&#8208;coupling effect; electrons in the top gate are blocked by a thick dielectric layer, producing a stable current change for static grayscale detection, while electrons in the bottom gate tunnel through a thin dielectric layer, creating transient current spikes for dynamic event detection. This device demonstrates a dynamic range of 120&#160;dB and a response time of 15 &#181;s, comparable to traditional DAVIS pixels, while significantly reducing power consumption to 10&#160;pW and overcoming clock synchronization issues. This charge&#8208;coupled phototransistor paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power, and highly integrated machine vision technology.

         <title>Artificial Mitochondrial Nanorobots Deliver Energy In Vivo by Oral Administration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oral artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) can treat ischemic heart disease by delivering ATP to damaged cardiomyocytes, modulating oxidative stress, and restoring cell viability. It improves energy metabolism and mitochondrial structure and reduces inflammation at the genetic level, providing a universal and innovative approach to repair therapies for mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases.








Abstract
Delivering energy in vivo is essential for treating mitochondrial damage&#8208;related diseases. Current methods, including natural mitochondrial transplantation and artificial energy delivery systems, lack non&#8208;destructive, external energy&#8208;free, and clinically viable potential solutions. Here, artificial mitochondrial nanorobots (AMNs) carrying high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds rebuild the in vivo energy supply system to provide energy. Using ischemic heart disease (IHD) as an energy&#8208;deficient disease model and the oral route, which has high patient compliance and facilitates long&#8208;term administration, to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of AMNs. AMNs remain stable in the gastrointestinal tract, cross the intestinal barrier via a barrier&#8208;crossing unit, and target damaged heart tissue and cardiomyocytes using a motion unit chemotactically. Intracellularly, their energy&#8208;generating unit provides high&#8208;energy phosphate bonds for ATP synthesis (duration 12&#160;h), while synergistically reducing inflammation and restoring cell viability. At the same frequency of administration, oral AMNs (50&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) match intravenous AMNs (10 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) in therapeutic efficacy, offering a convenient approach to improving cardiac function. Transcriptomics confirm that 200&#160;&#181;g AMNs emulate 5 &#215; 10&#8310; natural mitochondria, restoring energy metabolism and structural function in damaged hearts at the genetic level. This innovative design opens a new pathway for the construction of artificial energy delivery systems in vivo.

         <title>Uniaxiality&#8208;Induced Reduced&#8208;Pressure Synthesis of Ultrahard Paracrystalline Diamond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;type sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon, is synthesized at 16 GPa (vs. 30 GPa in previous reports) via uniaxial stress&#8208;induced collapse of C60 at lower pressures. By integrating experimental and computational insights, this work opens avenues for designing novel materials through controlled stress environments under pressure and offers a strategy for low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure material production.








Abstract
Synthesizing fully sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon remains a long&#8208;standing challenge due to the intrinsic instability of the sp3 bond at ambient pressure. Recently, paracrystalline diamond, a new&#8208;form sp3&#8208;bonded non&#8208;crystalline carbon consisting of sub&#8208;nanometer&#8208;sized paracrystallites, has been synthesized from face&#8208;centered cubic C60 at 30&#160;GPa, which has attracted attention due to its unique structural features and excellent physical properties. However, the ultrahigh synthesis pressure of paracrystalline diamond poses an obstacle to its large&#8208;scale production and applications. In this study, paracrystalline diamond is synthesized at an exceptionally low pressure (16 GPa) via inducing uniaxiality at high&#8208;pressure and high&#8208;temperature conditions, thereby breaking through the temperature&#8208;pressure phase diagram of C60. By combining structural characteristics and advanced molecular dynamics simulation, the remarkable reduction of synthesis pressure is attributed to the fact that the symmetry of the C60 cage is broken due to the uniaxiality, which further allows the C60 cage to collapse at much lower pressures. This work reveals the critical role of uniaxiality in the reduced&#8208;pressure synthesis of paracrystalline diamond, which may provide a potent methodological strategy for the development of novel low&#8208;cost high&#8208;pressure materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Integrated Micro&#8208;Vortex Air Filter Enabled With Honeycomb&#8208;Like Structured Nanofibrous Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cellular cell micro&#8208;vortex air filter constructed by 3D honeycomb&#8208;like structured nano&#8208;networks is created by a unique electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly technique. Due to the micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode of cellular cells, 3D porous cell walls (average pore size &#8776;410 nm) consisting of nano&#8208;scaled fibers (diameter 45 nm), enhanced air slip effect, our filters achieve high&#8208;efficiency and low&#8208;resistance PM0.3 removal, desirable dust holding capacity and remarkable biodegradibility.








Abstract
Particulate matter (PM) pollution has posed a serious threat to public health, especially with the outbreak of respiratory infections. However, most existing fiber filters face an inevitable trade&#8208;off between removal efficiency and air resistance, due to their thick fibers and uncontrolled flat stacking structure. Herein, a unique high&#8208;performance integrated micro&#8208;vortex filter is created using honeycomb&#8208;like structured cellular nanofibrous networks via the innovative electro&#8208;netting&#8208;assembly nanotechnique for air filtration. Manipulation of the ejection, deformation, and self&#8208;assembly of the charged droplets from the Taylor cone enables the one&#8208;step construction of 3D cellular cells with 2D nano architectured networks consisted of 1D nanowires with a diameter of &#8776;45&#160;nm on a large&#8208;scale. The resultant micro&#8208;vortex air filter, functioned as an integrated filter system, achieved a remarkable air slip effect and striking micro&#8208;vortex cascade filtration mode, showing &gt;99.97% PM0.3 removal, &#8776;0.12% atmosphere pressure of air resistance, 27&#160;g m&#8722;2 dust holding, along with robust mechanical stability. This work may provide a promising avenue for the design and development of novel separation and purification materials.

         <title>Solid Polymer Electrolytes for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Different Designs Dependent on Their Interaction with Sulfur Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The different designs between the strategies used for solid polymer electrolyte (SPE)&#8208;based lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) and those from SPE based Li batteries and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs caused by the unique interactions of SPEs with S cathodes are successively reviewed. Subsequently, several challenges that need to be urgently addressed and the future prospects of SPE&#8208;containing LSBs are discussed.









Abstract
Nonflammable and flexible solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) are widely studied to improve the safety of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Studies on SPE&#8208;based LSBs primarily focus on addressing issues stemming from poor SPE properties, Li dendrites, and &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; of polysulfides. Currently, strategies from SPE&#8208;based lithium batteries (without sulfur cathodes) and liquid electrolyte (LE)&#8208;based LSBs (without SPEs) are the most commonly employed approaches to tackle above issues. These strategies are designed without taking into account the problems caused by the coexistence of SPEs and sulfur cathodes, resulting in SPE&#8208;based LSBs exhibiting significantly inferior performance than liquid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based LSBs. Therefore, the strategies for SPE&#8208;based LSBs necessitate different designs. However, no reviews have focused on the aforementioned differences and analyzing their corresponding causes thus far, which is unfavorable for the development of this field. Herein, the emerging advances in SPE&#8208;based LSBs are comprehensively reviewed. In particular, for the first time, the different designs and their corresponding causes are comprehensively discussed. These causes include the high adsorption strength of SPEs with polysulfides, corrosion of polysulfides to barrier layers, deterioration of the ionic conductivity of SPEs, and defective interfaces between cathodes and SPEs. Finally, several pressing challenges and future prospects for the field are discussed.

         <title>Interface&#8208;Engineered Polar Topological Domains in Ferroelectric Nematic Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative interfacial engineering strategy has been proposed to construct and modulate polar topological domains within ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals. These ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, featuring diverse and adjustable polar topological structures including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent domains, hold significant potential for applications in the field of topological photonics.








Abstract
Polar topological domains, distinguished by their inherent topological protection and diverse optoelectronic functionalities, have recently attracted significant interest across scientific disciplines. However, the realization of these structures in inorganic materials is often impeded by crystal symmetry constraints. In this context, ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, characterized by spontaneous polarization and flexible polarization orientation, provide an exceptional platform for the development of polar topological domains. Despite their potential, a considerable challenge lies in identifying a straightforward yet versatile approach for engineering polar topological domains within liquid crystals. Here, this study presents an interfacial engineering strategy that effectively stabilizes a range of polar topological domains in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, including vortex, centrifugal vortex, and center&#8208;divergent configurations, by synergistically modulating the surface tension and interfacial tension. Utilizing a combination of experimental characterization and simulation, the role of anchoring energy is systematically investigated in the molecular alignment of liquid crystals and facilitates transitions between diverse topological structures. This research not only extends the horizons for constructing and manipulating polar topological domains but also enhances their prospective applications in topological photonics.

         <title>Legumain In Situ Engineering Promotes Efferocytosis of CAR Macrophage to Treat Cardiac Fibrosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research article, the authors found that the overwhelming apoptotic cells after myocardial infarction (MI) result in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. To address this challenge, an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) is developed to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability.








Abstract
Uncontrolled and excessive cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI) is a primary contributor to mortality by heart failure. Chimeric antigen receptor macrophage (CAR&#8208;M&#934;) therapy shows great promise in cardiac fibrosis, however, the overwhelming apoptotic cells after MI results in an overburdened efferocytosis in CAR&#8208;M&#934;, which compromises their antifibrotic potency. This work here reports an in situ engineered legumain (Lgmn) to elevate the cargo degradation of phagolysosome for promoting the efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, restoring their antifibrotic capability. Specifically, with the in&#8208;house customized macrophages&#8208;targeting lipid nanoparticles, this work first creates an efferocytosis&#8208;boosted fibrosis&#8208;specific CAR&#8208;M&#934;s by introducing dual mRNAs that encode Lgmn, an endolysosomal cysteine protease, along with an anti&#8208;fibroblast activation protein (FAP) CAR, respectively. This data demonstrate these CAR&#8208;M&#934;s displayed a significantly increased phagocytic capacity as well as improved efferocytosis and enhanced antifibrotic capability. Treatment with the in situ reprogrammed CAR&#8208;M&#934;s in MI mice obviously reduced the infarct size and mitigated cardiac fibrosis, leading to significant restoration of cardiac function. In sum, these findings establish that promoting efferocytosis through Lgmn engineering effectively relieved the overburdened efferocytosis of CAR&#8208;M&#934;s, and enhanced their treatment efficacy of cardiac fibrosis with broad application in other fibrotic diseases.

         <title>Decoding Directional Control in Metal&#8208;Assisted Chemical Etching via Catalyst Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) enables silicon nanostructure fabrication but suffers from isotropic undercutting. This study highlights the critical role of catalyst morphology in etching directionality. High&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts induce lateral etching, while thermal treatment at 450&#160;&#176;C stabilizes catalyst geometry, promoting vertical etching. These findings offer a strategy for precise silicon nanostructure control, advancing semiconductor and nanofabrication applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching (MaCE) has emerged as a promising technique for fabricating silicon nanostructures, yet the presence of anomalous isotropic etching poses significant challenges for precise dimensional control. Here, it is demonstrated that catalyst morphology, particularly its aspect ratio, plays a crucial role in determining etching directionality. Through systematic investigation of the initial stages of MaCE, it is revealed that significant undercutting occurs within seconds of etching initiation, persisting across all solution compositions. This phenomenon is quantitatively analyzed using the Degree of Undercutting (DoU) and Degree of Anisotropy (DoA) metrics, establishing that conventional solution chemistry control alone cannot suppress lateral etching. These findings reveal that high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio dendrite catalysts, formed at elevated AgNO3 concentrations, undergo physical separation during etching, leading to residual catalysts that promote localized isotropic etching. To address this, a thermal treatment approach is developed that effectively transforms these problematic structures into stable, low&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio catalysts. A critical transition at 450&#160;&#176;C, where enhanced silver atom mobility coincides with surface defect formation, enables nearly perfect vertical etching. This work not only provides fundamental insights into the relationship between catalyst geometry and etching behavior but also presents a practical solution for achieving precise control over silicon nanostructure fabrication.

         <title>Thermodynamically&#8208;Driven Phase Engineering and Reconstruction Deduction of Medium&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogue Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine learning framework is harnessed to scrutinize the thermodynamically induced crystal phase transition behavior of medium&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (ME&#8208;PBA). This study provides a unified framework for understanding the crystal phase transformation in ME&#8208;PBA and is poised to lay the groundwork for the development of other polymetallic coordination polymer derivatives.









Abstract
Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) are exemplary precursors for the synthesis of a diverse array of derivatives.Yet, the intricate mechanisms underlying phase transitions in these multifaceted frameworks remain a formidable challenge. In this study, a machine learning&#8208;guided analysis of phase transitions in a medium&#8208;entropy PBA system is delineated, utilizing an array of descriptors that encompass crystallographic phases, structural subtleties, and fluctuations in multimetal valence states. By integrating multimodal simulations with experimental validation, a thermodynamics&#8208;driven phase transformation model for medium&#8208;entropy PBA is established and accurately predicted the critical synthesis parameters. A constellation of advanced techniques&#8212;including atomic force microscopy coupled with Kelvin probe force microscopy for individual nanoparticles, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, operando ultraviolet&#8208;visible spectroscopy, in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, theoretical calculations, and multiphysics simulations&#8212;substantiated that the iron oxide@NiCoZnFe&#8208;PBA exhibits both exceptional stability and remarkable electrochemical activity. This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally&#8208;induced derivatives.

This investigation provides profound insights into the phase transition dynamics of polymetallic complexes and propels the rational design of other thermally-induced derivatives.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Responsive Ordered Assembly of Magnetic Nanoparticles for ROS Activatable Magnetic Particle Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (RMNAs) achieve a ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation through the ordered assembly/disassembly&#8208;mediated MPI tuning strategy. Remarkably, the activatable MPI probe, RMNA, demonstrates a 3.98&#8208;fold recovery of MPI signals in response to ROS conditions, enabling ultra&#8208;sensitive monitoring of acute liver injury at a low dosage of 0.05 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1, with a 27&#8208;fold increase in MPI signals compared to the non&#8208;responsive group.








Abstract
Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) has emerged as a versatile biomedical imaging modality, yet a significant challenge persists in the absence of activatable MPI probes for targeted imaging of disease biomarkers. In this study, a reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive ordered assembly of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) is reported, engineered through the meticulous design of magnetic nanoparticle building blocks and ROS&#8208;responsive polymeric ligands, enabling precise control over the assembly structure. This ordered configuration amplifies magnetic dipole&#8208;dipole interactions, raising the energy barrier during nonequilibrium dynamic magnetization and effectively quenching the MPI signal. By modulating the assembly and disassembly of these ordered structures in response to ROS, this nanoprobe achieves ROS&#8208;dependent off/on MPI signal regulation. Consequently, the probe enables the monitoring of early pathological ROS change in a mice model of early acute liver injury, facilitating highly sensitive monitoring of the ROS level&#8208;dependent severity of the disease. This work represents the inaugural application of microenvironment&#8208;responsive MPI probes for the early diagnosis of ROS&#8208;associated diseases. The introduction of ordered assembly structures for MPI signal tuning offers a promising translational approach in the development of next&#8208;generation activatable MPI probes.

         <title>Full&#8208;Color Tunable Time&#8208;Dependent Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence from Self&#8208;Protective Carbonized Polymer Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color tunable time&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) from self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) is achieved via a self&#8208;doping strategy for simultaneous modulation of their carbon core N&#8208;related and surface oxygen&#8208;related emissive centers. The broad emission color, long lifetime, and excellent luminescence stability of these dynamic afterglow materials promote their practical applications in multimodal anti&#8208;counterfeiting and advanced dynamic information encryption, as well as time&#8208;delay light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).








Abstract
Achieving full&#8208;color time&#8208;dependent tunable phosphorescence (TDTP) in pure organic materials remains a significant challenge due to the nonradiative transition and modulation puzzle of triplet states. Herein, full&#8208;color TDTP has been realized in self&#8208;protective carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) under ambient conditions using a self&#8208;doping strategy. These CPDs are generated with dual emission centers of the high&#8208;energy N&#8208;related triplet state and the low&#8208;energy surface oxide triplet state, which are responsible for the slow&#8208;decaying blue afterglow (453&#160;nm) and the fast&#8208;decaying green to red afterglow (513&#8211;609&#160;nm), respectively. These luminescent centers can be activated simultaneously upon CPD aggregation due to the generated rigid networks by intra/intermolecular hydrogen&#8208;band interactions. The detailed experimental characterization and theoretical calculation confirm that the red&#8208;shifted afterglow color is attributed to a gradual reduction of their energy levels with the increasing surface C&#9552;O content and aggregation degree of CPDs. Thus, these matrix&#8208;free CPDs exhibit dynamic TDTP colors over the entire visible spectrum in the solid state after turning off 365&#160;nm UV light. Based on their unusual phosphorescent properties and excellent photostability, these CPDs have been tested for various applications such as multidimensional dynamic information encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, as well as time&#8208;delayed light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs).

         <title>Deactivation Mechanism and Mitigation Strategies of Single&#8208;Atom Site Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent advances in the single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs) stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and nanoscale, and mitigation strategies by controlling the catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface. Moreover, the challenges and prospects of efficient SACs for long&#8208;term use are proposed. This review can provide a unique perspective as well as rational guidelines, with emphasis on stability/durability issues, for future large&#8208;scale applications of SACs and beyond.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom site electrocatalysts (SACs), with maximum atom efficiency, fine&#8208;tuned coordination structure, and exceptional reactivity toward catalysis, energy, and environmental purification, have become the emerging frontier in recent decade. Along with significant breakthroughs in activity and selectivity, the limited stability and durability of SACs are often underemphasized, posing a grand challenge in meeting the practical requirements. One pivotal obstacle to the construction of highly stable SACs is the heavy reliance on empirical rather than rational design methods. A comprehensive review is urgently needed to offer a concise overview of the recent progress in SACs stability/durability, encompassing both deactivation mechanism and mitigation strategies. Herein, this review first critically summarizes the SACs degradation mechanism and induction factors at the atomic&#8208;, meso&#8208; and nanoscale, mainly based on but not limited to oxygen reduction reaction. Subsequently, potential stability/durability improvement strategies by tuning catalyst composition, structure, morphology and surface are delineated, including construction of robust substrate and metal&#8208;support interaction, optimization of active site stability, fabrication of porosity and surface modification. Finally, the challenges and prospects for robust SACs are discussed. This review facilitates the fundamental understanding of catalyst degradation mechanism and provides efficient design principles aimed at overcoming deactivation difficulties for SACs and beyond.

         <title>Gambogic Acid Based Coordination Polymer Reinforces High&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound Treatment of Gynecologic Malignancies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study developed GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles&#160;(GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) that synergize with HIFU to enhance anti&#8208;tumor immunity. GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs reduce HSP&#8208;90 expression, promote dendritic cell maturation, and activate the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, amplifying immune stimulation. Combined with HIFU, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs eradicated local tumors and induced durable systemic immunity, effectively suppressing metastasis and recurrence.









Abstract
High&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) is emerging as a promising non&#8208;invasive treatment for solid tumors. Nevertheless, HIFU may also induce the upregulation of Heat Shock Protein 90 (HSP&#8208;90), potentially resulting in resistance to HIFU. Besides, although it is effective against in situ tumors, challenges remain with tumor metastasis and recurrence. Herein, the innovative design of gambogic acid (GA) based coordination polymer&#8212;GAZn&#8208;PEG nanoparticles (GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs) are synthesized through the coordination of GA with zinc ions (Zn2+), and subsequently functionalized with lipid bilayer incorporating polyethylene glycol (PEG), sensitizing HIFU for the treatment of cervical and ovarian cancers. Briefly, under HIFU exposure, GA markedly suppresses the expression of HSP&#8208;90, thereby increasing the tumor's sensitivity to HIFU therapy. Furthermore, Zn2+ not only overcome the issue of GA's poor water solubility but also synergistically stimulate immune responses in conjunction with GA. More intriguingly, it has been discovered that GAZn&#8208;PEG can effectively activate the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8208;stimulator of the interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, thereby enhancing the immune responses provoked by HIFU. Specifically, GAZn&#8208;PEG NPs show a remarkable increase in dendritic cell activation and the effective stimulation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, crucial for long&#8208;term protection against tumor recurrence and metastasis.

         <title>Enhanced Deformability Through Distributed Buckling in Stiff Quasicrystalline Architected Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quasi&#8208;periodic metamaterials combine stiffness and large&#8208;strain deformability, overcoming limitations of traditional stretching&#8208;dominated periodic designs that are prone to global buckling instabilities and catastrophic layer collapses. By leveraging non&#8208;uniform force chains, they achieve high isotropic stiffness, stable deformation, and remarkable failure resistance. Supported by numerical and experimental results, these advances open pathways for low&#8208;density applications in impact resistance and energy absorption.








Abstract
Architected materials achieve unique mechanical properties through precisely engineered microstructures that minimize material usage. However, a key challenge of low&#8208;density materials is balancing high stiffness with stable deformability up to large strains. Current microstructures, which employ slender elements such as thin beams and plates arranged in periodic patterns to optimize stiffness, are largely prone to instabilities, including buckling and brittle collapse at low strains. This challenge is here addressed by introducing a new class of aperiodic architected materials inspired by quasicrystalline lattices. Beam networks derived from canonical quasicrystalline patterns, such as the Penrose tiling in two dimensions and icosahedral quasicrystals (IQCs)&#160;in three dimensions, are shown to create stiff, stretching&#8208;dominated topologies with non&#8208;uniform force chain distributions, effectively mitigating the global instabilities observed in periodic designs through distributed localized buckling instabilities. Numerical and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of these designs in combining stiffness and stable deformability at large strains, representing a significant advancement in the development of low&#8208;density metamaterials for applications requiring high impact resistance and energy absorption. These results demonstrate the potential of deterministic quasi&#8208;periodic topologies to bridge the gap between periodic and random structures, while branching toward uncharted territory in the property space of architected&#160;materials.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-periodic metamaterials combine stiffness and large-strain deformability, overcoming limitations of traditional stretching-dominated periodic designs that are prone to global buckling instabilities and catastrophic layer collapses. By leveraging non-uniform force chains, they achieve high isotropic stiffness, stable deformation, and remarkable failure resistance. Supported by numerical and experimental results, these advances open pathways for low-density applications in impact resistance and energy absorption.

         <title>Scalable Lithium Niobate Nanoimprinting for Nonlinear Metalenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broadband polycrystalline lithium niobate platform is developed for highly versatile and scalable fabrication of nonlinear metasurfaces. This work demonstrates simultaneous second harmonic generation and wavefront&#8208;shaping via a metalens on this platform. The high effective optical nonlinearity enables broadband frequency doubled light focusing for power density enhancement from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared spectral range.








Abstract
Miniaturizing nonlinear optical components is essential for integrating advanced light manipulation into compact photonic devices, enabling scalable and cost&#8208;effective applications. While monocrystalline lithium niobate thin films advance nonlinear nanophotonics, their high inertness limits the design of top&#8208;down fabricated nanostructures. A versatile bottom&#8208;up fabrication method based on nanoimprint lithography is presented for achieving polycrystalline lithium niobate nanostructures and demonstrate its significant potential for nonlinear metasurfaces. The fabrication enables nearly vertical features and aspect ratios of up to 6 combined, which we combine with a novel solution&#8208;derived material with high effective second&#8208;order nonlinearity deff of 5&#160;pm&#160;V&#8722;1. On this platform, second&#8208;harmonic focusing is demonstrated over a broad spectral range from near&#8208;ultraviolet to near&#8208;infrared, increasing the nonlinear signal intensity by up to 34 times. This method enables the first lithium niobate metalens and expands the field of nonlinear metasurfaces by providing a low&#8208;cost, highly scalable fabrication method for engineered nonlinear&#160;nanostructures.

         <title>Intravasation&#8208;On&#8208;&#181;Device (INVADE): Engineering Dynamic Vascular Interfaces to Study Cancer Cell Intravasation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, a complex process involving cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions. INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform enables high&#8208;throughput analysis of intravasation under controlled conditions. This system reveals distinct invasion modes, an epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) &#8208; mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch, and endothelial suppression of mesenchymal traits. It also uncovers bilateral signaling, highlighting dynamic cancer&#8208;endothelial crosstalk with implications for metastasis research.

Abstract
Cancer metastasis begins with intravasation, where cancer cells enter blood vessels through complex interactions with the endothelial barrier. Understanding this process remains challenging due to the lack of physiologically relevant models. Here, INVADE (Intravasation&#8208;on&#8208;&#181;Device), a biomimetic microfluidic platform, is presented, enabling high&#8208;throughput analysis of cancer cell intravasation under controlled conditions. This engineered platform integrates 23 parallel niche chambers with an endothelialized channel, providing both precise microenvironmental control and optical accessibility for real&#8208;time visualization. Using this platform, distinct intravasation mechanisms are uncovered: MCF&#8208;7 cells exhibit collective invasion, while MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells demonstrate an interactive mode with three functionally distinct subpopulations. A previously unknown epithelial&#8208;mesenchymal transition (EMT) and mesenchymal&#8208;epithelial transition (MET) switch is We discovered during intravasation, where MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 cells initially increase Vimentin expression before undergoing a 2.3 fold decrease over 96 h alongside a 1.5 fold increase in epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM). Remarkably, endothelial cells directly suppress cancer cell mesenchymal properties, as evidenced by a 4.6 fold reduction in Vimentin expression compared to mono&#8208;cultures. Additionally, bilateral cancer&#8208;endothelial interactions are revealed, aggressive cancer cells induce significant intercellular adhesion molecule&#8208;1 (ICAM&#8208;1) upregulation in endothelium. The INVADE platform represents an engineering advancement for studying complex cell&#8211;cell interactions with implications for understanding metastatic mechanisms.

Abstract
Recently, an article by Barnes and co&#8208;workers reported an in&#8208;depth experimental re&#8208;evaluation of the earlier work on photoisomerization reactions inside optical cavities under conditions of strong light&#8208;matter coupling. That earlier work, which constituted the first demonstration of &#8216;polaritonic chemistry&#8217;, associated cavity&#8208;induced modifications of photoisomerization rates with the emergence of strong light&#8208;matter coupling (and the formation of polaritonic states). Barnes and co&#8208;workers instead found that cavity&#8208;induced changes in light absorption can account for changes in the photochemical reaction rates. While Barnes and co&#8208;workers correctly highlight the importance of controlling irradiation conditions from sample to sample where optical cavities are involved, this comment aims to emphasize the great length the original study went to ensure exactly this. The original experimental methods are summarized to point out the significant differences between them and those conducted by Barnes and co&#8208;workers. Furthermore, the importance of monochromatic photoexcitation at an isosbestic point rather than using broadband (UV through to IR) irradiation, as well as the careful control for photon flux reaching the molecular layer in all samples, as per the original work, is discussed. Further examination of important issues facing this new and developing domain of Physical Chemistry, is&#160;anticipated.

         <title>Time&#8208;Division Multiplexing Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Multicolor Phosphorescent Carbon Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label based on multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed, which leverages the variations in wavelengths and lifetimes of the phosphorescent CDs to construct time&#8208;resolved multidimensional cryptographic protocols. This study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.








Abstract
Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time&#8208;division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM&#8208;PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time&#8208;resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi&#8208;color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non&#8208;radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time&#8208;resolved anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non&#8208;overlapping multicolor and multi&#8208;time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time&#8208;division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti&#8208;counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting strategies.

&lt;p&gt;Phosphorescent materials offer a promising approach to information encryption due to their long luminescence lifetimes and high signal-to-noise ratios. However, fixed phosphorescent patterns are vulnerable to imitation over time, limiting their effectiveness in advanced encryption. Here, a time-division multiplexing physical unclonable function (TDM-PUF) label utilizing multicolor phosphorescent carbon dots (CDs) is proposed that leverages variations in wavelength and lifetime to construct time-resolved, multidimensional cryptographic protocols. Efficient multi-color phosphorescence in CDs is achieved by enhancing intersystem crossing, suppressing non-radiative transitions through confinement effects, and regulating emission spectra via energy transfer. The random spatial distribution and unpredictable emissions of phosphorescent CDs significantly enhance the complexity of the PUF system, thereby fortifying its defenses against mimicry attacks. Furthermore, this PUF system exhibits multiple optical responses over time, allowing correct information recognition only at specified time nodes, achieving time-resolved anti-counterfeiting. Finally, by segmenting PUF labels based on emission color and time channels, non-overlapping multicolor and multi-time segments are achieved, enabling highly secure time-division multiplexed encryption. The study provides a competitive anti-counterfeiting label and inspires the development of novel anti-counterfeiting strategies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoscale Inhomogeneity and Epitaxial Strain Control Metallicity in Single Crystalline Thin Films of High Entropy Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Understanding the complex interplay between local structure and physical properties is a key challenge in high entropy oxide (HEO) research, particularly concerning electronic transport. This work demonstrates the profound influence of local chemical inhomogeneity and underlying epitaxial strain on the electronic transport properties of HEO thin film with perovskite structure, paving pathways to tailor electronic properties in high&#8208;entropy regime.








Abstract
Understanding the electronic transport properties of thin films of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO), having multiple elements at the same crystallographic site, is crucial for their potential electronic applications. However, very little is known about the metallic phase of HEOs even in bulk form. This work delves into the interplay between global and local structural distortion and electronic properties of single crystalline thin films of (La0.2Pr0.2Nd0.2Sm0.2Eu0.2)NiO3, which exhibit metal&#8208;insulator transition under tensile strain. Employing electron microscopy and elemental resolved electron energy loss spectroscopy, we provide direct evidence of nanoscale chemical inhomogeneities at the rare&#8208;earth site, leading to a broad distribution of Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles. However, the octahedral rotation pattern remains the same throughout. The metallic phase consists of insulating patches with more distorted Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond angles, responsible for higher resistance exponents with increased compositional complexity. Moreover, a rare, fully metallic state of HEO thin film is achieved under compressive strain. We further demonstrate a direct correlation between the suppression of the insulating behavior and increased electronic hopping. Our findings provide a foundation for exploring Mott&#8208;Anderson electron localization physics in the high&#8208;entropy&#160;regime.

         <title>A Core&#8208;Shell Perovskite Composite Air Electrode With Thermal&#8208;Expansion Offset and Mechanical Support Functions for Highly Durable Reversible Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8208;shell perovskite composite with a highly durable electrochemical activity for oxygen catalysis is developed as an air electrode for reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) via a unique solid&#8208;state reaction. This work also demonstrates a new pathway to developing highly durable air electrode materials for RPCCs technology, accelerating RPCCs&#8217; commercialization.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic cells (RPCCs) offer a promising pathway to efficient and reversible energy conversion, accelerating the global shift to renewables. However, the RPCCs&#8217; commercialization faces limitations in air electrode materials. Traditional cobalt&#8208;based perovskite air electrodes, while effective, suffer from high cost and environmental concerns. Alternative materials, such as SrFeO3&#8208;&#948; (SF)&#8208;based perovskites, offer potential, yet durability issues, including thermal&#8208;expansion mismatch and mechanical instability, hinder their practical application. Here, a unique solid&#8208;state reaction between SF and negative&#8208;thermal&#8208;expansion (NTE) material is demonstrated to yield a core&#8208;shell perovskite composite as a highly durable RPCCs air electrode. Specifically, by calcining a mixture of SF and an NTE material, ZrW2O8 (ZWO), the in situ incorporation of ZWO into the SF lattice is achieved, resulting in a non&#8208;closed core&#8208;shell composite, comprising single perovskite SraFebZrcWdO3&#8208;&#948; (SP&#8208;SFZW) core and B&#8208;site cation ordered double perovskite SrxFeyZrmWnO6&#8208;&#948; (DP&#8208;SFZW) shell. Both SP&#8208;SFZW and DP&#8208;SFZW serve as oxygen catalysts, while DP&#8208;SFZW shell additionally acts as a thermal expansion suppressor and mechanical support structure, effectively mitigating electrode cracking and delamination from other cell components during RPCC operation. Consequently, the composite electrode demonstrates comparable catalytic activity to SF, coupled with significantly enhanced durability. This work illustrates a novel approach for developing robust RPCCs air electrode.

         <title>Interstitial&#8208;Substitutional&#8208;Mixed Solid Solution of RuO2 Nurturing a New Pathway Beyond the Activity&#8208;Stability Linear Constraint in Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism is proposed in RuO2 by constructing an interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), in which the interstitial C as the proton acceptor decreases the deprotonation energy barrier, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor weakens the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency, thereby breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER.








Abstract
The acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts for proton exchange membrane electrolyzer (PEMWE) often face a trade&#8208;off between activity and stability due to inherent linear relationship and overoxidation of metal atoms in highly oxidative environments, while following the conventional adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM). Herein, a favorable AEM&#8208;derived proton acceptor&#8208;electron donor mechanism (PAEDM) is proposed in RuO2 by constructing interstitial&#8208;substitutional mixed solid solution structure (denoted as C,Ta&#8208;RuO2), which can effectively break the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off of RuO2 in acidic OER. In situ spectroscopy experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the interstitial C as the proton acceptor reduces the deprotonation energy barrier, enhancing catalytic activity, while the substitutional Ta as the electron donor donates electrons to the Ru sites via bridging oxygen, weakening the Ru&#9472;O bond covalency and preventing over&#8208;oxidation of surface Ru, thereby ensuring long&#8208;term stability. Under the guidance of this mechanism, the optimized C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 simultaneously achieves far low overpotential (&#951;10 = 171&#160;mV) and ultra&#8208;long stability (over 1300&#160;h) for the acidic OER. More remarkably, a homemade PEMWE using C,Ta&#8208;RuO2 as the anode also shows high water splitting performance (1.63&#160;V@1 A cm&#8722;2). This work supplies a novel strategy to guide future developments on efficient OER electrocatalysts toward water oxidation.

Breaking Quantum Confinement in Yb3&#8314;&#8208;Doped ZnSe QDs: Surface&#8208;energy engineering enables scalable growth beyond the exciton Bohr radius with high&#8208;purity blue emission (453 nm), narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46 nm, and exceptional photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. 








Abstract
Large ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) with an emission peak &#8776;450&#160;nm hold significant promise for display technologies. However, achieving efficient pure&#8208;blue emission through the enlargement of ZnSe nanocrystals remains a significant challenge. In this study, a breakthrough is reported in growing large&#8208;size ZnSe QDs well beyond the exciton Bohr radius through Yb3+ doping strategy. Yb3+ doping reduces the surface energy of the ZnSe (220) crystal plane and alleviates interface strain in the ZnSe/ZnS structure, enabling the QDs to grow larger while maintaining enhanced crystal stability. The resulting Yb: ZnSe/ZnS QDs exhibit pure&#8208;blue emission at 453&#160;nm, with a full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 46&#160;nm and a high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 67.5%. When integrated into quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), the devices display electroluminescence (EL) at 455&#160;nm, with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 1.35%, and a maximum luminance of 1337.08&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>A Microgel&#8211;Hydrogel Hybrid for Functional Compensation and Mechanical Stability in 3D Printed Cell&#8208;Dense Vascularized Liver Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed&#160;to construct a multiscale vascular network through embedded bioprinting and guided vascular morphogenesis. With a high density of hepatocytes, a bioengineered thick vascularized liver tissue model achieves a rapid and&#160;promising functional compensation in rats with 85% hepatectomy via direct vascular integration, providing a theraputi paradigm for physiological&#8208;related engineered tissue in animals with acute disease.








Abstract
3D bioprinting of liver tissue with high cell density (HCD) shows great promise for restoring function in cases of acute liver failure, where a substantial number of functional cells are required to perform essential physiological tasks. Direct vascular anastomosis is critical for the successful implantation of these bioprinted vascularized tissues into the host vasculature, allowing for rapid functional compensation and addressing various acute conditions. However, conventional hydrogels used to encapsulate high&#8208;density cells often lack the mechanical properties needed to withstand the shear forces of physiological blood flow, often resulting in implantation failure. In this study, a heterogeneous microgel&#8211;hydrogel hybrid is developed to carry HCD hepatocytes and support the embedded bioprinting of hierarchical vascular structures. By optimizing the ratio of microgel to biomacromolecule, the covalently crosslinked network offers mechanical integrity and enables&#160;direct vascular anastomosis, ensuring efficient nutrient and oxygen exchange. The bioprinted thick, vascularized constructs, containing HCD hepatocytes, are successfully implanted in rats after 85% hepatectomy, leading to swift functional recovery and prolonged survival. This study presents a strategy to enhance regenerative therapy outcomes through advanced bioprinting and vascular integration techniques.

         <title>In Situ Impurity Phase Repair Strategy Enables Highly&#8208;Efficient Perovskite Solar Cells with Periodic Photovoltaic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite, ideal for high&#8208;efficiency solar cells, suffers from impurity phases causing defects and instability. Using FAI/MASCN vapors repairs impurities into &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhancing charge transport and morphology. This achieves 26.05% efficiency, with large&#8208;area devices (24.52% for 1 cm2, 22.35% for 17.1 cm2). Cyclic repair retains 94.3% efficiency after two cycles, significantly boosting device durability.








Abstract
The photoactive &#945;&#8208;phase of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite (&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3) is regarded as one of the ideal materials for high&#8208;efficiency perovskite solar cells (PSCs) due to its superior optoelectronic properties. However, during the deposition of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films, the presence of impurity phases, such as PbI2 and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3, can cause the formation of inherent defects, which leads to suboptimal charge transport and extraction properties, as well as inadequate long&#8208;term stability in the film's morphology and structure. To address these issues, an impurity phase repair strategy is employed using FAI/MASCN mixed vapors to convert the impurity phases into light&#8208;absorbing &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3. Meanwhile, this recrystallization process also facilitates the recovery of its characteristic morphology, thereby improving efficiency and enhancing the durability of PSCs. This approach promotes the PSCs to obtain an efficiency of 26.05% (with a certified efficiency of 25.67%, and steady&#8208;state PCE of 25.41%). Additionally, this approach is suitable for the fabrication of large&#8208;area devices, obtaining a 1 cm2 device with a PCE of 24.52% and a mini&#8208;module (with an area of 17.1 cm2) with a PCE of 22.35%. Furthermore, it is found that this strategy enables cyclic repair of aged perovskite films, with the perovskite solar cells retaining &#8776; 94.3% of their initial efficiency after two cycles of repair, significantly enhancing the lifetime of the perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Constructing Controlled Vertical Gradient Morphology in Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics via Self&#8208;Assembled Interface Orthogonal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy is first applied to construct pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics with controllable vertical gradient distribution morphology. Introducing low surface&#8208;energy N2200 to self&#8208;assemble molecular layer on PM6 surface overcomes erosion effect and modulates phase morphology, thus achieving the highest efficiency of 19.86% via air&#8208;printing process.








Abstract
Precisely regulating vertically distributed morphology by blade&#8208;coating process is crucial to realize high&#8208;performance large&#8208;scale pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction organic photovoltaics (OPVs). However, the thermodynamic motion and random diffusion of donor/acceptor (D/A) generated from the differences in surface energy and concentration during sequentially blade&#8208;coating process will cause great challenges for obtaining ideal active layer morphology. Herein, this study have proposed a self&#8208;assembled interface orthogonal strategy by introducing low surface energy guest (N2200) to form protective layer on PM6 surface, which counteracts erosion from orthogonal solution of acceptor to enhance continuity of D/A phases, thus promoting directional carrier migration and effectively suppressing energetic disorder. Finally, N2200&#8208;modified device achieves the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.86%, and large&#8208;area module (16.94 cm2) exhibits exceptional PCE (16.43%). This investigation presents innovative insights into morphology issue triggered by molecular motion and provides an effective method for air&#8208;printing large&#8208;scale OPVs with precisely controlled morphology based on non&#8208;halogenated solvent.

         <title>Accurate Thermal Resection of Atomically Precise Copper Clusters to Achieve Near&#8208;IR Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster Cu8SN is synthesized by using a strong anchoring ability protective ligand (2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine) and a relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligand. Then, a precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to only peel the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8SN cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster (Cu8SN&#8211;T). Cu8SN&#8211;T exhibits greatly enhanced light&#8208;harvesting abilities and full&#8208;spectrum responsive overall CO2 photoreduction with &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity.









Abstract
Atomically precise copper clusters are desirable as catalysts for elaborating the structure&#8211;activity relationships. The challenge, however, lies in their tendency to sinter when protective ligands are removed, resulting in the destruction of the structural integrity of the model system. Herein, a copper&#8208;sulfur&#8208;nitrogen cluster [Cu8(StBu)4(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN) is synthesized by using a mixed ligand approach with strong chelating 2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (PymSH) ligands and relatively weak monodentate tert&#8208;butyl mercaptan ligands. A precise thermal&#8208;resection strategy is applied to selectively peel only the targeted weak ligands off, which induces a structural transformation of the initial Cu8 cluster into a new and more stable Cu&#8211;S&#8211;N cluster [Cu8(S)2(PymS)4] (denoted as Cu8SN&#8208;T). The residual bridging S2&#8722; within the metal core forms asymmetric Cu&#8208;S species with a near&#8208;infrared (NIR) response, which endows Cu8SN&#8208;T with the capability for full&#8208;spectrum responsive CO2 photoreduction, achieving a &#8776;100% CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO selectivity. Especially for NIR&#8208;driven CO2 reduction, it has a CO evolution of 42.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 under &#955; &gt; 780 nm. Importantly, this work represents the first NIR light&#8208;responsive copper cluster for efficient CO2 photoreduction and opens an avenue for the precise manipulation of metal cluster structures via a novel thermolysis strategy to develop unprecedented functionalized metal cluster materials.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Solar Cells via a Multifunctional Crystallization Regulating Passivation Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic compound is introduced into perovskite solar cells to regulate perovskite crystallization, passivate various defects, and enhance hole transport at the HTL/perovskite interface. This approach achieved high efficiencies of 25.04% for 1 cm2 cells and 22.81% for 12 cm2 modules, with excellent stability (maintaining 80% of initial efficiency after 2500 h of MPP tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standards).








Abstract
Film morphology and surface/interface defect density play a critical role in determining the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, a chlorine&#8208;substituted aromatic polycyclic derivative (BNCl) is reported, which shows strong interaction with both lead iodide and dimethyl sulfoxide, to regulate the crystallization of perovskite, along with effective passivation of grain boundaries and surface. In addition, the extruded BNCl molecule at the hole transport layer (HTL)/perovskite interface can facilitate the hole transport, leading to better charge transfer. As a result, certified power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.04% and 22.81% are achieved for PSCs and minimodules with aperture areas of 1 cm2 and 12 cm2 respectively. In addition, the device maintained 80% of its initial efficiency after 2500 h of maximum power point (MPP) tracking under ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1 standard.

Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices
Machine Learning designs new nanolattice geometries with the strength of carbon steel, but the density of Styrofoam, offering record strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight of lightweight materials. By implementing multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization in combination with two&#8208;photon polymerization and pyrolysis, these ultrahigh specific strength carbon nanolattices more than double the performance of benchmark materials. More details can be found in article number 2410651 by Peter Serles, Tobin Filleter, Seunghwa Ryu, and co&#8208;workers.

True Random Number Generator
In article number 2419579, Hocheon Yoo and co&#8208;workers present arc discharge light&#8208;induced true random number generator (ALTRNG), using a bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector to generate random bits through unpredictable arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams and, with a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, enables wireless random number transmission for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Rational Design of Methylated Triazine&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Water (Adv. Mater. 14/2025)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CO2 Photoreduction
A novel family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers, which is capable of mimicking natural leaves for efficient CO2 photoreduction with only H2O vapor, has been developed through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine&#8208;type monomers and acetic anhydride for the first time, opening&#8208;up new possibilities in the development of new polymeric semiconductors for artificial photocatalysis.

         <title>Ultrahigh Specific Strength by Bayesian Optimization of Carbon Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization algorithm designs high&#8208;strength nanolattices made of pyrolytic carbon which offer the compressive strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam. This study combines machine learning with nanoscale strengthening and nanoscale 3D printing to achieve unattained material properties with millimeter scalability for light&#8208;weight high&#8208;strength materials.








Abstract
Nanoarchitected materials are at the frontier of metamaterial design and have set the benchmark for mechanical performance in several contemporary applications. However, traditional nanoarchitected designs with conventional topologies exhibit poor stress distributions and induce premature nodal failure. Here, using multi&#8208;objective Bayesian optimization and two&#8208;photon polymerization, optimized carbon nanolattices with an exceptional specific strength of 2.03&#160;MPa&#160;m3&#160;kg&#8722;1 at low densities &lt;215&#160;kg m&#8722;3 are created. Generative design optimization provides experimental improvements in strength and Young's modulus by as much as 118% and 68%, respectively, at equivalent densities with entirely different lattice failure responses. Additionally, the reduction of nanolattice strut diameters to 300&#160;nm produces a unique high&#8208;strength carbon with a pyrolysis&#8208;induced atomic gradient of 94% sp2 aromatic carbon and low oxygen impurities. Using multi&#8208;focus multi&#8208;photon polymerization, a millimeter&#8208;scalable metamaterial consisting of 18.75 million lattice cells with nanometer dimensions is demonstrated. Combining Bayesian optimized designs and nanoarchitected pyrolyzed carbon, the optimal nanostructures exhibit the strength of carbon steel at the density of Styrofoam offering unparalleled capabilities in light&#8208;weighting, fuel reduction, and contemporary design applications.

         <title>Engineered Neutrophil Nanovesicles for Inhibiting Corneal Neovascularization by Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammatory, Anti&#8208;VEGF, and Chemoexcited Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop for cornea neovascularization treatment has been developed. The nanovesicle inherits the chemotactic and anti&#8208;inflammatory capabilities of the neutrophils and acts as a drug carrier. By incorporating ranibizumab on its surface and loading photosensitizers into the phospholipid bilayer of the membrane, a synergistic and complementary treatment of cornea neovascularization is achieved by anti&#8208;inflammation, anti&#8208;VEGF, and PDT therapy.








Abstract
Corneal neovascularization (CorNV) develops under various pathological conditions and is one of the main causes of blindness. Due to that CorNV progression involves multiple steps, anti&#8208;vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) drugs alone could not sufficiently suppress this process, highlighting an urgent need for an efficient delivery system for the multi&#8208;step management of CorNV. In this study, a neutrophil nanovesicle&#8208;based eye drop (NCCR) is developed for CorNV therapy that simultaneously inhibits angiogenesis and inflammation, while eliminating pathological cells through chemoexcited photodynamic therapy (PDT). NCCR targets inflammatory lesions by leveraging the expression of chemokine receptors from the source cells. Then, NCCR exerts inhibitory effects on the sequential steps of neovascularization. First, it acts as a decoy and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect by neutralizing cytokines via its receptors on the surface of nanovesicles. Second, thioketals bond&#8208;linked ranibizumab is released in the high reactive oxygen species microenvironment of CorNV sites to bind VEGF, inhibiting vascular endothelial cell activation and proliferation. Finally, chemoexcited PDT eliminates preformed corneal blood vessels, disrupting tube formation and pericyte recruitment. The synergistic effects of NCCR on angiogenesis and inflammation, combined with the induction of apoptosis in neovessels via chemoexcited PDT, offer a novel and efficient strategy for CorNV treatment.

         <dc:description>
A photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) based on highly anisotropic organic crystals is developed for bionic night&#8208;time polarization perception. Ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of &gt;105 is achieved through time accumulation under ultraweak light of 200 nW&#160;cm&#8722;2. High&#8208;contrast polarization imaging is realized in artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles.

The emerging semiconductor micro/nanocrystals with intrinsic anisotropy have provided new perspectives for low&#8208;cost and simplified polarimetry. However, the low polarization sensitivity of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarimeters based on anisotropic semiconductors under weak and partially polarized light severely hinders their practical application in complex dim environments. Here, a photo&#8208;adaptive polarization&#8208;sensitive organic phototransistor (POL&#8208;OPT) is demonstrated for bionic weak&#8208;light polarization perception. The combination of highly anisotropic organic crystals with charge&#8208;storage accumulative effect enables a self&#8208;adaptive polarized photoresponse of the phototransistor to imitate the bionic scotopic adaptation process. Consequently, an ultrahigh dichroic ratio (DR) of over 105 is achieved through time accumulation under an ultraweak light intensity of 200 nW cm&#8722;2, which is among the highest in polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. Furthermore, POL&#8208;OPT array is constructed for effective polarization perception in an artificial moonlit environment with a low degree of linear polarization (DoLP) down to 0.26, reaching the detection threshold of night&#8208;active dung beetles. This study offers a new opportunity for the development of new&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance polarimeters for polarization imaging, bionic navigation, and artificial visual systems.

         <title>Engineered Stem Cell Booster Breaks&#160;Pathological Barriers to Treat Chronic Pancreatitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), two main pathological barriers are encountered: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based nitric oxide system is constructed to regulate collagen fibers and enhance therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, showing the synergetic effect and successfully breaking two pathological barriers.








Abstract
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a long&#8208;standing progressive fibrosis and has long been considered incurable, which remains a heavy health burden worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with anti&#8208;fibrosis properties are currently used in the treatment of fibroinflammatory diseases. However, its therapeutic effect is limited mainly due to two main types of pathological barriers in CP: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivery system (MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO) is constructed. In the MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO, NO not only can be a cell booster to regulate collagen fibers, relieve the vascular compression and enhance the accumulation of MSCs in the whole pancreas, but also can form a protective gas layer on the cell surface, which enhances the therapeutic effect of MSCs. In the CP rat model, the pancreatic injury and fibrosis are reduced with 7 days after a single dose administration of this long&#8208;acting MSCs. Collectively, this study offers a promising strategy for enhancing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs to break pathological barriers in CP treatment.

         <title>Deep Learning Analysis of Localized Interlayer Stacking Displacement and Dynamics in Bilayer Phosphorene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interlayer displacement plays a crucial role in tuning properties of layered crystals, yet its precise and efficient determination remains challenging. A deep learning&#8208;based analysis is presented for atomic&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, accurately identifying stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene with near unit&#8208;cell resolution. The model processes large&#8208;scale in situ TEM data, capturing time&#8208;dependent displacement dynamics linked to edge reconstruction.








Abstract
The interlayer displacement has recently emerged as a crucial tuning parameter to control diverse physical properties in layered crystals. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), an exceptionally powerful tool for structural analysis, directly observes the interlayer stacking and strain fields in various crystals. However, conventional analysis methods based on high&#8208;resolution phase&#8208;contrast TEM images are inadequate for recognizing spatially varying unit&#8208;cell patterns and their associated structure factors, hindering precise determination of interlayer displacements. Here, a deep learning&#8208;based analysis is introduced for atomic resolution TEM images, enabling unit&#8208;cell pattern recognition and precise identification of interlayer stacking displacement in bilayer phosphorene. The deep learning model applied to bilayer phosphorene accurately determines stacking displacement, with an error level of 3.3% displacement within the unit cell and a spatial resolution approaching the individual unit&#8208;cell level. Additionally, the model successfully processes a large set of in situ TEM data, capturing spatially varying, time&#8208;dependent interlayer displacement dynamics associated with edge reconstruction, demonstrating its potential for processing large&#8208;scale microscopy datasets.

         <title>Hole&#8208;selective Transparent In Situ Passivation Contacts for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Graded Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces an in situ internal encapsulation strategy by integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into the antisolvent to construct a highly hole&#8208;selective, transparent, and robust passivation contact. The 1.65 eV n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSC achieves a 19.8% PCE, with better thermal, UV, and operational stabilities, and a bifaciality of 101.4%, alongside a 29.2% certified PCE tandem cell.








Abstract
The optically deficient and intrinsically unstable hole transport layer (HTL) is the Achilles&#8217; heel of n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. Here, a minimalist transparent hole&#8208;selective contact is developed without additional HTL by simply integrating cross&#8208;linkable p&#8208;type small molecules into antisolvent. This strategy not only improves the perovskite crystallinity, shields the perovskite from external stressors, and suppresses interfacial mass exchange, but also provides efficient defect passivation and favorable band alignment via the formation of graded heterojunction. Consequently, the corresponding 1.65 eV perovskite solar cell achieves a stabilized efficiency of 19.6%, alongside significantly improved thermal, ultraviolet, and operation stabilities. Furthermore, leveraging its outstanding transparency, a bifacial single&#8208;junction device is showcased achieving a record bifaciality of 101.4%, and a monolithic perovskite/silicon tandem boasting a certified efficiency of 29.2% for 1.04 cm2, which represents the highest certified efficiency achieved for n&#8211;i&#8211;p perovskite/silicon tandems. The demonstration of efficient and stable minimalist hole&#8208;selective contacts encourages the tandem community to reevaluate the n&#8211;i&#8211;p structure, with the goal of harnessing the high open&#8208;circuit voltage of single&#8208;junction n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs.

         <title>An Electron Transfer Mediated Mechanism for Efficient Photoreforming of Waste Plastics Using a Ni3S4/ZnCdS Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is prepared for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. The catalyst exhibits high H2 production rates of 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with selectivities of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from PLA and PET, respectively.








Abstract
The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H2) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer&#8208;mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni3S4 extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H2 production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS&#160;surface, favoring hole&#8208;dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H2 production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H2 fuel and high&#8208;selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of &#8220;White Pollution&#8221;.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and high-selectivity value-added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer-mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS&#160;surface, favoring hole-dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fuel and high-selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of &#8220;&lt;i&gt;White Pollution&lt;/i&gt;&#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Win&#8211;Win Integration of Genetically Engineered Cellular Nanovesicles with High&#8208;Absorbing Multimodal Phototheranostic Molecules for Boosted Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergistic approach utilizing genetically engineered cancer cellular nanovesicles displaying PD&#8208;1 ligands as both tumor&#8208;targeted nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents, combined with high&#8208;absorbing multimodal AIEgens as phototheranostic module is developed to implement NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging while simultaneously improve the efficacy of photo&#8208;immunotherapy for both primary and distant metastatic tumors.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non&#8208;specific distribution and the subsequent immune&#8208;related adverse events. Meanwhile, high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light&#8208;harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win&#8211;win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high&#8208;powered photo&#8208;immunotherapy systems. Specifically, the phototheranostic agent (AOTTIT) displaying typical aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence extending to the second near&#8208;infrared II window, as well as outstanding reactive oxygen species and heat production capacity is first obtained via ingenious design. Notably, AOTTIT exhibits a record high molar extinction coefficient among the reported organic multimodal phototheranostic molecules. Meanwhile, PD&#8208;1 genetically engineered cancer cell membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles (PD&#8208;1/CMNVs) are prepared as both nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents to camouflage AOTTIT nanoparticles, yielding a multifunctional photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agent (CMNPs/PD&#8208;1) with tumor&#8208;specific active and homologous targeting ability. The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win&#8208;win strategy.

         <title>Arylamine&#8208;Linked Porous Organic Polymers with Abundant Redox&#8208;Active Sites as High&#8208;Capacity and High&#8208;Rate Organic Cathodes for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar porous organic polymers (POPs) are designed and prepared as organic cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Benefiting from their high&#8208;density redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high&#8208;capacity, high&#8208;rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability as organic cathode materials for LIBs.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;active porous organic polymers (POPs) have emerged as promising and sustainable organic cathode materials (OCMs) for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). However, their performance is significantly limited by insufficient redox&#8208;active sites and low intrinsic conductivity. Herein, a series of novel arylamine&#8208;linked and bipolar POPs (denoted as HATN&#8208;AQ, HATN&#8208;BQ, HATN&#8208;CBD, and HATN&#8208;PTO) are designed and prepared as OCMs for LIBs. Benefiting from their high density of redox&#8208;active sites, bipolar feature, and arylamine linkage, these POPs exhibited high capacity, high rate, and excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability. Among them, HATN&#8208;PTO displayed an ultrahigh reversible capacity of 329.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 with a high energy density of 716.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, outstanding rate performance (208.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), and superior cycling stability (188.9 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity retained after 500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1). Furthermore, the HATN&#8208;PTO//graphite full battery exhibited a high specific capacity of 227.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 and maintained a high capacity of 99.1 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1. Ex situ FT&#8208;IR and XPS spectra combined with theoretical calculations are employed to elucidate the dual&#8208;ion storage mechanism. This work provides an effective strategy for designing POPs with high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;rate for OCMs.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Reinforcing Ether Coordination of Localized High Concentration Electrolyte Enables High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

A robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of Pyr13TFSI as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics.








Abstract
The decomposition of 1,2&#8208;dimethoxyethane (DME) in localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCEs) under high voltage produces fragile and unstable organic fragments at the cathode/electrolyte interphase, which greatly damages the cycling performance of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium metal batteries. Herein, a robust strategy is proposed by adding ionic liquid of 1&#8208;Methyl&#8208;1&#8208;propyl pyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Pyr13TFSI) as co&#8208;solvent into the bulk electrolyte to significantly improve the stability of solvated DME through reinforcing the ion&#8208;dipole interaction between TFSI&#8722; and DME. The Pyr13TFSI can balance the interaction among the electrolyte components to reduce the dynamic de&#8208;coordinated DME molecules and promote the formation of anion&#8208;derived cathode electrolyte interphase with excellent electrochemical stability and high Li+ transport dynamics. The Li||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 coin cells with Pyr13TFSI exhibit capacity retention of 76.1% after 1800 cycles at 1&#160;C rate (4.5 V), and 77.1% after 800 cycles at a high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V. Furthermore, the cells using Li anode with the thickness of 50 &#181;m and high LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 loading of 18.68 mg cm&#8722;2 can operate for 175 cycles with high&#8208;capacity retention of 73.35%. This work demonstrates that modulating the interactions among electrolyte components using ionic liquid can optimize the coordination chemistry for advanced high&#8208;energy density Li metal batteries.

2D polymeric C60 is an emerging all&#8208;carbon semiconductor possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. A hydrogen&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy has been developed to produce gram&#8208;scale large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). The thin&#8208;film photodetectors demonstrate broad spectral response from visible light to near&#8208;infrared region.








Abstract
2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C60 nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time&#8208;consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H+) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium (TBA+), ensuring gram&#8208;scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C60. As a proof of concept, the solution&#8208;processed 2D polymeric C60 nanosheets have been integrated into thin&#8208;film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C60.

         <title>Mechanosensitive and pH&#8208;Gated Butterfly&#8208;Shaped Artificial Ion Channel for High&#8208;Selective K+ Transport and Cancer Cell Apoptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural ion channels, this research presents a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped bionic K+ transmembrane channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) with record&#8208;breaking K+/Na+ selectivity. The unique mobile channels constructed from poly (propylene imine) dendritic polymers and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers exhibit dual mechanical and pH responsiveness in liposomes/cells. Drastic G4C7&#8208;induced intracellular K+ efflux effectively activates mitochondrial&#8208; and ER&#8208;associated apoptosis.








Abstract
To advance the exploration of mechanisms underlying natural multi&#8208;gated ion channels, a novel butterfly&#8208;shaped biomimetic K+ channel GnC7 (n = 3, 4) is developed with dual mechanical and pH responsiveness, exhibiting unprecedented K+/Na+ selectivity (G3C7: 34.4; G4C7: 41.3). These channels constructed from poly(propylene imine) dendrimer and benzo&#8208;21&#8208;crown&#8208;7&#8208;ethers achieve high K+ transport activity (EC50: 0.72 &#181;m for G3C7; 0.9 &#181;m for G4C7) due to their arc&#8208;like mechanical rotation. The dynamic mode relies on butterfly&#8208;shaped topology derived from the highly symmetrical core and multiple intramolecular hydrogen bonds. GnC7 can sense mechanical stimulus applied to liposomes/cells and then adapt the K+ transport rate accordingly. Furthermore, reversible ON/OFF switching of K+ transport is realized through the pH&#8208;controllable host&#8208;guest complexation. G4C7&#8208;induced ultrafast cellular K+ efflux (70% within only 9 min) efficiently triggers mitochondrial&#8208;dependent apoptosis of cancer cells by provoking endoplasmic reticulum stress accompanied by drastic Ca2+ sparks. This work embodies a multi&#8208;dimensional regulation of channel functions; it will provide insights into the dynamic behaviors of biological analogs and promote the innovative design of artificial ion channels and therapeutic agents.

         <title>Abnormal Slow Phonon Dynamics Toward Prolonging Excited States Dynamics Enabled by Crystalline&#8208;Assembling Donor&#8211;Acceptor Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline&#8208;packing donor&#8211;acceptor molecular structures into dipolar crystals enables slow phonon dynamics from lattice vibrations when optical phonons develop mutual&#8208;opposite phase relations. Through electron&#8211;phonon coupling, slow phonon dynamics interact with light&#8208;emitting singlet charge&#8208;transfer states containing contribution from triplets through triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet intersystem crossing, consequently leading to extended excited states dynamics with prolonged PL lifetime shown as super&#8208;delayed fluorescence in dipolar organic crystals.








Abstract
Phonon dynamics are a critical factor to control the optical properties of excited states in light&#8208;emitting materials. Here, we report an extremely slow relaxation of photoexcited lattice vibrations enabled by assembling the donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8211;A) molecules [2&#8208;(9,9&#8208;dimethylacridin&#8208;10(9H)&#8208;yl)&#8208;9,9&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;thioxanthene 10,10&#8208;dioxide], namely AC molecules, into dipolar crystal. By using photoexcitation&#8208;modulated Raman spectroscopy, we find that the crystalline&#8208;lattice vibrations monitored by Raman&#8208;scattering laser beam of 785&#160;nm demonstrate an un&#8208;usual slow relaxation in the time scale of seconds after ceasing photoexcitation beam of 343&#160;nm in such dipolar crystal. This presents extremely slow phonon dynamics enabled by crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into a dipolar crystal. Simultaneously, the photoluminescence (PL) exhibits a prolonged behavior, lasting 10&#160;ms after ceasing photoexcitation in dipolar AC crystal. This phenomenon provides an experimental hypothesis that the slow phonon dynamics function as an important mechanism to unusually prolong excited states dynamics upon crystalline&#8208;assembling the D&#8211;A molecules into dipolar crystal. This hypothesis can be verified by directly suppressing the phonon dynamics through freezing D&#8211;A molecular liquid into dipolar crystalline solid at 77 K to largely prolong the PL to 1 s&#8208; after removing photoexcitation. Clearly, crystalline&#8208;assembling D&#8211;A molecules provide the necessary conditions to enable slow phonon dynamics toward prolonging excited states dynamics.

         <title>Rational Design of Methylated Triazine&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction with Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is developed for successful photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. The key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks.








Abstract
The development of semiconducting conjugated polymers for photoredox catalysis holds great promise for sustainable utilization of solar energy. Herein a new family of porous methylated triazine&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers is reported that enable efficient photoreduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) with water (H2O) vapor, in the absence of any additional photosensitizer, sacrificial agents or cocatalysts. It is demonstrated that the key lies in the generation of methylated triazine linkages through a facile condensation reaction between benzamidine and acetic anhydride, which impedes the formation of conventional triazine&#8208;based frameworks. It is also shown that regulating conjugated linear backbones with different lengths of electron&#8208;donated benzyl units provides a facile means to modulate their optical properties and the exciton dissociation, thereby affording more long&#8208;lived photogenerated charge carriers and boosting charge separation and transfer. A high&#8208;performance carbon monoxide (CO) production rate of 218.9 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved with &#8776; 100% CO selectivity, which is accompanied by exceptional H2O oxidation to oxygen (O2). It anticipates this new study will advance synthetic approaches toward polymeric semiconductors and facilitate new possibilities for triazine&#8208;based conjugated polymers with promising potential in artificial photocatalysis.

         <title>Pillared Laminar Vermiculite Membranes with Tunable Monovalent and Multivalent Ion Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alumina pillared vermiculite membrane is fabricated with a laminar structure. Enhanced water stability is observed due to the strengthened interlamellar binding. Through cation doping, the surface charge and pore size of the pillared laminar membrane are tuned, demonstrating highly selective and tunable ion sieving performance promising for water treatment and resource recovery applications.








Abstract
Effective membrane separation of Li+ from Na+ and Mg2+ is crucial for lithium extraction from water yet challenging for conventional polymeric membranes. Two dimensional (2D)&#160;membranes with ordered laminar structures and tunable physicochemical properties offer distinctive ion&#8208;sieving capabilities promising for lithium extraction. Recently, phyllosilicates are introduced as abundant and cost&#8208;effective source materials for such membranes. However, their water instability and low inherent ion transport selectivity hinder practical applications. Herein, a new class of laminar membranes with excellent stability and tunable ion sieving is reported by incorporating inorganic alumina pillars into vermiculite interlayers. Crosslinking vermiculite flakes with alumina pillars significantly strengthens interlamellar interactions, resulting in robust water stability. Doping of Na+ before the pillaring process reverses the membrane's surface charge, substantially boosting Li+ separation from multivalent cations via electrostatic interactions. Lithium extraction is often complicated by the presence of co&#8208;existing monovalent cations (e.g., Na+) at higher concentrations. Here, by introducing excess Na+ into the membrane after the pillaring process, the separation of Li+ from monovalent cations is enhanced through steric effects. This work realizes both monovalent/multivalent and monovalent/monovalent selective ion sieving with the same membrane platform. A separation mechanism is proposed based on Donnan exclusion and size exclusion, providing new insights for membrane design for resource recovery applications.

         <title>Red Phosphorescence at Elevated Temperatures Enabled by Dexter Energy Transfer in Polyaromatic Hydrocarbon&#8208;Xanthone Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pure Organic red persistent phosphorescent materials, possessing high&#8208;temperature resistance and superior tissue penetration, can be efficiently fabricated using a host&#8211;guest doping strategy. The triplet&#8208;to&#8208;triplet Dexter energy transfer process plays a crucial role in modulating the luminescent properties of both the host and the guest. These materials hold promise for applications in advanced information encryption and bioimaging.








Abstract
Organic materials with red persistent phosphorescence hold immense promise for biotechnology due to their excellent tissue permeability and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios. However, inefficient spin&#8208;orbit coupling, high triplet susceptibility, and narrow energy gapspromoted&#160;nonradiative deactivations, pose a formidable obstacle to achieving efficient red phosphorescence. This study addresses these challenges by introducing xanthone (Xan)&#8208;based host&#8211;guest systems. Utilizing polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) as guests, efficient red to near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphorescent materials with ultralong lifetimes and high quantum yields of up to 821 ms and 2.32%, respectively, are successfully developed. Ultrafast spectroscopy and theoretical studies reveal that Dexter energy transfer (DET) is the dominant mechanism responsible for red phosphorescence. This DET process between Xan and PAHs not only effectively utilizes the dark triplet state of the Xan host but also significantly enhances the triplet generation of the PAH guests, transforming them into potent phosphorescent luminophores. Furthermore, the inherent rigidity of Xan and PAHs endows the resulting materials with excellent phosphorescence performance, even at elevated temperatures (e.g., 423 K). This strategy, proven to be general, paves the way for designing efficient red/NIR phosphorescent materials through the DET mechanism, enabling their applications in molecular imaging and advanced high&#8208;temperature encryption.

         <title>Photopolymer Resins from Sulfenyl Chloride Commodity Chemicals for Plastic Optics, Photopatterning and 3D&#8208;Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
From oil refining to high refractive index photopolymers for bulk plastic optics. The synthesis of a new photopolymer resin derived from inexpensive sulfur petrochemicals is reported affording a high&#8208;quality optical glass that is amenable to a wide range of photopolymerization&#8208;based fabricated methods, including 3D Printing, for precision plastic optics and micropatterned arrays.








Abstract
The development of a low&#8208;cost photopolymer resin to fabricate optical glass of high refractive index for plastic optics is reported. This new free radically polymerizable photopolymer resin, termed, disulfide methacrylate resin (DSMR) is synthesized by the direct addition of allyl methacrylate to a commodity sulfur petrochemical, sulfur monochloride (S2Cl2). The rapid rates of free radical photopolymerization confer significant advantages in preparing high&#8208;quality, bulk optical glass. The low&#8208;cost, optical glass produced from this photopolymer possesses a desirable combination of high refractive index (n&#160;&#8776;&#160;1.57&#8211;1.59), low birefringence (&#916;n&#160;&lt;&#160;10&#8722;4), high glass transition values (Tg&#160;&#8776;&#160;100&#160;&#176;C), along with optical transparency rivaling, or exceeding that of poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) as indicated by very low optical absorption coefficients (&#945;&#160;&lt;&#160;0.05&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 1310&#160;nm) measured for thick glass DSMR photopolymer samples (diameter (D)&#160;=&#160;25&#160;mm; thickness&#160;=&#160;1&#8211;30&#160;mm). The versatile manufacturability of DSMR photopolymers for both molding and diamond turn machining methods is demonstrated to prepare precision optics and nano&#8208;micropatterned arrays. Finally, large&#8208;scale 3D printing vat photopolymerization of DSMR using high&#8208;area rapid printing digital light processing additive manufacturing is demonstrated.

         <title>Leveraging Strong Electric Field Gradients at Anapole Resonances for Enhanced Second Harmonic Generation from Molybdenum Disulfide Disks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks supporting combined anapole scattering and Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances with not just strong electric field enhancement but also enhanced field gradients for application in resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) are designed, fabricated, and experimentally studied. Some of the highest enhancement numbers reported for the case of the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype of MoS2 are reported.








Abstract
Van der Waals layered materials are emerging as promising nanophotonic platforms for realizing linear and nonlinear optical devices. In particular, the high refractive indices of transition metal dichalcogenides, combined with their strong layer dependent optical properties offer interesting possibilities for designing photonic functionalities. In this study, the resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks on a silicon substrate with an intermediate silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer is demonstrated. The resonant enhancement observed here is attributed to the combined interaction of the anapole scattering modes supported within the disk and Fabry&#8208;Perot (FP) modes within the multilayer stack. For a fixed MoS2 disk dimensions, an optimized SiO2 layer thickness results in constructive interference between the anapole and FP modes, thereby enhancing the fundamental field within the disk. Utilizing this resonance mechanism, SHG enhancements as high as 160 and 85&#8208;times are experimentally demonstrated when compared with unpatterned multilayer and monolayer MoS2 flakes respectively. These are the highest reported enhancement values for the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype MoS2. A significant enhancement in SHG is observed here for 2H&#8208;MoS2 despite the alternating sheet dipoles canceling the far&#8208;field emission owing to the strong electric field gradient setup within the disk at the anapole resonance.

Smart windows with anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and thermally stable characteristics for all&#8208;day modulation are crafted, demonstrating appealing stability and durability for practical building energy&#8208;saving applications.








Abstract
Thermochromic smart windows offer energy&#8208;saving potential through temperature&#8208;responsive optical transmittance adjustments, yet face challenges in achieving anti&#8208;UV radiation, fast response, and high&#8208;temperature stability characteristics for long&#8208;term use. Herein, the rational design of Hofmeister effect&#8208;enhanced, nanoparticle&#8208;shielded composite hydrogels, composed of hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), poly(N,N&#8208;dimethylacrylamide) (PDMAA), sodium sulfate, and polydopamine nanoparticles, for anti&#8208;UV, fast&#8208;response, and all&#8208;day&#8208;modulated smart windows is reported. Specifically, a three&#8208;dimensional network of PDMAA is created as the supporting skeleton, markedly enhancing the thermal stability of pristine HPMC hydrogels. Sodium sulfate induces a Hofmeister effect, lowering the lower critical solution temperature to 32 &#176;C while accelerating phase transition rates fivefold (30 s vs. 150 s). Intriguingly, small&#8208;sized polydopamine nanoparticles simultaneously enable high luminous transmittance of 66.9% and outstanding anti&#8208;UV capability. Additionally, the smart window showcases a high solar modulation (51.2%) and maintains a 10.2 &#176;C temperature reduction versus a glass window during all&#8208;day modulation applications. The design strategy is effective, opening up new avenues for manufacturing fast&#8208;response and durable thermochromic smart windows for energy savings and emission reduction.

         <title>Point Defects Enhance Cross&#8208;Plane Thermal Conductivity In Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (&#954;) by scattering heat&#8208;carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross&#8208;plane &#954; from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon&#8208;phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross&#8208;plane &#954; of graphite.








Abstract
Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (&#954;) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat&#8208;carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications. Here an opposite effect is reported where the introduction of point defects in graphite with energetic particle irradiation increases its cross&#8208;plane &#954; by nearly a factor of two, from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. Integrated differential phase contrast imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the creation of spiro interstitials in graphite by the irradiation. The enhancement in &#954; is attributed to a remarkable mechanism that works to the benefit of phonon propagation in both the harmonic and anharmonic terms: these spiro interstitial defects covalently bridge neighboring basal planes, simultaneously enhancing acoustic phonon group velocity and reducing phonon&#8211;phonon scattering in the graphite structure. The enhancement of &#954; reveals an unconventional role of lattice defects in heat conduction, i.e., easing the propagation of heat&#8208;carrying phonons rather than impeding them in layered materials, inspiring their applications for thermal management in heavily radiative environments.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two MCOFs with dual&#8208;active centers are designed as LMB separators to enable efficient Li plating/stripping. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and electron&#8208;donating diarylamine nitrogen create an electron&#8208;rich environment, regulating the local conjugated Li+ microenvironment. The designed Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent Li plating/stripping stability for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has gained attention as an anode material for lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) owing to its low electrochemical potential, high specific capacity, and low density. However, the accumulation of Li dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphases, caused by sluggish Li+ migration and uneven Li deposition, limit practical LMB applications. This study presents the first report on redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with dual&#8208;active centers as functional separators for LMBs. These MCOFs facilitate homogeneous Li nucleation and accelerate Li+ ion transport. The synergistic effects of redox&#8208;active diarylamine units and trinuclear copper clusters modulate local electron&#8208;cloud density, regulating microenvironment of Li+ ions and ensuring homogeneous Li nucleation. The MCOF&#8208;based separator's well&#8208;defined 1D channels in MCOF&#8208;based separator enable uniform Li+ flux, and promote homogeneous Li deposition, resulting in high Li+ transference number of 0.93 and an ionic conductivity of 2.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The Li|Cu cell demonstrates a low Li nucleation barrier of 16 mV, while the Li symmetric cell exhibits stable Li plating/stripping for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the assembled LMB exhibits stable capacity retention of &#8776;98%. This work paves the way for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes in high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Inverse Oxide/Alloy&#8208;Structured Nanozymes with NIR&#8208;Triggered Enzymatic Cascade Regulation of ROS Homeostasis for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme, Co7Fe3/ZnO@C, is developed to achieve near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered enzymatic cascade regulation. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, hot electrons are transferred from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, activating synchronized superoxide dismutase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, peroxidase&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity&#8208;like enzymatic activities. These cascaded activities enable spatiotemporal modulation of reactive oxygen species dynamics, synergistically integrating chemodynamic therapy, photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy to accelerate infected wound healing.








Abstract
The precise spatiotemporal control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging remains pivotal for infected wound healing. However, conventional nanozymes fail to adaptively regulate ROS dynamics across inflammatory and proliferative phases. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;activated inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme (Co7Fe3/ZnO@C) is developed, featuring enzymatic cascade activities to tune ROS homeostasis through synergistic chemodynamic (CDT), photodynamic (PDT), and photothermal (PTT) therapies. The nanozyme orchestrates a self&#8208;regulated cascade: peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity initially generates bactericidal hydroxyl radicals in acidic wounds, while subsequent NIR triggers hot electron transfer from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, facilitating synchronized superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) activities to scavenge residual ROS. This cascaded network dynamically balances ROS production (POD) and scavenging (NIR&#8208;driven SOD/CAT/HORAC), eradicating bacteria while resolving inflammation. In vitro/vivo studies have shown that the proposed method for maintaining ROS homeostasis can markedly enhance the rate of wound healing by the regulation of the inflammatory environment within the injured tissue and the facilitation of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization. This work provides an intelligent nanozyme platform that simulates the function of natural enzymes and constructs a cascade reaction strategy to balance the antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory demands in the wound microenvironment.

This study presents the synthesis of mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanodrugs containing a BODIPY&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer and a dual nanozyme for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. Their tumor therapeutic ability, dual nanozyme activities, mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation, and intratumoral and systemic immunositimulation capacity underscore their potential as a paradigm for efficient photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
CGAS&#8208;STING agonists generally lead to hyperimmunity and systemic toxicity, hindering their immunotherapeutic outcomes. Herein, a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist (termed HABH) containing boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer (BDP) and Au&#160;nanoparticle&#8208;engineered hollow mesoporous silica (HMSN/AuNPs) has been fabricated for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. The HABH nanoagonist can actively target tumor tissues and release the mitochondrion&#8208;targeted BDP. Under light illumination, BDP achieves type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mitochondria, generating massive hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and inducing mitochondrial stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner, promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Simultaneously, the HMSN/AuNPs act as dual nanozymes to derive cascade reactions for &#8226;OH production, elevating the intracellular oxidative state, and together with the BDP&#8208;induced mitochondrial stress, finally evoking the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and facilitating the release of type I interferon. In the orthotopic breast tumor models, the HABH nanoagonist achieved intratumoral and systemic immunoactivation for eradicating primary tumors and preventing metastasis tumors. Therefore, the constructed mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist enabled light&#8208;controlled and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING activation, providing a paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Induced Static and Dynamic Interface Double Shields for Long&#8208;Lifespan All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid based wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte inducing static and dynamic interface double shields of Zn anodes is developed for achieving highly stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an operating temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;40&#8211;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have experienced substantial advancements recently, while the aqueous electrolytes exhibit limited thermal adaptability. The low&#8208;cost Zn(BF4)2 salt possesses potential low&#8208;temperature application, while brings unsatisfied stability of Zn anodes. To address this challenge, an ionic liquid based eutectic electrolyte (ILEE) utilizing the Zn(BF4)2 presenting remarkable stability across a temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;100&#8211;150 &#176;C is developed, enabling ZIBs to operate in diverse thermal conditions. The inner Zn2+ solvation structure can be modulated to a BF4&#8722;&#8208;rich state within the ILEE system, forming a static ZnF&#8322; layer at the electrolyte&#8208;Zn anode interface, as evidenced by ab initial molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the positively charged EMIM+ can accumulate on the Zn anodes to form the secondary electrostatic dynamic shield that mitigates the uncontrollable Zn dendrites growth, enhancing the overall cycling life of Zn anodes to over 10 times compared with the pure Zn(BF4)2 system. When utilizing the ILEE as the electrolyte, PANI||Zn full cells demonstrate acceptable performances under the all&#8208;temperature environments, especially presenting a long life of over 9500 cycles at a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C and 500 cycles at a high temperature of 60 &#176;C. This special ILEE holds significant promise for future aqueous batteries in extreme environment.

         <title>Biplane Ion&#8208;Pairing Induced Supramolecular Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Uranium Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) pincer complex probe is proposed to achieve the direct recognition of anionic [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; using a new strategy where the overlapping of thick hydration shells drives an assembly. This hydration&#8208;shell&#8208;promoted assembly endows the probe with excellent specificity, a rapid response, and high sensitivity (14.89&#160;fg). This study paves the way for exploring new approaches for the direct detection of highly hydrated ions.








Abstract
It is still challenging to directly recognize the anionic species [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, the dominant species in the environment (82%&#8208;93%), using current optical probes because of the adverse effects of its thick hydration shell on binding interactions. In this study, a water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) methylated terpyridine complex ([Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+) supramolecular probe is designed to directly target [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; by a new strategy of thick hydration shell overlapping arrangement. The optical response demonstrates excellent selectivity among &#8776;30 investigated interfering substances, along with rapid response (&#8776;15&#160;s), high sensitivity (64.1&#160;nm) and dual&#8208;signals. It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the superior detection performance is attributed to the formation of a unique supramolecular structure featuring biplane&#8208;like building block, bicolumnar stacking and water&#8208;bridged anionic networks, via the overlap of thick hydration shells of aligned [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; to boost a superentropic driving force, and the distinguishable dual&#8208;signals arises from the emergence of four types of Pt&#8208;Pt interactions, generating low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer adsorption/emission. In addition, a [Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+&#8208;based hydrogel platform is constructed for detecting both anionic and cationic uranium, with a detection limit of 14.89&#160;fg. This work unlocks not only a way to directly detect [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, but also a new idea for sensing ions with extreme thick hydration layers.

         <title>Incorporating Ordered Indium Sites into Rhodium for Ultra&#8208;Low Potential Electrocatalytic Conversion of Ethylene Glycol to Glycolic Acid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating ordered oxyphilic In sites into Rh to form RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) facilitates the ultra&#8208;low&#8208;potential electrooxidation of ethylene glycol into the high&#8208;value chemical, glycolic acid. The synthesized RhIn IMCs&#160;also exhibit outstanding electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Using RhIn&#160;IMCs as bifunctional catalysts, a two&#8208;electrode system is established for ethylene glycol electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production.








Abstract
The upcycling of polyethylene terephthalate (PET)&#8208;derived ethylene glycol (EG) to glycolic acid (GA, a biodegradable polymer monomer) via electrocatalysis not only produces valuable chemicals but also mitigates plastic pollution. However, the current reports for electrooxidation of EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA usually operate at reaction potentials of &gt;1.0 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), much higher than the theoretical potential (0.065 V vs RHE), resulting in substantial energy wastage. Herein, body&#8208;centered cubic RhIn intermetallic compounds (IMCs) anchored on carbon support (denoted as RhIn/C) are synthesized, which shows excellent performance for the EG&#8208;to&#8208;GA with an onset potential of only 0.35 V vs RHE, lower than the values reported in current literature. The catalyst also possesses satisfactory GA selectivity (85% at 0.65 V vs RHE). Experimental results combined with density functional theory calculations demonstrate that RhIn IMCs enhance the adsorption of EG and OH&#8722;, facilitating the generation of reactive oxygen species and thereby improving catalytic performance. RhIn/C also exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for hydrogen evolution reaction, ensuring that it can be used as a bifunctional catalyst in the two&#8208;electrode system for EG electrooxidation coupled with hydrogen production. This work opens new avenues for reducing the energy consumption of electrocatalytic upcycling of PET&#8208;derived EG and clean energy production.

         <title>3D Molecular&#8208;Reconstructed Disordered Precursor Toward Highly Stable Porous Ramie Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) with high mechanical strength and high density are achieved via the molecular reconstruction method. As a demonstration, this highly stable porous ramie carbon&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a prominent energy density of 28.11 Wh kg&#8722;1 and a high&#8208;power density of 47.94 kW kg&#8722;1 simultaneously, evidently higher than commercial YP&#8208;50F (12.67 Wh kg&#8722;1 and 40.86 kW kg&#8722;1).








Abstract
Biomass porous carbon possesses broad application prospects in the field of energy storage. However, soft biomass materials with high cellulose content and orders structure usually represent low mechanical strength, which leads to unstable pore structure of prepared porous carbon and even prone to collapse, thus reducing the quality and stability of carbon. Herein, a simple molecular reconstruction method is proposed to effectively re&#8208;construct 3D disordered ramie precursors (DRPs) by regulating the chemical interaction of hydrogen bonds. Benefiting from high mechanical strength and high density of DRPs, the highly stable porous ramie carbon (PRC) can display a higher specific surface area of 2404.36 m2 g&#8722;1 than that of ordinary ramie carbon (2142.25 m2 g&#8722;1). Moreover, this PRC&#8208;based supercapacitor delivers a high specific capacitance of 39.35 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and an excellent capacity retention rate of 89.5% at 40 A g&#8722;1 in 1 M Et4NBF4/AN. Attractively, the evolution process of ion adsorption during the charge&#8211;discharge process has been uncovered by using in situ electrochemical infrared spectroscopy, confirming the excellent structural stability of PRC. This work provides new insights into preparing biomass precursors with high strength derived from soft biomass materials, greatly promoting the application of soft biomass materials in commercial activated carbon.

         <title>Hierarchical&#8208;Structured RGO@EGaIn Composites as Advanced Self&#8208;Healing Anode for Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO naturally adsorbs onto the surface of LMPs via electrostatic interactions, self&#8208;assembles into a core&#8211;shell structure, and subsequently reduces to RGO in an acidic solution. The presence of RGO in the hierarchical structural composites significantly improves the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, suppressing and accommodating the irregular deformation of LMPs during the electrochemical reaction process and promoting the formation of a stable SEI film.









Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising candidate anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting high theoretical capacity, excellent electrode kinetics, and unique self&#8208;healing ability. However, the liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid transition during the electrochemical reactions can disrupt the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and damage the structural integrity, ultimately limiting the cycling stability. Here, hierarchical&#8208;structured reduced graphene oxide coated eutectic gallium&#8208;indium liquid metal particles (RGO@EGaIn LMPs) are synthesized using a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy. The customized RGO@EGaIn electrode demonstrated impressive performance in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations for LIBs. The morphological and phase transitions of RGO@EGaIn LMPs during the lithiation/delithiation processes are uncovered by real&#8208;time in situ transmission electron microscopy tests. It is clarified that the presence of RGO in the hierarchical structure buffers the volume expansion of LMPs from &#8776;160% to 125% and provides a fast pathway for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode. This work introduces a straightforward and effective method for preparing high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature liquid metal electrodes, representing a significant step forward toward the commercial application of liquid metal batteries.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Induced Decoupling Drives Gold&#8208;Assisted Exfoliation of Large&#8208;Area Monolayer 2D Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Au substrate induces a strain in the adhered bottommost MoS2 layer. The strain weakens the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface, making it the weakest point in the system, therefore MoS2 crystal preferentially cleaves at this interface, facilitating the selective exfoliation of large&#8208;area monolayers with size comparable to that of the parent crystal.








Abstract
Gold&#8208;assisted exfoliation (GAE) is a groundbreaking mechanical exfoliation technique that produces centimeter&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal monolayers of 2D materials. Such large, high&#8208;quality films offer unparalleled advantages over the micron&#8208;sized flakes typically produced by conventional exfoliation techniques, significantly accelerating the research and technological advancements in the field of 2D materials. Despite its wide applications, the fundamental mechanism of GAE remains poorly understood. In this study, using MoS&#8322; on Au as a model system, ultra&#8208;low frequency Raman spectroscopy is employed to elucidate how the interlayer interactions within MoS2 crystals are impacted by the gold substrate. The results reveal that the coupling at the first MoS2&#8208;MoS2 interface between the adhered layer on the gold substrate and the adjacent layer is substantially weakened, with the binding force being reduced to nearly zero. This renders the first interface the weakest point in the system, thereby the crystal preferentially cleaves at this junction, generating large&#8208;area monolayers with sizes comparable to the parent crystal. Biaxial strain in the adhered layer, induced by the gold substrate, is identified as the driving factor for the decoupling effect. The strain&#8208;induced decoupling effect is established as the primary mechanism of GAE, which can also play a significant role in general mechanical exfoliations.

         <title>&#8220;Water&#8208;In&#8208;Oil&#8221; Electrolyte Enabled by Microphase Separation Regulation for Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microphase separated &#8220;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8221; (W/O) electrolyte is proposed to simultaneously regulate the water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and electrode interface. Benefiting from the directed movement and reversible demulsification of micelles under the electric field, the as&#8208;developed zinc metal batteries using W/O electrolyte exhibits extended cyclability, improve interface dynamics and negligible H2 evolution.








Abstract
The sustained hydrogen evolution and zinc (Zn) dendrite growth greatly impede the practical application of low&#8208;cost aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs). Herein, for the first time, a microphase separation strategy is proposed to construct a &#8243;water&#8208;in&#8208;oil (W/O) electrolyte to endow durable ZMBs. As validated by theoretical modeling and experimental characterizations, the unique reverse micelle structure within the electrolyte not only disrupts water hydrogen bonding and efficiently inhibits the water consumption at Zn anode, but also undergoes directed movement and reversible demulsification under electric field, thus enhancing the anode desolvation kinetics and inhibiting the interfacial side reactions. Owing to the simultaneous regulation of water molecules in both electrolyte bulk and anode interface, this W/O electrolyte achieves a high Zn plating/stripping Coulombic efficiency of 99.76% over 6000 cycles, and maintains an extend lifespan in Zn||V10O24&#183;12H2O (VOH) cells with negligible hydrogen evolution and dendrite formation. These key findings are expected to promote the electrolyte engineering toward reversible ZMBs.

         <title>Kinetically Dormant Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathode During High&#8208;Voltage Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni&#8208;rich layered cathode remains thermodynamically reversible but undergoes dramatic kinetic degradation at high voltage, leading to the commonly observed capacity loss that in fact can be recovered under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from layered/rock&#8208;salt structural heterogeneity during charge.








Abstract
The degradation of Ni&#8208;rich cathodes during long&#8208;term operation at high voltage has garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. Despite many post&#8208;mortem qualitative structural analyses, precise quantification of their individual and coupling contributions to the overall capacity degradation remains challenging. Here, by leveraging multiscale synchrotron X&#8208;ray probes, electron microscopy, and post&#8208;galvanostatic intermittent titration technique, the thermodynamically irreversible and kinetically reversible capacity loss is successfully deconvoluted in a polycrystalline LiNi0.83Mn0.1Co0.07O2 cathode during long&#8208;term charge/discharge cycling in full cell configuration. Contradicting the dramatic capacity loss, the layered structure remains highly alive even after 1000 cycles at 4.6 V while undergoing a three&#8208;order of magnitude reduction in the mass transfer kinetics, leading to almost fully recoverable capacity under kinetic&#8208;free conditions. Such kinetic dormant behavior after cycling is not simply ascribed to poor chemical diffusion by reconstructed cathode surface but highly synchronizes with the lattice strain evolution stemming from the structural heterogeneity between deeply delithiated layered and degraded rock&#8208;salt phases at high voltage. These findings deepen the degradation mechanism of high&#8208;voltage cathodes to achieve long&#8208;cycling and fast&#8208;charging performance.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Computing with Visual&#8208;Tactile Perception Enabled by Mechano&#8208;Optical Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechano&#8208;optical artificial synapse that enables in&#8208;sensor computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception is achieved by integrating photostimulated luminescence with self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescence materials. The multimodal artificial synapse demonstrates an individual and synergistic plasticity in a remotely accessible manner and enables neuromorphic pattern recognition and materials identification. This work paves the way to construct flexible in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing paradigm holds the promise of realizing rapid and low&#8208;power signal processing. Constructing crossmodal in&#8208;sensor computing systems to emulate human sensory and recognition capabilities has been a persistent pursuit for developing humanoid robotics. Here, an artificial mechano&#8208;optical synapse is reported to implement in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception. By employing mechanoluminescence (ML) material, direct conversion of the mechanical signals into light emission is achieved and the light is transported to an adjacent photostimulated luminescence (PSL) layer without pre&#8208; and post&#8208;irradiation. The PSL layer acts as a photon reservoir as well as a processing unit for achieving in&#8208;memory computing. The approach based on ML coupled with PSL material is different from traditional circuit&#8211;constrained methods, enabling remote operation and easy accessibility. Individual and synergistic plasticity are elaborately investigated under force and light pulses, including paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning behavior, and short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory. A multisensory neural network is built for processing the obtained handwritten patterns with a tablet consisting of the device, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 92.5%. Moreover, material identification has been explored based on visual&#8208;tactile sensing, with an accuracy rate of 98.6%. This work provides a promising strategy to construct in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.

         <title>Non&#8208;Hermitian Boundary in a Surface Selective Reconstructed Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study is the first to propose that the surface reconstruction of a Weyl semimetal creates a Hermitian bulk&#8208;non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The non&#8208;Hermitian effects arising from the surface reconstruction are manifested by the emergence of non&#8208;topological surface Fermi arcs (NTSFAs) and the broadening of both topological surface Fermi arcs (SFAs) and NTSFAs. These effects are demonstrated through angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements in a surface&#8208;reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi.








Abstract
Non&#8208;Hermitian physics, studying systems described by non&#8208;Hermitian Hamiltonians, reveals unique phenomena not present in Hermitian systems. Unlike Hermitian systems, non&#8208;Hermitian systems have complex eigenvalues, making their effects less directly observable. Recently, significant efforts have been devoted to incorporating the non&#8208;Hermitian effects into condensed matter physics. However, progress is hindered by the absence of a viable experimental approach. Here, the discovery of the surface&#8208;selectively spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi provides a feasible experimental platform for studying non&#8208;Hermitian physics. Utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements, surface&#8208;projected density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements, it is demonstrated that surface reconstruction in NdAlSi alters surface Fermi arc (SFA) connectivity and generates new isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs (NTSFAs) by introducing non&#8208;Hermitian terms. The surface&#8208;selective spontaneous reconstructed Weyl semimetal NdAlSi can be viewed as a Hermitian bulk &#8211; non&#8208;Hermitian boundary system. The isolated non&#8208;topological SFAs on the reconstructed surface act as a loss mechanism and open boundary condition (OBC) for the topological electrons and bulk states, serving as non&#8208;Hermitian boundary states. This discovery provides a good experimental platform for exploring new physical phenomena and potential applications based on boundary non&#8208;Hermitian effects, extending beyond purely mathematical concepts. Furthermore, it provides important enlightenment for constructing topological photonic crystals with surface reconstruction and studying their topological&#160;properties.

         <title>Rolling the Dice with Light Competition: Introducing a True Random Number Generator Powered by Photo&#8208;Induced Polarity Current</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces the ALTRNG, utilizing a BPPD to generate random bits via unpredictable&#160;arc discharge illumination. Validated by 15 NIST tests, ALTRNG produces highly random bit streams. With a 2&#8208;kbps readout circuit, it enables wireless random number transmission, offering potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The pursuit of hardware&#8208;based security solutions has highlighted the true random number generator (TRNG). Various physical phenomena, from noise generation to quantum physics complexities, have been explored for random number generation. The arc discharge light&#8208;induced TRNG (ALTRNG) is introduced, featuring wavelength&#8208;dependent photocurrent generation and arc discharge irradiation. A bipolar photo&#8208;responsive photodetector (BPPD) differentiates &#8220;1&#8221; and &#8220;0&#8221; states, producing highly random bits validated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 15 tests. The BPPD's response to deep&#8208;ultraviolet (DUV) and blue light enables distinct photocurrent generation under arc discharge illumination. The ALTRNG generates true random signals, yielding bit streams with unpredictability, uniform distribution, and stability. With a readout circuit achieving 2&#8208;kbps, wireless random number transmission is demonstrated, highlighting potential for secure password systems and artificial X&#8208;ray image generation.

A carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine (AMGA) is developed, which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs without requiring light irradiation for precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy of triple&#8208;negative breast cancer both in vitro and in vivo. AMGA can specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the endo/lysosome escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs, simultaneously downregulating miRNA&#8208;21 and miRNA&#8208;10b, and release the chemotherapeutic drug gemcitabine.








Abstract
Although anti&#8208;microRNA (miRNA) is capable of silencing target miRNA and regulating multiple mRNAs in diverse signaling pathways, RNA medicines still encounter numerous challenges, especially in terms of poor delivery, inefficient endo/lysosomal escape, and suboptimal treatment. Herein, we have developed a carrier&#8208;free supramolecular nanoengine, AMGA (anti&#8208;miRNA/GEM2&#8208;Azo), which significantly enhances the cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNA without requiring light irradiation, thereby facilitating precise targeting and synergistic chemo&#8208;gene therapy for triple&#8208;negative breast cancer (TNBC). AMGA can be rapidly internalized by cancer cells and specifically generate nanomechanical force to promote the efficient escape of anti&#8208;miRNAs from the endo/lysosome to the cytoplasm, simultaneously downregulating miR&#8208;21 and miR&#8208;10b. In comparison to Lipofectamine 2000, AMGA demonstrated superior efficacy in inhibiting the proliferation, migration, and invasion of cancer cells. Significantly, AMGA exhibited profound antitumor and gene silencing effects in an orthotopic human TNBC mouse model. This novel supramolecular nanoengine presents a promising strategy for cytosolic delivery of anti&#8208;miRNAs.

         <title>Colossal Electromechanical Response in Antiferroelectric&#8208;based Nanoscale Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The careful design of interfaces in PbHfO3&#8208; and PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3&#8208;based multilayer heterostructures results in electromechanical strain &#8776;4.8% for films as thin as 120 nm. Such studies can significantly advance the understanding about electromechanically&#8208;active thin films which can surpass the detrimental effects of substrate&#8208;induced clamping to demonstrate strain values and be implemented in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The pursuit of smaller, energy&#8208;efficient devices drives the exploration of electromechanically active thin films (&lt;1 &#181;m) to enable micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the electromechanical response of such films is limited by substrate&#8208;induced mechanical clamping, large electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric and multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures have garnered interest. Here, multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures based on antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and ferroelectric PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 overcome substrate clamping to produce electromechanical strains &gt;4.5%. By varying the chemistry of the PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 layer (x = 0.3&#8208;0.6) it is possible to alter the threshold field for the antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric phase transition, reducing the field required to induce the onset of large electromechanical response. Furthermore, varying the interface density (from 0.008 to 3.1 nm&#8722;1) enhances the electrical&#8208;breakdown field by &gt;450%. Attaining the electromechanical strains does not necessitate creating a new material with unprecedented piezoelectric coefficients, but developing heterostructures capable of withstanding large fields, thus addressing traditional limitations of thin&#8208;film piezoelectrics.

         <title>Enhancing the Performance of Fluorinated Graphdiyne Moisture Cells via Hard Acid&#8208;Base Coordination of Aluminum Ions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a groundbreaking MEG method, highlighting the application of fluorinated graphdiyne in novel moisture cells. A unique Al ion&#8208;F coordination mechanism is introduced, significantly enhancing ion migration and conductivity. Coupled with the FGDY's macroporous structure, the FGDY Al&#8208;ion moisture cell achieves outstanding performance metrics.








Abstract
Moisture&#8208;enabled electric generators (MEGs) are emerging as a transformative energy technology, capable of directly converting ambient moisture into electrical energy without producing pollutants or harmful emissions. However, the widespread application of MEGs is hindered by challenges such as intermittent output and low current densities, which limit power density and prevent large&#8208;scale integration. Here, a novel moisture cell based on Al ion&#8208;F coordination&#8212;specifically, a fluorinated graphdiyne (FGDY) Al&#8208;ion moisture cell (FGDY AlMC) is introduced. This new moisture cell achieves an exceptionally high mass&#8208;specific power density of 371.36&#160;&#181;W&#160;g&#8722;&#185;, stable output (0.65 V for 15 h), and broad applicability across varying humid environments. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the large&#8208;pore molecular structure of FGDY significantly reduces the diffusion barriers for Al ions compared to other 2D carbon materials. Furthermore, the F atoms as &#8220;hard base&#8221; on FGDY effectively coordinate with &#8220;hard acid&#8221; Al ions, enhancing ionic conductivity, accelerating ion migration, and promoting the generation of a higher number of mobile cations. These combined advantages lead to a marked improvement in the performance of the FGDY AlMC. These findings position Al ion coordinated FGDY as a highly promising candidate for the development of high&#8208;performance MEG active materials.

Engineered lipid vesicles, powered by enzyme&#8208;driven symmetry breaking and transient lipid ordering, demonstrate rotational and translational motion. This innovative approach presents exciting possibilities for biomedical applications, particularly in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled lipid&#8208;based artificial cells that can achieve controlled rotation and directed translation present significant potential for biomedical applications, yet their engineering poses considerable challenges. Lipid vesicles synthesized via solution&#8208;based methods naturally adopt isotropic spherical shapes. Active motion of these spherical objects requires symmetry breaking and rigidity. In this study, giant vesicles are employed as chassis, utilizing enzymes that undergo cyclic, non&#8208;reciprocal conformational changes as power sources. Weak, transient protein&#8208;protein interactions induce lipid ordering leading to rigidity and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Upon activation of enzyme reactions, these spherical vesicles demonstrate a variety of motion patterns, from pure spinning to 3D spiral trajectories. From experiments and simulations, it is demonstrated how such motion enables the vesicles to cross complex barriers. By utilizing biocompatible and scalable materials, The methodology establishes a solid framework for the design of such self&#8208;propelled systems. The work paves the way for advancements in biomedical and environmental technologies such as targeted drug delivery and active matter research.

         <title>CuPt Alloy Enabling the Tandem Catalysis for Reduction of HCOOH and NO3&#8722; to Urea at High Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; synthesis of urea with high Faraday efficiency at high current density is successfully achieved by synthesizing the Cu4Pt tandem catalyst loaded on copper foam. The doped Pt sites can enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form a large number of *CO key intermediates to lay the foundation for subsequent C&#9472;N coupling.








Abstract
The formation of urea by electrocatalytic reduction of C1&#8208;reactants and NO3&#8722; is an attractive way to store renewable electricity, close the carbon cycle, and eliminate nitrate contaminants from wastewater. Involving insufficient supply of C1 reactants and multiple electron transfers makes the reaction difficult to achieve high Faraday efficiency and high yield at high current density. Here, a urea synthesis approach is presented via electrocatalytic reductive coupling between liquid HCOOH and NO3&#8722; on copper foam (CF) loaded Cu4Pt catalyst with optimized ratios. A urea yield of 40.08 mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 is achieved with FE up to 58.1% at a current density of &#8722;502.3 mA cm&#8722;2, superior to the productivity of previously reported catalysts. No degradation is observed over 120&#8208;h continuous operation at such a high yield rate. The highly efficient activity of Cu4Pt/CF can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pt and Cu sites via tandem catalysis, in which the doped Pt sites enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form and adsorb large amounts of *CO key intermediates. The Cu sites can generate large quantities of the key intermediate *NH2. The Cu4Pt/CF adsorbed intermediates *CO and *NH2 are the basis for subsequent thermodynamic spontaneous C&#9472;N coupling.

Involving insufficient supply of C&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; reactants and multiple electron transfers makes the reaction difficult to achieve high Faraday efficiency and high yield at high current density. Here, a urea synthesis approach is presented via electrocatalytic reductive coupling between liquid HCOOH and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; on copper foam (CF) loaded Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt catalyst with optimized ratios. A urea yield of 40.08 mg h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved with FE up to 58.1% at a current density of &#8722;502.3 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, superior to the productivity of previously reported catalysts. No degradation is observed over 120-h continuous operation at such a high yield rate. The highly efficient activity of Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt/CF can be attributed to the synergetic effect between Pt and Cu sites via tandem catalysis, in which the doped Pt sites enrich liquid HCOOH reactants, promote HCOOH intermolecular dehydration, and form and adsorb large amounts of &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO key intermediates. The Cu sites can generate large quantities of the key intermediate &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The Cu&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt/CF adsorbed intermediates &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;CO and &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the basis for subsequent thermodynamic spontaneous C&#9472;N coupling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Opto&#8208;Iontronic Cholesteric Liquid Crystalline Retina for Multimodal Circularly Polarized Neuromorphic Vision</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL across a broad spectrum, with an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V).








Abstract
Circularly polarized light (CPL) is fundamental to phase&#8208;controlled imaging, quantum optics, and optical computing. Conventional CPL detection, relying on polarizers and quarter&#8208;wave plates, complicates device design and reduces sensitivity. Among emerging CPL detectors, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFET) with helical organic semiconductors are highly promising due to their compact structures but suffer tedious synthesis, low dissymmetric factors (gph &lt;&#160;0.1), and high operating voltages (&gt; 50&#160;V). To address these issues, an opto&#8208;iontronic cholesteric liquid crystalline (i&#8208;CLC) film is developed that is both electrically and photonically active, serving as the dielectric in phototransistors. The well&#8208;defined cholesteric structure and broadly tunable pitches of the i&#8208;CLC film enable it to detect CPL with an excellent &#8220;handedness&#8221; selectivity across a broad spectrum. Moreover, its ionic nature provides a high capacitance (up to 580&#160;nF cm&#8722;2 @20&#160;Hz). The resulting flexible CPL detectors achieve an unprecedentedly high dissymmetry factor (gph = 1.33) at low operating voltages (&lt; 5&#160;V), showcasing significant potential in optical communication and data encryption. Furthermore, leveraging high gph, they can perform in&#8208;sensor computing for highly accurate semantic segmentation using fused multimodal visual inputs (e.g., circularly polarized and ordinary light), achieving an accuracy of 75.73% and a mean intersection over the union of 0.3982, surpassing the performance of non&#8208;CPL photodetectors. Additionally, it optimizes power consumption by a factor of 102 compared to most conventional visual processing systems, offering a groundbreaking hardware solution for high&#8208;performance neuromorphic CPL vision.

         <title>A Soft Nonpolar&#8208;Soluble Two&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite for General Construction of Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nonpolar soluble 2D perovskite, noted as TPA2PbI4, is developed to construct controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions without solid reactions with the initial 3D perovskite films. This strategy improves both the performance of small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and large&#8208;area perovskite modules, promoting 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules to achieve a certified efficiency of 22.06%.








Abstract
Constructing mixed&#8208;dimensional heterojunctions through ion exchange between functional organic ammonium halides and the already&#8208;deposited bulk 3D perovskite films is a widely adopted strategy to effectively passivate and stabilize perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Such process poses challenges in precisely controlling the composition and distribution of the heterojunctions across the film, in particular for large&#8208;area applications. Here, a soft 2D perovskite based on tetrapheptyl&#8208;ammonium iodide (TPAI), noted as TPA2PbI4 is reported. It is the first&#8208;reported nonpolar readily soluble 2D perovskite, leading to highly compact and oriented perovskite layers. In addition, this nonpolar soluble TPA2PbI4 is beneficial to universally construct thickness&#8208;controllable mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite heterojunctions to suppress the non&#8208;radiative recombination and promote charge&#8208;carrier transfer on all the FA&#8208;, MA&#8208; and CsPbI3 PSCs. Such a unique strategy is also suitable for upscaling fabrication, demonstrated by 30&#160;cm &#215; 30&#160;cm FAPbI3 perovskite submodules with a certified efficiency of 22.06%.

         <title>Mixed Electrolyte Enabling Ultrafast Mass Transport and Compatibility with Polypropylene Separator for Stable and Low&#8208;Cost Aluminum Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mixed electrolyte (IL&#8208;FB (1:5)) for aluminum ion batteries is synthesized by incorporating fluorobenzene into ionic liquid electrolyte. The IL&#8208;FB (1:5) promotes mass transport, enabling cycling for 7500 h under high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also exhibits significantly improved wetting ability with the polypropylene separator, guaranteeing 60% reduction in the cost of the AIB.








Abstract
The energy industry has taken notice of aluminum ion batteries (AIB) for their low cost, high safety, and high capacity. However, using the ionic liquid electrolyte results in the uneven Al electrodeposition and the reliance on expensive glass fiber separators, due to the sluggish mass transport and low wettability for the polypropylene separator. Herein, a mixed electrolyte is introduced by incorporating the co&#8208;solvent fluorobenzene into the traditional AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride ionic liquid, in which the fluorobenzene (FB) mitigates electrostatic interactions between ions and facilitates the ion diffusion. The optimization principle for the mixed electrolyte is proposed based on maximizing the mass transportation, as indicated by the limiting current density. The optimized mixed electrolyte IL&#8208;FB (1:5) offers the highest limiting current density of 12&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, highly reversible plate/stripe of Al, and thus stable cycling for 7500 h with the high current density and capacity (8 mA cm&#8722;2, 8 mAh cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, IL&#8208;FB (1:5) also shows enhanced wettability for the polypropylene separator. The AIB with the polypropylene separator, exhibiting 60% decrease in cost, is achieved for the first time by using IL&#8208;FB (1:5), presenting a crucial step toward the initial practical application.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the homo&#8208;hetero double&#8208;junction coupling strategy, the directional electron&#8211;hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built&#8208;in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge&#8208;carrier behavior, which achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2.








Abstract
Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built&#8208;in electric field that efficiently separates the electron&#8211;hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (FO) subsequently constructs the homo&#8208;hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built&#8208;in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20&#160;min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real&#8208;life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal. This homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy opens up new avenues in weakening exciton effects and precisely controlling the generation of free radicals.

     alt="Homo-Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Through the homo-hetero double-junction coupling strategy, the directional electron&#8211;hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built-in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge-carrier behavior, which achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo-hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built-in electric field that efficiently separates the electron&#8211;hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of &#945;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FO) subsequently constructs the homo-hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built-in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; from O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20&#160;min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real-life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enabled by Solubility Control Toward 19% Organic Solar Cells via Compatible Air Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted guest acceptor BTP&#8208;4Cl is introduced to fine&#8208;tune the solubility of host components to address the excessive aggregation issue in blade&#8208;coated processing. It is found that the twisted molecular conformation profited in inducing longer intermolecular distance and dispersing molecular distribution in the solvent. Simultaneously, the guest acceptor positively influenced the crystalization kinetics by providing nuclei seeding sites. Finally, a fine phase separation is achieved in the open&#8208;air blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 19.67%.









Abstract
Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade&#8208;coated OSCs still lag behind their spin&#8208;coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP&#8208;4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP&#8208;eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm2), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies among the reported blade&#8208;coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin&#8208;coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility&#8208;tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open&#8208;air coating conditions.

         <title>Development of Ternary Hydrogel Electrolytes for Superior Gel Thermocells: Exceptional Anti&#8208;Drying, Anti&#8208;Freezing, and Mechanical Robustness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible wearable ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) by integrating a thermosensitive crystallizing agent, and supporting electrolyte into a natural nanocellulose hydrogel matrix is designed and constructed, which exhibits a remarkable thermopower, an optimized effective ionic conductivity, anti&#8208;drying, freezing resistance, and mechanical robustness. This work provides a versatile strategy for developing TGTC, contributing to advancements in low&#8208;grade energy harvesting and wearable electronics for the Internet of Things era.








Abstract
Gel thermocells (GTCs) provide a safe, facile, and scalable solution for harvesting waste heat to power ubiquitous electronics. However, achieving a harmonious integration of high power density, wide&#8208;temperature&#8208;range stability, and mechanical robustness in GTCs remains a significant challenge. In this work, a novel ternary gel thermocell (TGTC) is proposed and fabricated by integrating ferro/ferricyanide (Fe(CN)63&#8722;/4&#8722;) redox couples, thermosensitive crystallizing agents guanidinium chloride (GdmCl), and supporting electrolytes lithium chloride (LiCl) into natural nanocellulose hydrogels to enhance overall performance. GdmCl selectively induces Fe(CN)64&#8722; crystallization, increasing the concentration difference of redox pairs, resulting in improving thermopower and significantly increased fiber friction, while LiCl rapidly balances charges through electromigration promoting efficient ion transport and reconstructing hydrogen bond networks, contributing to an excellent output power density and the capture of water molecules, which are further elucidated by simulations, achieving synchronous enhancement of anti&#8208;drying, anti&#8208;freezing and mechanical properties. Consequently, the TGTC achieves a remarkable thermopower of 3.42&#160;mV K&#8722;1, a maximum power density of 2.8&#160;mW m&#8722;2 K&#8722;2, multiple continuous stable cycles at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, and an impressive strength of 3.06&#160;MPa. Notably, this study elucidates the design principles and underlying mechanisms of ternary gel electrolytes, offering a practical strategy for advancing GTC technology.

         <title>A Universal Solution for Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design criteria for a lithiation solution that enables spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions for the direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 are proposed. Using machine learning (ML), the redox potentials of various solution systems are identified and revealed a critical relationship: the lower the redox potential, the more effective the lithiation of degraded LiFePO4 materials.








Abstract
Lithiation reactions driven by chemical potential offer a promising avenue for directly regenerating degraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP). However, the choice of solution system significantly influences the lithium supplementation where improper selection may result in poor lithium recovery or extremely slow kinetics. Herein, it is identified that the most critical factor affecting solution repair effectiveness is the redox potential of the anions in the solution, which determines whether spent LFP (SLFP) can undergo spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions. Then, machine learning (ML) is used for prediction and screening of huge potential solution systems, and finally a general strategy is proposed: creating a low redox potential solution system that incorporates anions with either low redox potential or moderate redox potential at high concentrations. As a demonstration, the regenerated LFP by ascorbic acid and LiOH solution systems exhibits a high discharge capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 96% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. This work establishes an important criteria for designing solution systems to restore degraded LFP, marking a significant advancement in the direct regeneration of cathode materials from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>17.68% Efficiency Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cell Modules Driven by Seed Crystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's J&#8211;V curve (right) highlights the transition from small&#8208;area cells to industrial&#8208;scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.








Abstract
Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small&#8208;area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High&#8208;boiling, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified small&#8208;molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6. Moreover, BDTF&#8208;CA2O effectively suppresses excessive phase separation, and optimizes vertical distribution, resulting in enhanced exciton extraction, balanced carrier transport, and reduced recombination losses. Small&#8208;area toluene&#8208;processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &gt;10 cm2 to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large&#8208;scale production of efficient, large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules.

&lt;p&gt;The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF-CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; curve (right) highlights the transition from small-area cells to industrial-scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small-area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High-boiling, non-halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)-modified small-molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF-CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6. Moreover, BDTF-CA2O effectively suppresses excessive phase separation, and optimizes vertical distribution, resulting in enhanced exciton extraction, balanced carrier transport, and reduced recombination losses. Small-area toluene-processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large-area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &amp;gt;10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large-scale production of efficient, large-area organic solar cell modules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Breathable 2D Photothermal Fabric with Three&#8208;Layered Structure for Efficient Four&#8208;Plane Evaporation of Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by leaf structure and the transpiration process, a breathable 2D photothermal fabric with a three&#8208;layer structure for efficient four&#8208;plane evaporation of seawater is developed. The fabric evaporator achieves faster evaporation rates (2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2), outperforming single&#8208;plane (1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and double&#8208;plane (1.9 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) evaporations.








Abstract
2D photothermal membranes have demonstrated numerous advantages in solar desalination due to their flexibility, scalability, and low cost. However, their practical applications are limited by the restricted evaporation area and obstructed vapor channels. A biomimetic design of the breathable 2D photothermal fabric is reported, which is composed of two carbon&#8208;nanotube&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;coated polyester (PET) fabrics separated by fiber pillars, with the upper fabric layer having a hole array as stomatal channels. This fabric shows high solar&#8208;absorption efficiency (96.1%) and decreased water&#8208;evaporation enthalpy (1664.6 kJ kg&#8722;1). The hanging fabric as a heliotropic evaporator exhibits four&#8208;plane evaporation feature and achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2) illumination, better than the traditional floated model (single&#8208;plane, 1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). The evaporation rate can be further enhanced to 4.2 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 upon introducing adscititious airflow (2 m s&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the heliotropic&#8208;hanging design allows the dropping of concentrated brine, avoiding solid&#8208;salt&#8208;crystallization.

         <title>Regulating Interface Engineering by Helmholtz Plane Reconstructed Achieves Highly Reversible Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergistic regulation strategy is proposed by introducing a small amount of Pyridine oxide (PNO). The preferentially adsorbed PNO constitutes a protective layer in the Inner Helmholtz Plane and inhibits the activity of water within the Outer Helmholtz plane via customizing solvation sheath. That's blocking the direct contact of active water and the anode, leading to highly reversible aqueous zinc metal batteries.








Abstract
The rampant dendrite growth and notorious parasitic reactions significantly compromise the stability of zinc anodes in aqueous zinc metal batteries, presenting substantial for their practical applications. Herein, this work proposes a synergistic strategy that reconstructs the Helmholtz plane to precisely regulate the interface chemistry between the anode and the electrolyte. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that even a small amount of pyridine oxide (PNO) additive effectively alters the coordination environment and reorganizes the solvation sheath in the Outer Helmholtz Plane (OHP). Simultaneously, PNO molecules preferentially adsorbed on the anode surface, displacing active water from the Inner Helmholtz Plane (IHP). Through synergistic regulation in both the OHP and IHP, zinc ions achieve compact and dense deposition along the Zn (002) crystal plane, while parasitic reactions catalyzed by active water are effectively suppressed. Consequently, the symmetric cell incorporating the PNO additive demonstrates stable cycling performance, maintaining more than 2300&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and sustaining over 400&#160;h even at a high depth of discharge of 85%. Furthermore, the Zn||AQ cell retains 80% of its capacity after 3000 cycles and exhibits outstanding cycling stability even under the high active material mass loading (22&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) using the modified electrolyte.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer Aerogels with Increased Accessibility of Well&#8208;Defined Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites as a New Paradigm of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general strategy is developed to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (denoted as M&#8208;CCPA, M = Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) that can markedly increase the accessibility of their well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom metal sites within their hierarchically porous structures with mesopores and nanopores, which can provide a wide space for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts toward various energy&#8208;conversion systems.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal utilization efficiency is of significance, which presents enormous potentials to be extensively applied. It is desired yet challenging to elaborately tailor the coordination structures of active sites in SACs and simultaneously enable sufficient accessibility of these active sites to reactants. Here, a facile and general strategy to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (CCPA) with porous architectures that can markedly increase the accessibility of their elaborately&#8208;tailored active sites, which as a new electrocatalyst paradigm can fully present both the structural advantages of SACs and aerogel materials, is reported. Taking nickel (Ni) as an example, Ni&#8208;based CCPA (Ni&#8208;CCPA) and its counterpart Ni&#8208;CCP with non&#8208;aerogel feature are studied as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept case. Electrochemical measurements show that, relative to Ni&#8208;CCP, Ni&#8208;CCPA exhibits appreciably higher performance toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the experimental results and theoretical simulations unravel that the improved OER performance of Ni&#8208;CCPA arises from the accelerated OH&#8722; diffusion within its porous architecture and enhanced OH&#8722; concentration near its highly exposed active sites at its high&#8208;curvature surfaces with localized electric fields. Importantly, as evidenced by the Cu&#8208;CCPA and Zn&#8208;CCPA examples, such strategy can be promisingly applied to prepare high&#8208;performance CCPA targeted toward various catalytic reactions and beyond.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Urea on High&#8208;Density Ga&#9472;Y Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst via Cross&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide and nitrate into urea via the C&#8211;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#8211;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate is developed for urea electrosynthesis. Experiments and theories reveal that strong cross&#8208;synergizing coupling between Ga&#8208;Y sites contributed to improving the electrosynthesis performance of urea.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into urea via the C&#9472;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology, but it is still limited by poor yield rate, low Faradaic efficiency, and insufficient coupling kinetics. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#9472;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst is developed with loading up to 14.1 wt.% of Ga and Y supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Ga/Y&#8208;CNP) for urea electrosynthesis. The catalyst facilitates efficient C&#9472;N coupling through co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, resulting in a high urea yield rate of 41.9 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations&#160;reveal that the superior performance is attributed to the cross&#8208;tuning between adjacent pair Ga&#9472;Y sites, which can mutually optimize their electronic states for facilitating CO2 reduction to *CO at Ga sites and promoting NO3&#8722; conversion to hydroxylamine (*NH2OH) at Y sites, followed by spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NH2OH intermediates at Ga&#9472;Y sites to form C&#9472;N bonds. This work offers a pioneering strategy to manipulate C&#9472;N coupling pathways by cross&#8208;tuning active sites to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide and nitrate into urea via the C&#8211;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology. Herein, a high-density Ga&#8211;Y dual-atom catalyst supported on N, P-co-doped carbon substrate is developed for urea electrosynthesis. Experiments and theories reveal that strong cross-synergizing coupling between Ga-Y sites contributed to improving the electrosynthesis performance of urea.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and nitrate (NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) into urea via the C&#9472;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology, but it is still limited by poor yield rate, low Faradaic efficiency, and insufficient coupling kinetics. Herein, a high-density Ga&#9472;Y dual-atom catalyst is developed with loading up to 14.1 wt.% of Ga and Y supported on N, P-co-doped carbon substrate (Ga/Y-CNP) for urea electrosynthesis. The catalyst facilitates efficient C&#9472;N coupling through co-reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, resulting in a high urea yield rate of 41.9 mmol h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations&#160;reveal that the superior performance is attributed to the cross-tuning between adjacent pair Ga&#9472;Y sites, which can mutually optimize their electronic states for facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to *CO at Ga sites and promoting NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; conversion to hydroxylamine (*NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH) at Y sites, followed by spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;OH intermediates at Ga&#9472;Y sites to form C&#9472;N bonds. This work offers a pioneering strategy to manipulate C&#9472;N coupling pathways by cross-tuning active sites to produce high-value-added chemicals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy 1T&#8208;Phase Quantum Sheets of Transition&#8208;Metal Disulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;strained high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets during the exfoliation process. The resultant 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving good electrochemical properties in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. 








Abstract
Quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are promising nanomaterials owing to the combination of both 2D nanosheets and quantum dots with distinctive properties. However, the quantum sheets usually possess semiconducting behavior associated with 2H phase, it remains challenging to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets due to the easy sliding of the basal plane susceptible to the small lateral sizes. Here, an efficient high&#8208;entropy strategy is developed to produce 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets of transition&#8208;metal disulfides based on controllable introduction of multiple metal atoms with large size differences to retard the sliding of basal plane. The key is the topological conversion of in&#8208;plane ordered carbide laminates (i&#8208;MAX) compatible with multiple atoms to high&#8208;entropy transition&#8208;metal disulfides with high strains and 1T phase, which facilely triggers the fracture into 1T&#8208;phase quantum sheets with average size of 4.5 nm and thickness of 0.7 nm during the exfoliation process. Thus, the 1T&#8208;phase disulfide quantum sheets show high electrocatalytic activities for lithium polysulfides, achieving a good rate performance of 744 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C and a long cycle stability in lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Reduction of Nonradiative Recombination at Perovskite/C60 Interface in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adopting a bimolecular synergistic passivation strategy, it is feasible to achieve micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;structural modulation of the perovskite surface, thereby passivating surface defects, regulating interface energy levels, and enhancing the interface electric field. This approach maximizes the reduction of nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface and demonstrates universal applicability across perovskite/C60 interfaces with different bandgaps.








Abstract
Although p&#8208;i&#8208;n type inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve excellent photoelectric efficiencies, the nonradiative recombination at the perovskite/C60 interface is still the key factor affecting the overall efficiency of p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. Herein, a synergistic passivation strategy (meta&#8208;fluoro&#8208;phenylethylammonium iodide and piperazine iodide) is developed to modify the perovskite/C60 interface in p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs. This strategy facilitates in situ reconstruction of the perovskite film to obtain a smooth and flat perovskite surface. Furthermore, the two molecules work synergistically to passivate surface defects, adjust the interface energy levels, and bolster the interface electric field, all of which reduce the nonradiative recombination losses at the perovskite/C60 interface. The optimal PSCs adopting this strategy achieve a power conversion efficiency of 25.85%. (certified value of 25.22%). After operating at the maximum power point for 1000 h, the 95% initial efficiency can be maintained. Furthermore, this process is universally applicable and scalable.

         <title>Minimizing Buried Interface Energy Losses with Post&#8208;Assembled Chelating Molecular Bridges for High&#8208;Performance and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chelating molecule (CB&#8208;PA) serves as both a top&#8208;interface molecular bridge and a void&#8208;filler to improve the buried interface quality and promote carrier extraction, leading to a high efficiency of 25.27% and superior stability for inverted MA&#8208;free perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) as hole&#8208;collecting materials have made remarkable progress in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, the incomplete coverage of SAMs and the non&#8208;intimate interface contact between perovskite/SAMs usually cause inferior interface characteristics and significant energy losses at the heterojunction interface. Herein, a post&#8208;assembled chelating molecular bridge strategy using 5&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)isophthalicacid (CB&#8208;PA) is developed to modify the perovskite/SAMs buried interface. It is found that CB&#8208;PA can be chemically coupled with MeO&#8208;2PACz through &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking between carbazole groups, and chelate with perovskite by forming double C&#9552;O&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb bonds, thus constructing a bridge&#8208;connected interface to promote carrier extraction. Simultaneously, the post&#8208;assembled CB&#8208;PA can fill the voids of MeO&#8208;2PACz to form dense hybrid SAMs, resulting in uniform surface potential and improved interface contact. Moreover, CB&#8208;PA treatment also tends to induce the oriented crystallization of perovskite films, passivate interface defects, and release lattice stress at the buried interface. Consequently, the CB&#8208;PA&#8208;based inverted PSCs achieve a champion efficiency of 25.27% with superior operational stability, retaining &#8776;94% of their initial efficiency after maximum power point (MPP) tracking (65&#160;&#176;C) for 1000 h with ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol. This work provides an innovative strategy to address the buried interface challenges for high&#8208;performance inverted PSCs.

         <title>Crack&#8208;Resistant and Self&#8208;Healable Passive Radiative Cooling Silicone Compounds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates the impact of crack damage on passive radiative cooling and introduces a self&#8208;healing, crack&#8208;resistant radiative cooling silicone/boron nitride compound, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This approach makes the material self&#8208;heal cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and can prevent further crack propagation under stress through crack blunting and deflection.








Abstract
Crack damage and expansion are prevalent issues in outdoor materials, which absorb or transmit sunlight to damaged areas, substantially impairing the functionality of passive radiative cooling systems. Herein, a silicone/dielectric radiative cooling compound is introduced that is both self&#8208;healing and crack&#8208;resistant, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack&#8208;resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This network incorporates boron nitride dielectrics, which serve as sunlight scatterers and hydrogen bond acceptors, with customized silicone polymer featuring high atmospheric window emissive chain segments and UV&#8211;vis&#8208;NIR transparent hydrogen bond moieties. When cracks form, the polymer's chain mobility allows the hydrogen bond moieties in boron nitride and silicone to re&#8208;associate, realizing self&#8208;healing of cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and restoring cooling performance to &#8776;100%. The combination of rigid boron nitride and sacrificial hydrogen bonds in polymer also enhances the materials&#8217; fracture energy to 865%, effectively preventing further crack propagation under stress through autonomous crack blunting and deflection. These remarkable characteristics make this radiative cooling compound highly suited for increasingly complex, dynamic, and prolonged outdoor application environments.

&lt;p&gt;This study investigates the impact of crack damage on passive radiative cooling and introduces a self-healing, crack-resistant radiative cooling silicone/boron nitride compound, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack-resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This approach makes the material self-heal cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and can prevent further crack propagation under stress through crack blunting and deflection.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Crack damage and expansion are prevalent issues in outdoor materials, which absorb or transmit sunlight to damaged areas, substantially impairing the functionality of passive radiative cooling systems. Herein, a silicone/dielectric radiative cooling compound is introduced that is both self-healing and crack-resistant, developed through the synthesis of a dynamic and crack-resistant polymer/dielectric hydrogen bond network. This network incorporates boron nitride dielectrics, which serve as sunlight scatterers and hydrogen bond acceptors, with customized silicone polymer featuring high atmospheric window emissive chain segments and UV&#8211;vis-NIR transparent hydrogen bond moieties. When cracks form, the polymer's chain mobility allows the hydrogen bond moieties in boron nitride and silicone to re-associate, realizing self-healing of cracks from micrometers to millimeters wide and restoring cooling performance to &#8776;100%. The combination of rigid boron nitride and sacrificial hydrogen bonds in polymer also enhances the materials&#8217; fracture energy to 865%, effectively preventing further crack propagation under stress through autonomous crack blunting and deflection. These remarkable characteristics make this radiative cooling compound highly suited for increasingly complex, dynamic, and prolonged outdoor application environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong and Tough Water&#8208;Tolerant Conductive Eutectogels with Phase&#8208;Separated Hydrophilic/Hydrophobic Dual Ionic Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An eutectogel (PSDIC&#8208;gel) with exceptional integrative properties is successfully developed by blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, in which spontaneously forming dual ionic channels through in situ polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The transparent PSDIC&#8208;gel exhibits remarkable tensile strength, high toughness, excellent ionic conductivity, improved water tolerance, and rapid room temperature self&#8208;healing ability, thus, has wide application prospects in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Eutectogels are emerging as the next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics due to their superior ionic conductivity, non&#8208;volatility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, most eutectogels suffer from weak mechanical strength and toughness and pronounced hygroscopicity. Herein, a strategy is proposed to fabricate phase&#8208;separated eutectogels with dual ionic channels (PSDIC&#8208;gel), which exhibit exceptional integrative properties, especially water resistance. By blending hydrophilic/hydrophobic polymerizable deep eutectic solvents, dual ionic channels spontaneously form via polymerization&#8208;induced phase separation. The hydrophilic poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) phase containing Li+&#8208;channels, rich in hydrogen bonding and ion&#8208;dipole interactions, provides mechanical strength and conductivity. The hydrophobic poly(hexafluorobutyl acrylate) (PHFBA) phase incorporating cholinium cation (Ch+) channels enhances toughness, conductivity, and water resistance. Adjusting the phase ratio yields a microphase&#8208;separated transparent eutectogel with high tensile strength (6.03&#160;MPa), toughness (16.18&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), excellent ionic conductivity (1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S&#160;m&#8722;1), strong substrate adhesion, and rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing. Solid&#8208;state NMR reveals the conductive mechanism and the phase&#8208;separated structure featuring dual ionic channels in PSDIC&#8208;gels, advancing the understanding of complex ionic interactions at the atomic level. The PSDIC&#8208;gel enables a flexible triboelectric nanogenerator for accurate real&#8208;time self&#8208;powered human motion sensing. This work advances eutectogel design through structure&#8208;property engineering, offering a universal strategy to reconcile mechanical robustness, environmental suitability, and ionic conductivity for wearable electronics.

         <title>Highly Bright Pure Room Temperature Phosphorescence for Circularly Polarized Organic Hyperafterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient strategy is proposed for achieving highly bright and narrowband organic hyperafterglow by isolating conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. Efficient energy and chirality transfers afford multi&#8208;color hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of&#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39 nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770 ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of&#8776;10&#8722;3.








Abstract
Pure room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (pRTP) promises great advantages in both exciton utilization and lifetime manipulation over existing organic luminophores for a variety of emerging applications, but the low brightness, low efficiency, and low color purity constrain the afterglow luminescence significantly. Here, a promising approach to design highly bright, efficient, and narrowband pRTP with long&#8208;lifetime for organic hyperafterglow is proposed by isolating a conjugated energy donor with circularly polarized (CP) luminescence and energy acceptor with multi&#8208;resonance effect into a rigid host. It is shown that the aggregation of chiral P&#8208;containing binaphthyl promotes the generation of CP&#8208;pRTP and afterglow with high brightness up to &#8776;50&#160;cd m&#8722;2, while the simultaneous energy transfer and chirality transfer afford multi&#8208;color organic hyperafterglow with photoluminescence efficiency of &#8776;90%, full&#8208;width at half maxima of 31&#8211;39&#160;nm, lifetime of 120&#8211;770&#160;ms, and luminescent dissymmetry of &#8776;10&#8722;3. Also, excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, organic solvents, and aqueous solutions of strong acids and bases are observed. With these advantages, applications of chirality information encryption, afterglow grayscale imaging, and 3D high&#8208;resolution afterglow models are realized, promoting significantly the fundamental understandings on the modulation of organic afterglow brightness and construction of high&#8208;performance pRTP materials with advanced photophysical properties and applications.

         <title>Benchmarking Corrosion with Anionic Polarity Index for Stable and Fast Aqueous Batteries Even in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Since the water&#8208;induced corrosion in aqueous electrolytes, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, will have a very adverse impact on the lifespan and rate performance of aqueous batteries. Through theoretical simulation, a strategy of anionic polarity index is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water simultaneously, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries.








Abstract
Despite aqueous electrolyte endowing batteries with the merits of safe operation, low&#8208;cost fabrication, and high ionic conductivity, water&#8208;induced corrosion, including spontaneous chemical and electrochemical hydrogen evolution corrosion, adversely affects lifespan and rate capability. There is still a lack of selection criteria for benchmarking corrosion behavior qualitatively. Through theoretical simulation, an anionic polarity index (API) tactic is proposed to resist corrosion by manipulating interfacial and solvated water concomitantly, thus realizing stable and fast Zn aqueous batteries (ZABs). As proof of concept, a low&#8208;cost zinc salt of 0.5 m zinc bis(4&#8208;hydroxybenzenesulphonate) (Zn(HBS)2) with low&#8208;API anion is prioritized. Combined in situ spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses reveal that, even in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte, the low&#8208;API anion reduces interfacial water in the inner Helmholtz plane, shielding the chemical water dissociation. Meanwhile, their entering into the solvation sheath of Zn2+ lowers the solvent&#8208;separated ion pair, suppressing the electrochemical corrosion. The elaborated API&#8208;screened zinc salt endows fast plating kinetics of 50 mA cm&#8722;2 (119.1 mV polarization), high coulombic efficiency of 99.8%, dendrite&#8208;free cycling over 1600 h, and prolonged lifespan over 5000 cycles for the Zn&#8208;V cell. The results provide new metrics that can benchmark the success of ZABs for large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering Modulates Lignin&#8208;Metal Supramolecular Framework to Construct Carbon&#8208;Coated CoRu Alloy for Effective Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts are synthesized via a Lignin&#8208;Metal supramolecular framework by molecular weight engineering. Lignin with low molecular weight formed graphitic carbon layers with high defect density, resulting in excellent activity but limited stability. While lignin with high molecular weight produced amorphous carbon layers that enhanced durability. In&#8208;situ Raman and DFT indicate that defect density controls electron transport and intermediate adsorption.








Abstract
To overcome the challenges of low catalytic activity and instability, a molecular weight engineering strategy coupled with oxidative ammonolysis is developed to synthesize CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts with distinct morphologies and properties from biorefinery lignin. This approach effectively modulates intrinsic active sites and exposes unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;oxygen structures, thereby tailoring the morphology and defect structure of the carbon layers in the catalysts. The as&#8208;synthesized CoRu alloy catalysts from lignin precursors with varying molecular weights are designated as CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOH, and CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual. CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, featuring a defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, exhibited exceptional overall water&#8208;splitting performance (1.48 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly surpassing Pt/C || Ru/C (1.58 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In contrast, CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual, with its amorphous carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, demonstrated remarkable stability (350 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), vastly outperforming Pt/C || Ru/C (6 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that the defect&#8208;rich carbon layers effectively adsorb *H intermediates, accelerating the catalytic process. This strong adsorption also induces carbon layer rearrangement, leading to its dissolution of the carbon layer and oxidation of CoRu metal particles.

     alt="Molecular Weight Engineering Modulates Lignin-Metal Supramolecular Framework to Construct Carbon-Coated CoRu Alloy for Effective Overall Water Splitting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;CoRu-based alloy catalysts are synthesized via a Lignin-Metal supramolecular framework by molecular weight engineering. Lignin with low molecular weight formed graphitic carbon layers with high defect density, resulting in excellent activity but limited stability. While lignin with high molecular weight produced amorphous carbon layers that enhanced durability. In-situ Raman and DFT indicate that defect density controls electron transport and intermediate adsorption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To overcome the challenges of low catalytic activity and instability, a molecular weight engineering strategy coupled with oxidative ammonolysis is developed to synthesize CoRu-based alloy catalysts with distinct morphologies and properties from biorefinery lignin. This approach effectively modulates intrinsic active sites and exposes unsaturated nitrogen-oxygen structures, thereby tailoring the morphology and defect structure of the carbon layers in the catalysts. The as-synthesized CoRu alloy catalysts from lignin precursors with varying molecular weights are designated as CoRu@OALC-EtOAC, CoRu@OALC-EtOH, and CoRu@OALC-Residual. CoRu@OALC-EtOAC, featuring a defect-rich graphitic carbon-coated CoRu alloy structure, exhibited exceptional overall water-splitting performance (1.48 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), significantly surpassing Pt/C || Ru/C (1.58 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In contrast, CoRu@OALC-Residual, with its amorphous carbon-coated CoRu alloy structure, demonstrated remarkable stability (350 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), vastly outperforming Pt/C || Ru/C (6 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). In-situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that the defect-rich carbon layers effectively adsorb &lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;H intermediates, accelerating the catalytic process. This strong adsorption also induces carbon layer rearrangement, leading to its dissolution of the carbon layer and oxidation of CoRu metal particles. This strategy provides a universal method for biomass-derived catalysts, establishing a direct relationship between molecular weight, catalyst morphology, and electrocatalytic performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeted High&#8208;Resolution 3D Imaging of Tumor Vasculatures at Different Stages Using Far&#8208;Red AIE Nanoparticles Compatible with Tissue Clearing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an imaging technology for precise mapping and analysis of lung tumor vasculature at different stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue optical clearing (TOC). The advanced imaging technique reveals significant insights into tumor vascular dynamics, offering valuable implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
The occurrence and progression of blood vessels plays a pivotal role in different stages of tumor development, while current imaging techniques exhibit limited sensitivity to capture the dynamic changes of vasculature at different tumor stages. This drawback hinders the comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment, thereby impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. Herein, a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging technology is developed for mapping and analyzing vasculatures at different tumor stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue clearing. The hyaluronic acid (HA) in HA@TANP specifically targets CD44 antigen of tumor vasculature, while the acrylic acid in HA@TANP is applied for temperature&#8208;induced polymerization to ensure the covalent attachment of AIE fluorophores. Additionally, tissue optical clearing technology boosts light penetration and imaging resolution in dense tumor tissues. This strategy allows for the quantitative analyses of vascular diameter, length, and straightness and their correlation with various responses to treatments. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of distinct tumor vascular stages, providing valuable insights for enhanced cancer diagnosis and therapies from a tumor vascular&#8208;targeted perspective.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Based Multicompartment Photonic Pigments: Unlocking Non&#8208;Iridescent Pure RGB Structural Colors for Versatile Chromatic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research presents a novel class of multicompartment photonic pigments derived from vegetable oils, leveraging biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers to effectively mitigate Ostwald ripening in complex emulsion systems. Through the development of an innovative structural model, non&#8208;iridescent pure red hues are achieved in photonic glass, enabling unprecedented versatility in chromatic engineering via an RGB three&#8208;primary color mixing strategy.








Abstract
Non&#8208;iridescent photonic glass pigments of block copolymers show great potential for sustainable structural coloration. However, the ability to create accurate RGB color mixtures for real&#8208;world applications is limited by the prevalent use of non&#8208;degradable, fossil oil&#8208;derived components and the difficulty in achieving pure red hues. This work presents an alternative strategy for achieving more sustainable structural coloration by fabricating composite photonic pigments through controlled self&#8208;assembly of water, vegetable oil, and biodegradable bottlebrush block copolymers (BBCPs) in a complex emulsion system. The obtained photonic balls feature unprecedented multicompartment structures characterized by a short&#8208;range ordered assembly of water nanodroplets stabilized by the BBCPs, along with oil droplets stabilized by these nanodroplets, which substantially enhances resistance to Ostwald ripening. Furthermore, a new structural model is introduced to eliminate disordered scattering, successfully creating a pure red structural color and overcoming a long&#8208;standing limitation in versatile chromatic engineering.

A novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, develope via a scalable solid&#8208;state approach, forms a distinctive 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Fe configuration that induces reverse hydrogen spillover and promotes proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction. The optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C with stable operation for 200 h.









Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction (P&#8208;ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid&#8208;state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single&#8208;atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P&#8208;ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single&#8208;atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

         <title>Universal Prophylactic Antitumor Vaccination Using Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced pluripotent stem cell membrane is coated onto adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle cores to create a universal cancer vaccine. The formulation utilizes oncofetal antigens present on the cell membrane to elicit broadly protective immune responses in vivo. The enhanced immunity generated by the nanovaccine enables robust prophylactic efficacy against multiple murine tumor models.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines are a promising immunotherapeutic modality that function by training the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. As tumor&#8208;specific and tumor&#8208;associated antigens generally cannot be identified until after a tumor has already been established, these vaccines must be applied therapeutically when strong immunosuppressive mechanisms are already in place. Building upon previous work using cell membrane coating nanotechnology, the development of a broad&#8208;spectrum prophylactic cancer nanovaccine that consists of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) membrane coated around an adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle core is shown. The resulting nanostructure is capable of presenting iPSC&#8208;derived oncofetal antigens, which are oftentimes re&#8208;expressed on cancer cells but lowly present on normal adult tissues. When administered in vivo, the iPSC membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are highly immunostimulatory and elicit strong antitumor immunity that can successfully inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types, including five different murine tumor models and in a bilaterial heterogeneous tumor model. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach for engineering iPSC&#8208;based nanovaccines that can be applied broadly to prevent cancer before it occurs.

         <title>Molecular Design of Dimeric Acceptor Enables Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.78% Efficiency and Enhanced Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>

By optimizing building blocks and linking modes, a dimeric acceptor, named DY&#8208;FL, is innovatively designed and synthesized. Benefiting from the efficient molecular design strategy, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs rendered an efficiency of 19.78%. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices showcased significantly enhanced photo/thermal stability in comparison to small molecule acceptor&#8208;based OSCs.








Abstract
The development of organic solar cells (OSCs) with high efficiency and stability is highly desirable to facilitate its commercial applications. Although dimeric acceptors with distinctive advantages have been widely studied, high&#8208;performance binary OSCs based on such molecules have rarely been achieved. In this work, a new dimeric acceptor (DY&#8208;FL) is constructed by simultaneously optimizing the linking sites and units, as well as the building blocks. Thanks to the effective molecular design, DY&#8208;FL provides improved molecular stacking for fibrous morphology with favorable exciton/charge dynamics. Consequently, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based binary OSCs render a superior power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.78%, representing a record&#8208;breaking efficiency for binary OSCs based on dimeric acceptors. Importantly, DY&#8208;FL&#8208;based devices display significantly enhanced operational stability under external stimuli such as light and heat, in comparison to their small molecule acceptor (Y&#8208;F)&#8208;based counterpart. These findings highlight the significance of building blocks and linking modes, providing insight into the effective molecular design strategy of dimeric acceptors for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs.

         <title>Monomolecule Coupled to Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt phthalocyanine molecule&#8208;modified oxygen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst achieves superior oxygen reduction with two&#8208;electron selectivity of 99% and hydrogen peroxide yield of 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. The modulation of the electronic structure of active sites through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking&#8208;mediated oxygen doping optimizes the interaction between active sites and intermediate *OOH.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an ideal alternative for the industrial anthraquinone process because of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, depending on the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Carbon&#8208;based materials possess prospects as candidate catalysts for the production of H2O2. Herein, cedar&#8208;derived monolithic carbon catalysts modified with coupling oxygen doping and phthalocyanine molecules are synthesized. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#160;molecules are introduced onto the carbon surface to construct monomolecular active sites via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The electronic structure of CoPc is modulated by oxygen doping on carbon substrates, mediated by monomolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. A synergistic effect optimally modulated the interaction between CoPc and key intermediate to H2O2. The energy barrier for oxygen reduction is reduced to optimize the selectivity to H2O2. CoPc@OCW provided up to 99% selectivity to H2O2 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE. In a three&#8208;phase flow cell, CoPc@OCW achieved an H2O2 yield up to 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;V versus RHE with stable running for 24 h. The advantages of carbon&#8208;based catalysts including the adjustable chemical structure depending on &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electronic structure of carbon atoms through oxygen doping improved the catalytic performances in the production of H2O2. This proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept research demonstrates the potential application of carbon&#8208;based molecular catalysts for electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Industrial&#8208;current Ammonia Synthesis by Polarized Cuprous Cyanamide Coupled to Valorization of Glycerol at 4,000 mA cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) system featuring Cu2NCN as an efficient nitrate reduction (NO3RR) electrocatalyst, coupled with glycerol oxidation for low&#8208;voltage, industrial&#8208;level NH3 production. Achieving 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V with sustained stability at 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 over 100 h, the system offers 83% Faradaic efficiency, with theoretical insights on NO&#8323;* adsorption and O&#8211;N bond cleavage.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic nitrate reduction (NO3RR) holds significance in both NH3 synthesis and nitrate contamination remediation. However, achieving industrial&#8208;scale current and high stability in membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer remains challenging due to inherent high full&#8208;cell voltage for sluggish NO3RR and water oxidation. Here, Cu2NCN with positive surface electrostatic potential VS(r) is applied as highly efficient NO3RR electrocatalysts to achieve industrial&#8208;current and low&#8208;voltage stable NH3 production in MEA electrolyzer with coupled anodic glycerol oxidation. This paired electro&#8208;refinery (PER) system reaches 4000 mA cm&#8722;2 at 2.52 V and remains stable at industrial&#8208;level 1000 mA cm&#8722;2 for 100 h with the NH3 production rate of 97000 &#181;gNH3 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency of 83%. Theoretical calculations elucidate that the asymmetric and electron&#8208;withdrawing [N&#8722;C&#8801;N] units enhance polarization and VS(r), promoting robust and asymmetric adsorption of NO3* on Cu2NCN to facilitate O&#8722;N bond dissociation. A comprehensive techno&#8208;economic analysis demonstrates the profitability and commercial viability of this coupled system. Our work opens a new avenue and marks a significant advancement in MEA systems for industrial NH3 synthesis.

         <title>Lithiophilic&#8208;Gradient, Li+ Supplementary Interphase Design for Lean Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 14, April 9, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy/power density batteries have become an urgent need for the electric vehicle and consumer electronics markets. In this work, Cheng et&#160;al. develop an lean lithium metal batteries (LLMB) prototype with lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design and self&#8208;supplementary Li sources for bare Cu foil. It provides a new perspective for the optimization strategy for next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
The practicability of anode&#8208;less/free lithiummetal batteries (LMBs) is impeded by unregulated dendrite formation on thedeposition substrate. Herein, this study presents a lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design for the lean lithium metal battery (LLMB) model. Engineered via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry approach, the high entropy metalphosphide (HEMP) particles with tunable lithiophilic species are dispersedwithin reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Moreover, a poly (vinylidene fluoride co&#8208;hexafluoropropylenepolymer) (PVDF&#8208;HFP), blended with molten Li at the tailorable amounts, forms aLi supplementary top layer through a layer&#8208;transfer printing technique. Theintegrated layer (HEMP@RGO&#8208;MTL@PH) not only regulates the dendrite&#8208;free lithiumdeposition towards the Cu substrate up to 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, but also maintains robust cyclability of the symmetric cell at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even under 83% depth of discharge. As pairing the modified Cu foil with the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (NCM811, 16.9 mg cm&#8722;2, double sided, N/P ratio of 0.21) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, achieves gravimetric energy densities of 414.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, power output of 977.1 W kg&#8722;1, as well as highly reversible phasic evolutionmonitored in operando. This gradient interfacial strategy can promotethe commercialization of energy/power&#8208;dense energy storage solutions.

As pairing the modified Cu foil with the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathode (NCM811, 16.9 mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, double sided, N/P ratio of 0.21) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, achieves gravimetric energy densities of 414.7 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, power output of 977.1 W kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, as well as highly reversible phasic evolutionmonitored in operando. This gradient interfacial strategy can promotethe commercialization of energy/power-dense energy storage solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This perspective provides a systematic discussion on the challenges and solutions in designing materials for intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs). It also highlights prospective challenges and offers insights into the development of highly efficient and stable ISOLEDs for practical applications.








Abstract
Wearable electronics require stretchable displays that can withstand large and repeated mechanical deformation without failure. Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) that operate under DC voltage provide promising candidates for wearable display applications. However, the lack of sophisticated stretchable materials and processing techniques suitable for ISOLEDs results in a significant deficit in the efficiency of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ISOLEDs compared to industrial standards. The design of stretchable conducting and semiconducting materials poses a significant challenge because of trade&#8208;off relationships between stretchability and properties such as conductivity and charge carrier mobility. To increase the efficiency of ISOLEDs to meet industrial standards, strategies to overcome these trade&#8208;offs must be developed. This perspective discusses recent progress and challenges in designing stretchable electrodes, light&#8208;emitting materials, transport materials, and potential applications of ISOLEDs. It&#160;provides a useful guide in this field to develop efficient ISOLEDs for system&#8208;level integration.

Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization
In article number 2420510, Walid A. Daoud and colleagues report an atomic&#8208;scale polarization&#8208;functionalized Mn3O4&#8208;based catalyst for vanadium redox flow battery, where the role of vacancy&#8208;induced local polarization on vanadium redox reactions is investigated. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in transition metal oxide electrocatalysts, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes
This cross&#8208;sectional STEM image captures the wave&#8208;like rippling observed in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid 2D MXene. Here, these ripples, often referred to as Ripplocations, are formed when the organic surface groups are exposed to the electron beam. Ripplocations are a fundamental defect in layered materials and may play a key role in how the material responds to stress and external conditions. More details can be found in article number 2411669 by Francisco Lagunas, Robert F. Klie, and co&#8208;workers.

X&#8208;Ray Induced Photodynamic Therapy
A novel biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillator (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) was fabricated to enhance X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) for treating unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The precise tumor localization ability of stereotactic radiotherapy, along with the efficient X&#8208;ray energy absorption and transfer properties of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, provides significant therapeutic potential for HCC treatment, making this phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT a promising alternative for patients with unresectable HCC. More details can be found in article number 2417001 by Feng Shen, Huijing Xiang, Yu Chen, Tian Yang, and co&#8208;workers.

Coated Liquid Metal Droplets
In article number 2414519, Yixiong Feng. Jingyu Sun, Xiuju Song, and co&#8208;workers present a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated cadmium telluride (Cr2Te3)&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8208;LM) droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, non&#8208;adhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magneto&#8208;interactive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic&#8208;material&#8208;based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.

         <title>The Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Quantification for In Situ and Operando Liquid&#8208;Phase Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example,&#160;&#947;&#8208; or X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation&#8208;induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP&#8208;TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

This innovative magnetic ion-generator can not only release Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage-induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti-tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator-based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron-triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese-activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid-derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;material Volumetric Bioprinting and Plug&#8208;and&#8208;play Suspension Bath Biofabrication via Bioresin Molecular Weight Tuning and via Multiwavelength Alignment Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally&#8208;Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN)&#160;is engineered to circumvent the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally&#8208;confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC&#8208;delivered MN significantly inhibits&#160;tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond&#160;to standard chemotherapy due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double&#8208;layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual&#8208;activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self&#8208;oxygenating BSA&#8208;MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near&#8208;infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

         <title>Polyamine&#8208;Depleting Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T&#8208;cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual&#8208;action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic&#8208;assisted synthetic hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine&#8208;depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T&#8208;cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR&#8208;assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)&#8208;H2O2 reaction for CRET&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR&#8208;Cas9. Once released, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)&#8208;related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual&#8208;action strategy not only corrects T&#8208;cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&#8722;1. This hyperspectral metachips are low&#8208;cost, highly compact, and label&#8208;free for fast, high&#8208;throughput and high&#8208;sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanoscale 3D Printing of Calcium Phosphates Using Bone Prenucleation Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bone&#8208;bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two&#8208;photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light&#8208;scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate&#8208;based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage&#8208;tolerant materials, cell&#8208;modulating interfaces, and precision&#8208;engineered coatings.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

     alt="Photo-Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article designs and prepares a photo-responsive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, and Zn-CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release, but also slowly release Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, achieving the joint regulation of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug-delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood-nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo-responsive hydrogen sulfide (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc-citric acid organic metal framework (Zn-CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL-MMD-MAC)-RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive. This simple and highly versatile approach lays the groundwork for advancing the development of more sustainable and functional adhesive materials.

         <title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial&#8208;Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineered MSCs (MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface&#8208;anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) response to release drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS&#8208;responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC&#8208;secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin&#8208;induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Development of Bioorthogonally Degradable Tough Hydrogels Using Enamine N&#8208;Oxide Based Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducibly degradable enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent&#8208;responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide&#8208;based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half&#8208;life of &lt;10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N&#8208;oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N&#8208;oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>

Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid&#8208;state vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe&#8208;based and InP&#8208;based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid&#8208;state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes&#8212;whether pulsed or continuous&#8208;wave, optically or electrically&#8208;pumped&#8212;and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid&#8208;state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely&#8208;variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

         <title>Nanoporous Ag Microparticles with Tailorable and Noncontaminated Nanopores for SERS Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

         <title>Lipoic Acid/Choline Ionic Liquid Enhanced Intratumoral Heat/Mass Transfer for Suppressing Thermo&#8208;Mediated Tumor Relapse and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo&#8208;mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation&#8208;microwave ablation synergy.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field.

     alt="Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid&#8208;Based Archival File System for Random Accessible In Vivo DNA Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed&#8208;loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte&#8208;to&#8208;yottabyte&#8208;scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key&#8208;value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence&#8208;based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital&#8208;to&#8208;biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large&#8208;scale DNA databases.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity&#8208;reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&#8722;1 and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance energy storage systems.

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>

The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non-invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor-associated antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP-PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis- and pyroptosis-mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol-yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non-covalent photosensitizer MBTP-A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP-PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol-yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Generating Self&#8208;Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum&#8208;based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection&#8208;associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria&#8208;derived flagella is described to construct self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge&#8208;reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self&#8208;adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell and B&#8208;cell immune responses. In ovalbumin&#8208;overexpressing melanoma&#8208;bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin&#8208;carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella&#8208;based self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky&#8208;Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on&#8208;demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on&#8208;demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3&#8211;0.5) and slippery state (0.03&#8211;0.07). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de&#8208;icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state-of-the-art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin&#8208;Charge Conversion in Graphene&#8208;Based Quantum System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin&#8208;charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the &#915;&#8208;K and &#915;&#8208;M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34&#8208;fold increase in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin&#8208;pumping on&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad&#8208;hoc first&#8208;principles theory. The improvement in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D&#8208;thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional&#160;computing.

         <title>Triazine&#8208;containing Covalent Organic Polymer&#8208;derived Grid&#8208;Like Multilocular Spheres for Aqueous Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

         <title>Self&#8208;Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient&#8208;Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth.

     alt="High-Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial-scale electrolysis system.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post-treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high-value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA-K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high-performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA-K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA-K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial-scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA-K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>

         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

         <title>Diluted Ternary Heterojunctions to Suppress Charge Recombination for Organic Solar Cells with 21% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long&#8208;ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5&#8208;16:L8&#8208;BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8&#8208;BO and C5&#8208;16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of the diluted p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY&#8208;IT diluted)/L8&#8208;BO:C5&#8208;16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

         <title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;step process, and low&#8208;temperature condition with back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy&#160;hysteresis mapping, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, top&#8208;view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force&#8208;distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size&#8208;controllable challenge&#8208;response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new&#8208;generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, high&#8208;temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on&#8208;demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Spin-orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field-free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT-memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor-deposited two-dimensional (2D) Cr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;/WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non-volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance-area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; using bilayer WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which facilitats low-power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti-parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT-memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT-memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT-memory with PMA field-free switching.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interfacial &#960;&#8208;Electron Cloud Extension and Charge Transfer Between Preferable Single&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated MOFs and Graphene for Ultrafast Pulse Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>

Ultrathin&#8208;conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single&#8208;crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, the preparation of high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single&#8208;crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG&#8208;VHS and NiNsG&#8208;VHS) are achieved by ultrasound&#8208;assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third&#8208;order NLO polarizability of CuNsG&#8208;VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG&#8208;VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rhodamine B&#8208;Derived Low&#8208;Toxicity Full&#8208;Color Carbon Dots with Wide Tunable High&#8208;Stable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703&#160;nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid&#8208;state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non&#8208;toxic, cost&#8208;effective, and highly&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full&#8208;color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B&#8208;CDs, G&#8208;CDs, Y&#8208;CDs, R&#8208;CDs, and NIR&#8208;CDs) fluorescence through cross&#8208;linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled.

&lt;p&gt;This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic-scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR-SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long-term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid-scale all-vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low-cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy-induced physicochemical properties on vanadium-redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic-scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest-coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/V&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; couple and expedite its round-tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long-term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation-vacancy-functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000-cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, outclassing others.

         <title>Regulating the Isomerization Geometry and Energy State of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3&#8208;substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (&#916;E), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#945; with 2,2&#8208;substitution, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#946;&#946; with 3,3&#8208;substitution, and Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with 2,3&#8208;substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

         <title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton&#8208;Mediated Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An etchless bound&#8208;state&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton&#8208;exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off&#8208;cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (&#947;&#8208;InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton&#8208;photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton&#8208;exciton scattering process, which is not observable off&#8208;cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self&#8208;enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro&#8208;inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro&#8208;inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune&#8208;inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls&#8208;Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth&#8208;abundant widely&#8208;used non&#8208;reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls&#8208;assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely&#8208;used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide&#8208;anchored copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen&#8208;species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

Herein, a nonreducible oxide-anchored copper single-atom catalyst (Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen-species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Gelatin Hydrogel Scaffold with Drug Loading Remodels the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Enhance Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10&#160;MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross&#8208;linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained&#8208;release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10&#160;MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug&#8208;loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation&#8208;induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure&#8208;properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium&#8208;MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light&#8208;driven processes mainly due to their ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure&#8208;properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff&#8208;base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.

         <title>Magnetointeractive Cr2Te3&#8208;Coated Liquid Metal Droplets for Flexible Memory Arrays and Wearable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single object with dual properties &#8211; degradable and non&#8208;degradable &#8211; is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi&#8208;material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi&#8208;material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi&#8208;material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties &#8211; typically hard versus soft &#8211; and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi&#8208;material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength&#8208;differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual&#8208;wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio&#8208;temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway&#8208;independent wavelength&#8208;orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi&#8208;wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths &#8211; each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction &#8211; are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi&#8208;material objects with degradable and non&#8208;degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Silk&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Spatially Targeted Delivery and Osteochondral Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gradient silk&#8208;based hydrogel is developed via an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven method to enhance osteochondral regeneration. By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site&#8208;specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946;1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load&#8208;bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk&#8208;based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual&#8208;gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects, the dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

         <title>Toward High&#8208;Performance, Flexible, Photo&#8208;Assisted All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries: Screening of Solid&#8208;Polymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes Coupled with Photoelectrochemical Storage Cathodes</title>

Highly cycle&#8208;stable photo&#8208;assisted all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light&#8208;driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo&#8208;assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light&#8208;driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light&#8208;driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&#8722;1). Meanwhile, energy&#8208;level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch&#8208;type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice.

Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley&#8208;polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley&#8208;polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.
