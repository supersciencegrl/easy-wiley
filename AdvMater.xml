         <title>Unlocking Topological Effects in Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three fully conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinct topologies are designed and synthesized for efficient photocatalytic H2O2 production. The topological effects play a crucial role in regulating the charge carrier dynamics in COFs. The hxl topology significantly enhances charge separation and transport, achieving an unprecedented 1.41% efficiency for solar&#8208;driven photocatalytic H2O2 production in COF&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a compelling platform for the efficient photosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Constructed with diverse topologies from various molecular building units, COFs can exhibit unique photocatalytic properties. In this study, three &#960;&#8208;conjugated 2D sp2 carbon&#8208;linked COFs with distinctly different topologies (hcb, sql, and hxl) are designed to investigate the topological effect on the overall photosynthesis of H2O2 from water and oxygen. Despite their similar chemical and band structures, the QP&#8208;HPTP&#8208;COF with hxl topology outperformed other COFs in the photosynthesis of H2O2, demonstrating a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.41%. Comprehensive characterizations confirmed that the hxl topology can substantially improve charge separation and transfer, thereby significantly enhancing photocatalytic performance. This study not only unravels the topology&#8208;directed charge carrier dynamics in COFs but also establishes a molecular engineering framework for developing high&#8208;performance photocatalysts for sustainable H2O2 production.

         <title>Anisotropic Ferroelectricity in Polar Vortices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the existence and anisotropic nature of macroscopic polarization components that emerge within lattices of nanoscale polar vortices are demonstrated. In particular, the component parallel to the vortex axis shows novel switching behavior that can be harnessed for multistate memory, with excellent stability of numerous intermediate states demonstrated.








Abstract
The exotic polarization configurations of topologically protected dipolar textures have opened new avenues for realizing novel phenomena absent in traditional ferroelectric systems. While multiple recent studies have revealed a diverse array of emergent properties in such polar topologies, the details of their atomic and mesoscale structures remain incomplete. Through atomic&#8208; and meso&#8208;scale imaging techniques, the emergence of a macroscopic ferroelectric polarization along both principal axes of the vortex lattice while performing phase&#8208;field modeling to probe the atomic scale origins of these distinct polarization components is demonstrated. Additionally, due to the anisotropic epitaxial strain, the polarization switching behavior perpendicular and parallel to the vortices is highly anisotropic, with switching along the vortex axes occurring over numerous decades in field&#8208;pulse width. This slow switching process allows for the deterministic control of the polarization state, enabling a non&#8208;volatile, multi&#8208;state memory with excellent distinguishability and long retention&#160;times.

         <title>Enhanced Photosensitizer Wettability via Anchoring Competition of Violet Phosphorus Quantum Dots for Breakthroughs in Photodynamic Film Sterilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy to enhance the wettability of photosensitizers in photodynamic films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) by anchoring violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs). This approach effectively boosts the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and enhances antibacterial efficacy. Computational modeling and experimental findings demonstrate the promising potential of VP/Hy&#8208;BC films for applications in antibacterial packaging.








Abstract
Wettability is important for photodynamic film sterilization since higher wettability enhances the capture of bacteria in contact with photosensitizers. Herein, a small number of violet phosphorus quantum dots (VPQDs) are anchored into hypericin bacterial cellulose films (VP/Hy&#8208;BC films) to improve wettability, reducing the water contact angle from 56.8&#176; to 33.0&#176;. This modification facilitated more effective interactions between the bacteria and photosensitizers, rapidly inactivating 7 log10 CFU/mL of Staphylococcus aureus within 60&#160;min. First&#8208;principles calculations and molecular dynamics simulations reveal that VPQDs, with their low spatial site resistance, reduced the intermolecular Hy self&#8208;aggregation force. This increased the solvent&#8208;accessible surface area of VP/Hy by &#8776;25.7%, thereby decreasing hydrophobic photosensitizer aggregation. Consequently, more active sites are exposed, remarkably improving the photoelectron transfer efficiency. VP/Hy&#8208;BC demonstrated exceptional efficacy in inhibiting bacterial proliferation; for instance, it extended beef shelf life by up to 10 days. The findings of this study will aid the development of health&#8208;conscious, eco&#8208;friendly, and efficient antimicrobial packaging films.

         <title>Observation of Highly Spin&#8208;Polarized Dangling Bond Surface States in Rare&#8208;Earth Pnictide Tellurides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique type of surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting is realized. Spin ARPES measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, arising from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. This work presents an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, shedding lights on potential spintronic applications.








Abstract
To generate and manipulate spin&#8208;polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare&#8208;earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin&#8208;momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface&#8208;purified spin&#8208;orbital texture. The work extends the so&#8208;called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin&#8208;orbital&#8208;momentum&#8208;layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To generate and manipulate spin-polarized electronic states in solids are crucial for modern spintronics. The textbook routes employ quantum well states or Shockley/topological type surface states whose spin degeneracy is lifted by strong spin-orbit coupling and inversion symmetry breaking at the surface/interface. The resultant spin polarization is usually truncated because of the intertwining between multiple orbitals. Here a unique type of surface states is realized, namely, dangling bond surface states in a family of ternary rare-earth pnictide tellurides RePnTe (Re = La, Gd, Ce; Pn = Sb, Bi), with robust band structure and sizeable spin splitting. Spin and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements reveal high spin polarization and distinct spin-momentum locking texture, which, according to the theoretical analysis, arise from local site asymmetry and surface-purified spin-orbital texture. The work extends the so-called &#8220;hidden spin polarization&#8221; from the bulk to the surface, presenting an intriguing spin-orbital-momentum-layer locking phenomenon, which may shed lights on potential spintronic applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Transition Metal Network via Orbital Population Design Stabilizes Lattice Oxygen Redox in Stoichiometric Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered transition metal (TM) network is crucial for the activity and reversibility of lattice oxygen in batteries. A t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work establishes a promising pathway for developing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes by controlling TM ordering.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries employing stoichiometric layered Li metal oxides as cathodes are now reaching the energy density limits due to single cationic redox chemistry. Lattice oxygen redox (LOR) has been discovered in these materials, as a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density paradigm observed in Li&#8208;rich materials. Nevertheless, the origin of this process is not understood, preventing the rational design of better cathode materials. Here, employing stoichiometric Ni&#8208;based cathodes, it is demonstrated that LOR originates from a dynamic transition metal (TM) network caused by ion migration during the electrochemical process. This network is confirmed to be ribbon through both ex&#8208; and in&#8208;situ STEM observations, facilitating reversible LOR. Finally, a t2g orbital population rule is proposed to guide the design of ordered TM networks, supported by calculated structures and the synthesized ordered TM oxides reported. This work explains the mechanism of LOR in stoichiometric layered cathode materials, and sets a promising direction for the design of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density cathodes through the regulation of TM ordering.

         <title>Super Moisture&#8208;Sorbent Sponge for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting and Power Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable salt&#8208;based super moisture&#8208;sorbent sponge is developed by an integrated strategy using LiCl&#8208;dopamine chelation and dopamine polymerization on melamine sponge (PMS) to achieve rapid and high water uptake without leakage. A dual&#8208;function system is constructed by integrating the LiCl/PMS/CNTs with a thermoelectric module to realize simultaneous fresh water and electricity production, fully utilizing the low&#8208;grade heat from the absorption/desorption processes.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) shows great promise to mitigate the worldwide water scarcity, especially in the arid regions. Salt&#8208;based composite materials are the extensively used sorbents for SAWH, however, they suffer from complex preparation to avoid salt leakage. Furthermore, the significant amount of heat produced during water harvesting process is often neglected and wasted. Herein, an integrated strategy is developed to synthesis salt&#8208;based stable super moisture&#8208;sorbent sponge by using the chelation of LiCl and dopamine (DA), and the simultaneous polymerization of DA on melamine sponge (PMS). The as&#8208;prepared LiCl/PMS/CNTs showed high water uptake, reaching 1.26 and 1.81&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15% and 30% RH, respectively, and no salt leakage is observed during the water absorption process. Remarkable daily water production of 3.47&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 in an arid environment (30% RH) is achieved. Moreover, a dual&#8208;function system is successfully constructed by combining the LiCl/PMS/CNTs with a thermoelectric module to fully utilize the heat generated from the SAWH process, which can realize the simultaneous production of fresh water and electricity. The maximum output power density is up to 35.4 and 454.4&#160;mW m&#8722;2 during the water absorption and desorption process, respectively.

         <title>Viscoelastic High&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Hyaluronic Acid Hydrogels Support Rapid Glioblastoma Cell Invasion with Leader&#8211;Follower Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glioblastoma spheroids invade faster in stress&#8208;relaxing, high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (HMW) hyaluronic acid hydrogels than in more elastic&#8208;like, low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight counterparts. The long HMW chains create entanglement&#8208;based crosslinks capable of viscous dissipation that cells rearrange to facilitate invasion. While invading, cells leave a trail of hyaluronidase&#8208;2 (HYAL2) in their wake to prime a path for the advancement of follower cells and thus rapid invasion.








Abstract
Hyaluronic acid (HA), the primary component of brain extracellular matrix, is increasingly used to model neuropathological processes, including glioblastoma (GBM) tumor invasion. While elastic hydrogels based on crosslinked low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight (LMW) HA are widely exploited for this purpose and have proven valuable for discovery and screening, brain tissue is both viscoelastic and rich in high&#8208;MW (HMW) HA, and it remains unclear how these differences influence invasion. To address this question, hydrogels comprised of either HMW (1.5 MDa) or LMW (60 kDa) HA are introduced, characterized, and applied in GBM invasion studies. Unlike LMW HA hydrogels, HMW HA hydrogels relax stresses quickly, to a similar extent as brain tissue, and to a greater extent than many conventional HA&#8208;based scaffolds. GBM cells implanted within HMW HA hydrogels invade much more rapidly than in their LMW HA counterparts and exhibit distinct leader&#8211;follower dynamics. Leader cells adopt dendritic morphologies similar to invasive GBM cells observed in vivo. Transcriptomic, pharmacologic, and imaging studies suggest that leader cells exploit hyaluronidase, an enzyme strongly enriched in human GBMs, to prime a path for followers. This study offers new insight into how HA viscoelastic properties drive invasion and argues for the use of highly stress&#8208;relaxing materials to model GBM.

         <title>Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptor Clustering by Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Play Nanotools</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates T cell receptor (TCR) clustering, a crucial process for immune signaling. Using engineered nanotools, the authors controlled TCR clustering in ligand&#8208;induced and ligand&#8208;free conditions. They found different dynamics of the two modalities, suggesting the importance of ligand size and architecture.

T&#160;cell receptor (TCR) clustering and formation of an immune synapse are crucial for TCR signaling. However, limited information is available about these dynamic assemblies and their connection to transmembrane signaling. In this work, TCR clustering is controlled via plug&#8208;and&#8208;play nanotools based on an engineered irreversible conjugation pair and a peptide&#8208;loaded major histocompatibility complex (pMHC) molecule to compare receptor assembly in a ligand (pMHC)&#8208;induced or ligand&#8208;independent manner. A streptavidin&#8208;binding peptide displayed in both tools enabled their anchoring in streptavidin&#8208;pre&#8208;structured matrices. Strikingly, pMHC&#8208;induced clustering in the confined regions exhibit higher density and dynamics than the ligand&#8208;free approach, indicating that the size and architecture of the pMHC ligand influences TCR assembly. This approach enables the control of membrane receptor clustering with high specificity and provides the possibility to explore different modalities of receptor activation.

&lt;p&gt;The study investigates T cell receptor (TCR) clustering, a crucial process for immune signaling. Using engineered nanotools, the authors controlled TCR clustering in ligand-induced and ligand-free conditions. They found different dynamics of the two modalities, suggesting the importance of ligand size and architecture. This method offers precise control over receptor clustering, facilitating exploration of receptor activation.

         <title>Percutaneous Delivery of Oncogel for Targeted Liver Tumor Ablation and Controlled Release of Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injectable Oncogel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid, chemotherapy, and a checkpoint inhibitor for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation with long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone is developed. Intratumoral injection of OG can potentially augment immunotherapy and improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.








Abstract
Advanced&#8208;stage liver cancers are associated with poor prognosis and have limited treatment options, often leading the patient to hospice care. Percutaneous intratumoral injection of anticancer agents has emerged as a potential alternative to systemic therapy to overcome tumor barriers, increase bioavailability, potentiate immunotherapy, and avoid systemic toxicity, which advanced&#8208;stage cancer patients cannot tolerate. Here, an injectable OncoGel (OG) comprising of a nanocomposite hydrogel loaded with an ionic liquid (IL) is developed for achieving a predictable and uniform tumor ablation and long&#8208;term slow release of anticancer agents into the ablation zone. Rigorous mechanical, physiochemical, drug release, cytotoxicity experiments, and ex vivo human tissue testing identify an injectable version of the OG with bactericidal properties against highly resistant bacteria. Intratumoral injection of OG loaded with Nivolumab (Nivo) and doxorubicin (Dox) into highly malignant tumor models in mice, rats, and rabbits demonstrates enhanced survival and tumor regression associated with robust tissue ablation and drug distribution throughout the tumor. Mass cytometry and proteomic studies in a mouse model of colorectal cancer that often metastasizes to the liver indicate an enhanced anticancer immune response following the intratumoral injection of OG. OG may augment immunotherapy and potentially improve outcomes in liver cancer patients.

         <title>Janus Swarm Metamaterials for Information Display, Memory, and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoactive Janus particles (MAJPs) with engineered functional compartments provide tunable structures and properties that enable fast swarming response, remote actuation, and advanced functions in electronics&#8208;free configurations. MAJPs are implemented in swarm metamaterials with programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices.








Abstract
Metamaterials are emerging as an unconventional platform to perform computing abstractions in physical systems by processing environmental stimuli into information. While computation functions have been demonstrated in mechanical systems, they rely on compliant mechanisms to achieve predefined states, which impose inherent design restrictions that limit their miniaturization, deployment, reconfigurability, and functionality. Here, a metamaterial system is described based on responsive magnetoactive Janus particle (MAJP) swarms with multiple programmable functions. MAJPs are designed with tunable structure and properties in mind, that is, encoded swarming behavior and fully reversible switching mechanisms, to enable programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices. MAJPs and their unique swarming behavior open new functions for the design of multifunctional and reconfigurable display devices, and constitute a promising building block to develop the next generation of soft physical computing devices, with growing applications in security, defense, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, camouflage, soft robotics, and human&#8208;robot interaction.

         <title>Flexible Crossbar Molecular Devices with Patterned EGaIn Top Electrodes for Integrated All&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Circuit Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach for the design of flexible molecular devices is presented here. The devices with patterned liquid metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes exhibit excellent charge transport performance and stable retention properties. Functional all&#8208;molecule&#8208;circuits including Boolean logic gates and rectifier circuits are achieved by the devices.








Abstract
Here, a unique crossbar architecture is designed and fabricated, incorporating vertically integrated self&#8208;assembled monolayers in electronic devices. This architecture is used to showcase 100 individual vertical molecular junctions on a single chip with a high yield of working junctions and high device uniformity. The study introduces a transfer approach for patterned liquid&#8208;metal eutectic alloy of gallium and indium top electrodes, enabling the creation of fully flexible molecular devices with electrical functionalities. The devices exhibit excellent charge transport performance, sustain a high rectification ratio (&gt;103), and stable endurance and retention properties, even when the devices are significantly bent. Furthermore, Boolean logic gates, including OR and AND gates, as well as half&#8208;wave and full&#8208;wave rectifying circuits, are successfully implemented. The unique design of the flexible molecular device represents a significant step in harnessing the potential of molecular devices for high&#8208;density integration and possible molecule&#8208;based computing.

         <title>Robust Chiral Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Coatings for Self&#8208;Activating and Sustainable Biofouling Mitigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel &#8220;dispense&#8208;then&#8208;kill&#8221; anti&#8208;biofouling strategy is developed via copper&#8208;D&#8208;amino acid metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) coatings with precisely controlled structural symmetries. An intermediate adhesive layer comprising amorphous metal&#8208;polyphenol networks ensures robust and uniform deployment of MOF nanoarmors. This chiral coating can significantly reduce bacterial or microalgae biofilm attachment and eradicate a broad spectrum of mature biofilms through synergistic active defensive mechanisms.








Abstract
Surface coatings are designed to mitigate pervasive biofouling herald, a new era of surface protection in complex biological environments. However, existing strategies are plagued by persistent and recurrent biofilm attachment, despite the use of bactericidal agents. Herein, a chiral metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based coating with conformal microstructures to enable a new anti&#8208;biofouling mode that involves spontaneous biofilm disassembly followed by bacterial eradication is developed. A facile and universal metal&#8208;polyphenol network (MPN) is designed to robustly anchor the MOF nanoarmor of biocidal Cu2+ ions and anti&#8208;biofilm d&#8208;amino acid ligands to a variety of substrates across different material categories and surface topologies. Incorporating a diverse array of chiral amino acids endows the resultant coatings with widespread signals for biofilm dispersal, facilitating copper&#8208;catalyzed chemodynamic reactions and inherent mechano&#8208;bactericidal activities. This synergistic mechanism yields unprecedented anti&#8208;biofouling efficacy elucidated by RNA&#8208;sequencing transcriptomics analysis, enhancing broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities, preventing biofilm formation, and destroying mature biofilms. Additionally, the chelation&#8208;directed amorphous/crystalline coatings can activate photoluminescent properties to inhibit the settlement of microalgae biofilms. This study provides a distinctive perspective on chirality&#8208;enhanced antimicrobial behaviors and pioneers a rational pathway toward developing next&#8208;generation anti&#8208;biofouling coatings for diverse applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (HEMOFs): A New Frontier in Materials Design for CO2 Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) are synthesized with up to 15 distinct metals, representing an unprecedented level of complexity for MOFs. A suite of complementary characterization techniques and density functional theory&#160;calculations unravel the metal distributions in the materials; well&#8208;mixed heterometallic clusters are directly visualized by high resolution microscopy tools. The HEMOFs are highly active for CO2 epoxidation under mild conditions.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy materials (HEMs) emerged as promising candidates for a diverse array of chemical transformations, including CO2 utilization. However, traditional HEMs catalysts are nonporous, limiting their activity to surface sites. Designing HEMs with intrinsic porosity can open the door toward enhanced reactivity while maintaining the many benefits of high configurational entropy. Here, a synergistic experimental, analytical, and theoretical approach to design the first high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) derived from polynuclear metal clusters is implemented, a novel class of porous HEMs that is highly active for CO2 fixation under mild conditions and short reaction times, outperforming existing heterogeneous catalysts. HEMOFs with up to 15 distinct metals are synthesized (the highest number of metals ever incorporated into a single MOF) and, for the first time, homogenous metal mixing within individual clusters is directly observed via high&#8208;resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy. Importantly, density functional theory studies provide unprecedented insight into the electronic structures of HEMOFs, demonstrating that the density of states in heterometallic clusters is highly sensitive to metal composition. This work dramatically advances HEMOF materials design, paving the way for further exploration of HEMs and offers new avenues for the development of multifunctional materials with tailored properties for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Pyridinic/Pyrrolic N Enabling N/S Co&#8208;Doped Holey Graphene with Accelerated Kinetics for Alkali&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide, which delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1) and robust cyclic stability as anodes for K&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials hold great promise for K&#8208;ion batteries due to their low cost, adjustable interlayer spacing, and high electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, the narrow interlayer spacing significantly restricts their potassium storage ability. Herein, hierarchical N, S co&#8208;doped exfoliated holey graphene (NSEHG) with ultrahigh pyridinic/pyrrolic N (90.6&#160;at.%) and large interlayer spacing (0.423&#160;nm) is prepared through micro&#8208;explosion assisted thermal exfoliation of graphene oxide (GO). The underlying mechanism of the micro&#8208;explosive exfoliation of GO is revealed. The NSEHG electrode delivers a remarkable reversible capacity (621 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A&#160;g&#8722;1), outstanding rate capability (155 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 10 A&#160;g&#8722;1), and robust cyclic stability (0.005% decay per cycle after 4400 cycles at 5 A&#160;g&#8722;1), exceeding most of the previously reported graphene anodes in K&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, the NSEHG electrode exhibits encouraging performances as anodes for Li&#8208;/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Furthermore, the assembled activated carbon||NSEHG potassium&#8208;ion hybrid capacitor can deliver an impressive energy density of 141 Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance with 96.1% capacitance retention after 4000 cycles at 1 A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work can offer helpful fundamental insights into design and scalable fabrication of high&#8208;performance graphene anodes for alkali metal ion batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Factor&#8208;Controlled Dynamic Precursors Enable On&#8208;Demand Thermoset Degradation and Recycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversibility of the integrated dynamic bond, controlled by two factors, can be triggered under mild and specific conditions. When this reversibility is deactivated, the resulting network polymers exhibit life&#8208;span stability. Conversely, when the reversibility is activated by applying both control factors, the polymers offer easy and on&#8208;demand degradability and recyclability.








Abstract
Thermosets are well known for their advantages such as high stability and chemical resistance. However, developing sustainable thermosets with degradability and recyclability faces several principal challenges, including reconciling the desired characteristics during service with the recycling and reprocessing properties required at the end of life, establishing efficient methods for large&#8208;scale synthesis, and aligning with current manufacturing process. Here a general strategy is presented for the on&#8208;demand degradation and recycling of thermosets under mild conditions utilizing dynamic precursors with dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled reversibility. Specifically, dynamic triazine crosslinkers are introduced through dynamic nucleophilic aromatic substitution (SNAr) into the precursor polyols used in polyurethane (PU) synthesis. Upon removal of the catalyst and alcohol, the reversibility of SNAr is deactivated, allowing for the use of standard PU polymerization techniques such as injection molding, casting, and foaming. The resulting cyanurate&#8208;crosslinked PUs maintain high stability and diverse mechanical properties of traditional crosslinked PUs, yet offer the advantage of easy on&#8208;demand depolymerization for recycling by activating the reversibility of SNAr under specific but mild conditions&#8212;a combination of base, alcohol, and mild heat. It is envisioned that this approach, involving the pre&#8208;installation of dual&#8208;factor&#8208;controlled dynamic crosslinkers, can be broadly applied to current thermosetting plastic manufacturing processes, introducing enhanced&#160;sustainability.

         <title>Flexible Temperature Sensor with High Reproducibility and Wireless Closed&#8208;Loop System for Decoupled Multimodal Health Monitoring and Personalized Thermoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, achieving high reproducibility, more reliable sensitivity, and higher stability; it also has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A textile&#8208;based flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system is designed to monitor health status and autonomously regulate body temperature.








Abstract
Temperature and pulse waves are two fundamental indicators of body health. Specifically, thermoresistive flexible temperature sensors are one of the most applied sensors. However, they suffer from poor reproducibility of resistivity; and decoupling temperature from pressure/strain is still challenging. Besides, autonomous thermoregulation by wearable sensory systems is in high demand, but conventional commercial apparatuses are cumbersome and not suitable for long&#8208;term portable use. Here, a material&#8208;design strategy is developed to overcome the problem of poor reproducibility of resistivity by tuning the thermal expansion coefficient to nearly zero, precluding the detriment caused by shape expansion/shrinkage with temperature variation and achieving high reproducibility. The strategy also obtains more reliable sensitivity and higher stability, and the designed thermoresistive fiber has strain&#8208;insensitive sensing performance and fast response/recovery time. A smart textile woven by the thermoresistive fiber can decouple temperature and pulse without crosstalk; and a flexible wireless closed&#8208;loop system comprising the smart textile, a heating textile, a flexible diminutive control patch, and a smartphone is designed and constructed to monitor health status in real&#8208;time and autonomously regulate body temperature. This work offers a new route to circumvent temperature&#8208;sensitive effects for flexible sensors and new insights for personalized thermoregulation.

To address the dilemma between color purity and device lifetime for blue TADF emitters, synergistic intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions demonstrate great capability to enable robust pure&#8208;blue TADF emitters. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF material simultaneously exhibits the highest C&#9472;N BDE among blue TADF materials and desired photophysical performances, realizing record&#8208;high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 109&#160;h with CIEy = 0.16 and 81&#160;h with CIEy = 0.10.








Abstract
Stability&#8208;issues of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) employing thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) require further advancements, especially in pure&#8208;blue range of CIEy &lt; 0.20, existing a dilemma between color purity and device lifetime. Though improving bond&#8208;dissociation&#8208;energy (BDE) can effectively improve material intrinsic stability, strategies to simultaneously improve BDE and photophysical performances are still lacking. Herein, it is disclosed that synergistic intramolecular non&#8208;covalent interactions (Intra&#8208;NI) can achieve not only the highest C&#9472;N BDE among blue TADF materials, but enhanced molecular&#8208;rigidity, near&#8208;unity photoluminescent quantum yields and short delayed lifetime. Pure&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;OLEDs based on proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept TADF material realize high external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency and record&#8208;high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 109&#160;h with CIEy = 0.16. Furthermore, deep&#8208;blue TADF&#8208;sensitized devices exhibit high LT80@500&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 of 81&#160;h with CIEy = 0.10. The findings provide new insight into the critical role of Intra&#8208;NI in OLED materials and open the way to tackling vexing stability issues for developing robust pure&#8208;blue organic emitters and other functional materials.

         <title>Regulating the Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction Performance with Controllable Distribution of Unconventional Phase Copper on Alloy Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unconventional phase 2H Cu is synthesized through epitaxial growth on hcp IrNi template, and the distribution of 2H Cu can be well regulated by controlling reaction time, resulting in three kinds of IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures. Notably, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 with low Cu coverage demonstrates superior ammonia yield rate toward nitrate electroreduction, which is 3.6 times that of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 with high Cu coverage.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is emerging as a promising strategy for nitrate removal and ammonia (NH3) production using renewable electricity. Although great progresses have been achieved, the crystal phase effect of electrocatalysts on NO3RR remains rarely explored. Here, the epitaxial growth of unconventional 2H Cu on hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) IrNi template, resulting in the formation of three IrNiCu@Cu nanostructures, is reported. IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 shows superior catalytic performance, with NH3 Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 86% at &#8722;0.1 (vs reversible hydrogen electrode [RHE]) and NH3 yield rate of 687.3&#160;mmol gCu&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, far better than common face&#8208;centered cubic Cu. In sharp contrast, IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;30 and IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;50 covered by hcp Cu shell display high selectivity toward nitrite (NO2&#8722;), with NO2&#8722; FE above 60% at 0.1 (vs RHE). Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 has the optimal electronic structures for NO3RR due to the highest d&#8208;band center and strongest reaction trend with the lowest energy barriers. The high electroactivity of IrNiCu@Cu&#8208;20 originates from the abundant low coordination of Cu sites on the surface, which guarantees the fast electron transfer to accelerate the intermediate conversions. This work provides a feasible tactic to regulate the product distribution of NO3RR by crystal phase engineering of electrocatalysts.

         <title>K&#8208;Rich Spinel Interface of Air&#8208;Stable Layered Oxide Cathodes for Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With layered oxide powders immersed in water, the K+ in the bulk phase is partially dissolved in water and accumulates on the surface of the particles. At a high K+ content, the layered phase on the surface is in situ converted into the spinel phase, which exhibits improved surface stability against air and maintains electrochemical stability in an ambient environment.








Abstract
Potassium&#8208;containing transition metal layered oxides (KxTmO2), although possessing high energy density and suitable operating voltage, suffer from severe hygroscopic properties due to their two dimensional (2D)&#160;layered structure. Their air sensitivity compromises structural stability during prolonged air exposure, therefore increasing the cost. The common sense for designing air&#8208;stable layered cathode materials is to avoid contact with H2O&#160;molecules. In this study, it is surprisingly found that P3&#8208;type KxTmO2 forms an ultra&#8208;thin, potassium&#8208;rich spinel phase wrapping layer after simply water immersion, remarkedly reduces the reaction activity of the material's surface with air. Combined with Density Function Theory (DFT) calculations, this spinel phase is found to be able to effectively withstand air deterioration and preserving the crystal structure. Consequently, the water&#8208;treated material, when exposed to air, can largely maintain its good electrochemical performance, with capacity retention up to 99.15% compared to the fresh samples. Such an in situ surface phase transformation mechanism is also corroborated in other KxTmO2, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing the air stability of P3&#8208;type layered oxides for K+ storage.

         <title>Synergistic Performance of Thermoelectric and Mechanical in Nanotwinned High&#8208;Entropy Semiconductors AgMnGePbSbTe5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing the configurational entropy to reduce the stacking fault energy, dense nanotwins in a new high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 are obtained. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries provide efficient phonon scattering and dislocation pinning, leading to a high ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and robust mechanical properties with a flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV at room temperature.








Abstract
Introducing nanotwins in thermoelectric materials represents a promising approach to achieving such a synergistic combination of thermoelectric properties and mechanical properties. By increasing configurational entropy, a sharply reduced stacking fault energy in a new nanotwinned high&#8208;entropy semiconductor AgMnGePbSbTe5 is reached. Dense coherent nanotwin boundaries in this system provide an efficient phonon scattering barrier, leading to a high figure of merit ZT of &#8776;2.46 at 750&#160;K and a high average ZT of &#8776;1.54 (300&#8212;823&#160;K) with the presence of Ag2Te nanoprecipitate in the sample. More importantly, owing to the dislocation pinning caused by coherent nanotwin boundaries and the chemical short&#8208;range disorder caused by the high configurational entropy effect, AgMnGePbSbTe5 also exhibits robust mechanical properties, with flexural strength of 82&#160;MPa and Vickers hardness of 210&#160;HV.

         <title>Extended Surface Bands Enabled Lasing Emission and Wavelength Switch from Sulfur Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extended surface band&#8208;enabled lasing emission has been realized from sulfur quantum dots. The reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain of sulfur quantum dots allows for the demonstration of lasing wavelength switching using a single inorganic gain material.








Abstract
The development of a lasing wavelength switch, particularly from a single inorganic gain material, is challenging but highly demanded for advanced photonics. Nonetheless, all current lasing emission of inorganic gain materials arises from band&#8208;edge states, and the inherent fixed bandgap limitation of the band&#8208;edge system leads to the inaccessibility of lasing wavelength switching from a single inorganic gain material. Here the realization of a single inorganic gain material&#8208;based lasing wavelength switch is reported by proposing an alternative lasing emission strategy, that is, lasing emission from surface gain. Previous efforts to achieve surface&#8208;gain&#8208;enabled lasing emission have been hindered by the limited gain volume provided by surface states due to the broad emission bandwidth and/or low emission efficiency. This challenge is overcome by introducing extended surface bands onto the surface of sulfur quantum dots. The extended surface bands contribute to a high photoluminescence quantum yield and narrow emission bandwidth, thereby providing sufficient gain volume and facilitating stimulated emission. When combined with whispering gallery mode microcavity, surface gain enabled lasing emission manifests an ultralow threshold of 8.3 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the reconfigurable perturbation to surface gain, facilitated by molecular affinity, allows for the realization of the lasing wavelength switch from a single inorganic gain material.

         <title>Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Employing Doublet Sensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in a new device concept, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.3&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) exciton utilization enables high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7%.








Abstract
Fast and efficient exciton utilization is a crucial solution and highly desirable for achieving high&#8208;performance blue organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, the rate and efficiency of exciton utilization in traditional OLEDs, which employ fully closed&#8208;shell materials as emitters, are inevitably limited by spin statistical limitations and transition prohibition. Herein, a new sensitization strategy, namely doublet&#8208;sensitized fluorescence (DSF), is proposed to realize high&#8208;performance deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence. In the DSF&#8208;OLED, a doublet&#8208;emitting cerium(III) complex, Ce&#8208;2, is utilized as sensitizer for multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence emitter &#957;&#8208;DABNA. Experimental results reveal that holes and electrons predominantly recombine on Ce&#8208;2 to form doublet excitons, which subsequently transfer energy to the singlet state of &#957;&#8208;DABNA via exceptionally fast (over 108&#160;s&#8722;1) and efficient (&#8776;100%) F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer for deep&#8208;blue emission. Due to the circumvention of spin&#8208;flip in the DSF mechanism, near&#8208;unit exciton utilization efficiency and remarkably short exciton residence time of 1.36&#160;&#181;s are achieved in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept deep&#8208;blue DSF&#8208;OLED, which achieves a Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinate of (0.13, 0.14), a high external quantum efficiency of 30.0%, and small efficiency roll&#8208;off of 14.7% at a luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2. The DSF device exhibits significantly improved operational stability compared with unsensitized reference device.

         <title>Flexible Artificial Tactility with Excellent Robustness and Temperature Tolerance Based on Organohydrogel Sensor Array for Robot Motion Detection and Object Shape Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The robust and flexible artificial tactility enabled by a tough, low&#8208;hysteresis organohydrogel sensor array ensures precise detection of robot motion and external pressure over broad temperature range. Further bolstered by machine learning, robot tactility achieves accurate recognition of grasped objects, thereby expanding the potential application areas of novel intelligent robots.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based flexible artificial tactility is equipped to intelligent robots to mimic human mechanosensory perception. However, it remains a great challenge for hydrogel sensors to maintain flexibility and sensory performances during cyclic loadings at high or low temperatures due to water loss or freezing. Here, a flexible robot tactility is developed with high robustness based on organohydrogel sensor arrays with negligent hysteresis and temperature tolerance. Conductive polyaniline chains are interpenetrated through a poly(acrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) network with glycerin/water mixture with interchain electrostatic interactions and hydrogen bonds, yielding a high dissipated energy of 1.58&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, and ultralow hysteresis during 1000 cyclic loadings. Moreover, the binary solvent provides the gels with outstanding tolerance from &#8722;100 to 60&#160;&#176;C and the organohydrogel sensors remain flexible, fatigue resistant, conductive (0.27 S m&#8722;1), highly strain sensitive (GF of 3.88) and pressure sensitive (35.8 MPa&#8722;1). The organohydrogel sensor arrays are equipped on manipulator finger dorsa and pads to simultaneously monitor the finger motions and detect the pressure distribution exerted by grasped objects. A machine learning model is used to train the system to recognize the shape of grasped objects with 100% accuracy. The flexible robot tactility based on organohydrogels is promising for novel intelligent robots.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Derived 0D Perovskite Induced Surface Lattice Arrangement for Efficient and Stable All&#8208;Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted CsPbI3 PSCs treated with inorganic&#8208;derived 0D Cs4PbBr6 perovskite nanocrystals show improved surface lattice arrangement, achieving a PCE of 21.03% and maintaining 92.48% stability after 1000&#160;h under 1&#8208;sun and damp heat conditions. Additionally, a module with a 64&#160;cm2 aperture area demonstrates a PCE of 17.39%.








Abstract
The inverted inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are prospective candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaics owing to inherent robust thermal/photo&#8208;stability and compatibility for tandems. However, the performance and stability of the inverted CsPbI3 PSCs fall behind the n&#8208;i&#8208;p counterparts due to poor energetic alignment and abundant interfacial defect states. Here, an inorganic 0D Cs4PbBr6 with a good lattice strain arrangement is implemented as the surface anchoring capping layer on CsPbI3. The Cs4PbBr6 perovskite induces enhanced electron&#8208;selective junction and thus facilitates efficient charge extraction and effectively inhibits non&#8208;radiative recombination. Consequently, the CsPbI3 PSCs with Cs4PbBr6 demonstrate the highest power conversion efficiency (PCE) of CsPbI3&#8208;based inverted PSCs, reaching 21.03% PCE from a unit cell and 17.39% PCE from a module with a 64 cm2 aperture area. Furthermore, the resulting devices retain 92.48% after 1000&#160;h under simultaneous 1&#8208;sun and damp heat (85&#160;&#176;C / 85% relative humidity) environment.

         <title>Biomedical&#8208;Optical&#8208;Window Tailored Cyanines for Steerable Inflammatory Bowel Disease Theranostic</title>

Heptamethine cyanines with customizable absorption wavelengths are presented in this work. Utilizing an IBD sensitive dyes pair, a photothermal dye with 810&#160;nm absorption and its fluorescent counterpart with 800&#160;nm emission, steerable IBD theranostic non&#8208;invasively is realized.








Abstract
Tailored photophysical properties and chemical activity is the ultimate pursuit of functional dyes for in vivo biomedical theranostics. In this work, the independent regulation of the absorption and fluorescence emission wavelengths of heptamethine cyanines is reported. These dyes retain near&#8208;infrared fluorescence emission (except a nitro&#8208;modified dye) while feature variable absorption wavelengths ranging from 590 to 860&#160;nm. This enables to obtain customized functional dyes that meet the excitation and fluorescence wavelength requirements defined by the optical properties of tissues for in vivo biomedical applications. Typically, a nitro&#8208;modified photothermal active derivative Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 is used, which features strong absorption at 810&#160;nm in PBS, a wavelength that balanced the tissue penetration depth and non&#8208;specific photothermal effect, to realize non&#8208;destructive inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) therapy via photothermal induced up&#8208;regulation of heat shock protein 70 in the intestinal epithelial cells. The corresponding amino&#8208;modified dye Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, which can be formed in health enteric cavity by Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 after oral administration, is a fluorescence compound with the emission of 800&#160;nm in PBS. Based on the IBD sensitive transformation of Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9 and Cy&#8208;Mu&#8208;7&#8208;9&#8208;NH2, in vivo IBD theranostic and therapeutic effect evaluation is realized via the synergy of fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy for the first time.

         <title>Spin Manipulation of Heterogeneous Molecular Electrocatalysts by an Integrated Magnetic Field for Efficient Oxygen Redox Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external magnetic field can influence the oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) activity of paramagnetic heterogeneous molecular electrocatalysts, providing a new strategy for understanding spin&#8208;dependent electrochemical processes.








Abstract
Understanding the spin&#8208;dependent activity of nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single metal atom (M&#8208;N&#8208;C) electrocatalysts for oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR and OER) remains challenging due to the lack of structure&#8208;defined catalysts and effective spin manipulation tools. Herein, both challenges using a magnetic field integrated heterogeneous molecular electrocatalyst prepared by anchoring cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) deposited carbon black on polymer&#8208;protected magnet nanoparticles, are addressed. The built&#8208;in magnetic field can shift the Co center from low&#8208; to high&#8208;spin (HS) state without atomic structure modification, affording one&#8208;order higher turnover frequency, a 50% increased H2O2 selectivity for ORR, and a &#8776;4000% magnetocurrent enhancement for OER. This catalyst can significantly minimize magnet usage, enabling safe and continuous production of a pure H2O2 solution for 100 h from a 100 cm2 electrolyzer. The new strategy demonstrated here also applies to other metal phthalocyanine&#8208;based catalysts, offering a universal platform for studying spin&#8208;related electrochemical processes.

         <title>Depth&#8208;Resolved X&#8208;Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy Evidence of Intrinsic Polar States in HfO2&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The discovery of ferroelectricity in hafnia&#8208;based films has reignited interest in understanding the emergence of ferroelectric properties at the nanoscale. Using depth&#8208;resolved X&#8208;ray photo&#8208;electron spectroscopy, electrochemical states in pre&#8208;determined polarization states of epitaxial Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) and Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO) films on SrTiO3|La0.67Sr0.33MnO3 (STO|LSMO) are compared. More pronounced electrochemical changes are revealed in films with lower polarization, evidencing an intrinsic polar state.








Abstract
The discovery of ferroelectricity in nanoscale hafnia&#8208;based oxide films has spurred interest in understanding their emergent properties. Investigation focuses on the size&#8208;dependent polarization behavior, which is sensitive to content and movement of oxygen vacancies. Though polarization switching and electrochemical reactions is shown to co&#8208;occur, their relationship remains unclear. This study employs X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy with depth sensitivity to examine changes in electrochemical states occurring during polarization switching. Contrasting Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) with Hf0.88La0.04Ta0.08O2 (HLTO), a composition with an equivalent structure and comparable average ionic radius, electrochemical states are directly observed for specific polarization directions. Lower&#8208;polarization films exhibit more significant electrochemical changes upon switching, suggesting an indirect relationship between polarization and electrochemical state. This research illuminates the complex interplay between polarization and electrochemical dynamics, providing evidence for intrinsic polar states in HfO2&#8208;based&#160;ferroelectrics.

         <title>Boosting the Efficiency of Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells via Enhanced Near&#8208;Infrared Absorption and Minimized Energy Losses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A diffusion&#8208;regulated ternary structure containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors enhances the absorption in the near&#8208;infrared region. By integration with wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcells, a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% is achieved in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.








Abstract
The compatibility of perovskite and organic photovoltaic materials in solution processing provides a significant advantage in the fabrication of high&#8208;efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. However, additional recombination losses can occur during exciton dissociation in organic materials, leading to energy losses in the near&#8208;infrared region of tandem devices. Consequently, a ternary organic rear subcell is designed containing two narrow&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to enhance the absorption of near&#8208;infrared light. Simultaneously, a unique diffusion&#8208;controlled growth technique is adopted to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layer, thereby improving exciton dissociation efficiency. This innovation not only broadens the absorption range of near&#8208;infrared light but also facilitates the generation and effective dissociation of excitons. Owing to these technological improvements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells increased to 19.2%. Furthermore, a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite front subcell is integrated with a narrow&#8208;bandgap organic rear subcell to develop a perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. Owing to the reduction in near&#8208;infrared energy loss, the PCE of this tandem device significantly improved, reaching 24.5%.

     alt="Boosting the Efficiency of Perovskite/Organic Tandem Solar Cells via Enhanced Near-Infrared Absorption and Minimized Energy Losses"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A diffusion-regulated ternary structure containing two narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors enhances the absorption in the near-infrared region. By integration with wide-bandgap perovskite front subcells, a power conversion efficiency of 24.5% is achieved in perovskite/organic tandem solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compatibility of perovskite and organic photovoltaic materials in solution processing provides a significant advantage in the fabrication of high-efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells. However, additional recombination losses can occur during exciton dissociation in organic materials, leading to energy losses in the near-infrared region of tandem devices. Consequently, a ternary organic rear subcell is designed containing two narrow-bandgap non-fullerene acceptors to enhance the absorption of near-infrared light. Simultaneously, a unique diffusion-controlled growth technique is adopted to optimize the morphology of the ternary active layer, thereby improving exciton dissociation efficiency. This innovation not only broadens the absorption range of near-infrared light but also facilitates the generation and effective dissociation of excitons. Owing to these technological improvements, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells increased to 19.2%. Furthermore, a wide-bandgap perovskite front subcell is integrated with a narrow-bandgap organic rear subcell to develop a perovskite/organic tandem solar cell. Owing to the reduction in near-infrared energy loss, the PCE of this tandem device significantly improved, reaching 24.5%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Buried Interface Strategies with Covalent Organic Frameworks for High&#8208;Performance Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor covalent organic frameworks are developed to control the perovskite energy level and defects at the buried interface of inverted devices. The power conversion efficiency is improved to 25.68% for conventional bandgap devices and 22.92% for wide&#8208;bandgap devices. Additionally, these cells demonstrated excellent stability, establishing a solid foundation for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Simultaneously controlling defects and film morphology at the buried interface is a promising approach to improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Here, two new donor&#8210;acceptor type semiconductive covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are developed, COFTPA and COFICZ. The carefully designed COFs structure not only effectively regulates the morphology and defects of the buried interface film, but also realizes the alignment with the energy level of the perovskite film and enhances the extraction and transmission of the interface charge. Among them, COFICZ&#8208;treated inverted PSCs achieved a maxmum PCE of 25.68% (certified 25.14%), the inverted PCE reached a minimum PCE of 22.92% for 1 cm2 device. The efficiency of inverted PSCs with a 1.68&#160;eV wide bandgap reached 22.92%, which is the highest datum of the reported 1.68 eV wide bandgap PSC. This lays the groundwork for the commercialization of perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. Additionally, the unencapsulated devices demonstrated a high degree of stability during operational use and when subjected to conditions of high humidity and temperature.

         <title>Pushing Theoretical Potassium Storage Limits of MXenes through Introducing New Carbon Active Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through defect local atomic environment manipulation, the potassium storage potential of the interior carbon layers in typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes has been unlocked. New sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites in Ti3C2Tx MXenes are highly exposed by an atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, leading to record&#8208;breaking potassium storage capacities (291 mAh g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling life (more than 20 months). These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating the neighboring environment of defects and provide insights into future high&#8208;performance electrode design strategies.








Abstract
Surface&#8208;driven capacitive storage enhances rate performance and cyclability, thereby improving the efficacy of high&#8208;power electrode materials and fast&#8208;charging batteries. Conventional defect engineering, widely&#8208;employed capacitive storage optimization strategy, primarily focuses on the influence of defects themselves on capacitive behaviors. However, the role of local environment surrounding defects, which significantly affects surface properties, remains largely unexplored for lack of suitable material platform and has long been neglected. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, typical Ti3C2Tx MXenes are chosen as model materials owing to metallic conductivity and tunable surface properties, satisfying the requirements for capacitive&#8208;type electrodes. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the potential of MXenes with modulated local atomic environment is anticipated and introducing new carbon sites found near pores can activate electrochemically inert surface, attaining record theoretical potassium storage capacities of MXenes (291 mAh g&#8722;1). This supposition is realized through atomic tailoring via chemical scissor within sublayers, exposing new sp3&#8208;hybridized carbon active sites. The resulting MXenes demonstrate unprecedented rate performance and cycling stability. Notably, MXenes with higher carbon exposure exhibit a record&#8208;breaking capacity over 200 mAh g&#8722;1 and sustain a capacity retention higher than 80% after 20 months. These findings underscore the effectiveness of regulating defects' neighboring environment and illuminate future high&#8208;performance electrode design.

         <title>Multimaterial Digital&#8208;Light Processing of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework (MOF) Composites: A Versatile Tool for the Rapid Microfabrication of MOF&#8208;Based Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel method, combining DLP with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system, for the arbitrary and multiplexed micropatterning of MOFs over large areas while maintaining pore accessibility. Demonstrations include a luminescent oxygen sensor, an encryption system, and a colorimetric sensor, enhancing the accessibility and potential of MOF&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Patterning Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs) is essential for their use in sensing, electronics, photonics, and encryption technologies. However, current lithography methods are limited in their ability to pattern more than two MOFs, hindering the potential for creating advanced multifunctional surfaces. Additionally, balancing design flexibility, simplicity, and cost often results in compromises. This study addresses these challenges by combining Digital&#8208;Light Processing (DLP) with a capillary&#8208;assisted stop&#8208;flow system to enable multimaterial MOF patterning. It demonstrates the desktop fabrication of multiplexed arbitrary micropatterns across cm&#8208;scale areas while preserving the MOF's pore accessibility. The ink, consisting of a MOF crystal suspension in a low volatile solvent, a mixture of high molecular weight oligomers, and a photoinitiator, is confined by capillarity in the DLP projection area and quickly exchanged using syringe pumps. The versatility of this method is demonstrated by the direct printing of a ZIF&#8208;8&#8208;based luminescent oxygen sensor, a 5&#8208;component dynamic information concealment method, and a PCN&#8208;224&#8208;based colorimetric sensor for amines, covering disparate pore and analyte sizes. The multi&#8208;MOF capabilities, simplicity, and accessibility of this strategy pave the way for the facile exploration of MOF materials across a wide range of applications, with the potential to significantly accelerate the design&#8208;to&#8208;application cycle of MOF&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Enhancing Spin&#8211;Orbit Coupling in an Indolocarbazole Multiresonance Emitter by a Sulfur&#8208;Containing Peripheral Substituent for a Fast Reverse Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;blue indolocarbazole multiresonance emitter is developed by a sulfur&#8208;containing peripheral substituent, achieving an emission maximum at 456&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum of merely 12&#160;nm, a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, and a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of nearly 30% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
A fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) remains an ongoing pursuit for multiresonance (MR) emitters but faces formidable challenges, particularly for indolocarbazole (ICz) derived ones. Here, heavy&#8208;atom effect is introduced first to construct ICz&#8208;MR emitter using a sulfur&#8208;containing substitute, simultaneously enhancing both spin&#8211;orbit and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling to afford a fast RISC with a rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;105&#160;s&#8722;1, nearly one order of magnitude higher than previous maximum values. The emitter also exhibits an extremely narrow deep&#8208;blue emission peaking at 456&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maxima of merely 12&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%. Benefiting from its efficient triplet upconversion capability, this emitter achieves not only a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.1% in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes but also greatly alleviates efficiency roll&#8208;off, affording record&#8208;high EQEs of 29.9% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and 18.7% at 5000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 among devices with ICz&#8208;MR emitters.

&lt;p&gt;A deep-blue indolocarbazole multiresonance emitter is developed by a sulfur-containing peripheral substituent, achieving an emission maximum at 456&#160;nm with a full width at half maximum of merely 12&#160;nm, a fast reverse intersystem crossing rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and a record-high external quantum efficiency of nearly 30% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in organic light-emitting diodes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fast reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) remains an ongoing pursuit for multiresonance (MR) emitters but faces formidable challenges, particularly for indolocarbazole (ICz) derived ones. Here, heavy-atom effect is introduced first to construct ICz-MR emitter using a sulfur-containing substitute, simultaneously enhancing both spin&#8211;orbit and spin&#8211;vibronic coupling to afford a fast RISC with a rate of 1.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, nearly one order of magnitude higher than previous maximum values. The emitter also exhibits an extremely narrow deep-blue emission peaking at 456&#160;nm with full-width at half-maxima of merely 12&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 92%. Benefiting from its efficient triplet upconversion capability, this emitter achieves not only a high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 31.1% in organic light-emitting diodes but also greatly alleviates efficiency roll-off, affording record-high EQEs of 29.9% at 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and 18.7% at 5000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; among devices with ICz-MR emitters.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Monolithic Integration of Full&#8208;Color Microdisplay Screen with Sub&#8208;5&#160;&#181;m Quantum&#8208;Dot Pixels</title>

         <dc:description>
The monolithic photolithograph integration of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m perovskite quantum&#8208;dot (PeQD) pixels is achieved on 0.39&#8208;inch blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED screens. This integration demonstrates full&#8208;color image and video display capabilities, with remarkable features including brightness exceeding 400&#160;000 nits, an ultra&#8208;high resolution of 3300 PPI, and a wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC.








Abstract
Monolithic integration of color&#8208;conversion materials onto blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting&#8208;diodes (micro&#8208;LEDs) has emerged as a promising strategy for achieving full&#8208;color microdisplay devices. However, this approach still encounters challenges such as the blue&#8208;backlight leakage and the poor fabrication yield rate due to unsatisfied quantum dot (QD) material and fabrication process. Here, the monolithic integration of 0.39&#8208;inch micro&#8208;display screens displaying colorful pictures and videos are demonstrated, which are enabled by creating interfacial chemical bonds for wafer&#8208;scale adhesion of sub&#8208;5 &#181;m QD&#8208;pixels on blue&#8208;backlight micro&#8208;LED wafer. The ligand molecule with chlorosulfonyl and silane groups is selected as the synthesis ligand and surface treatment material, facilitating the preparation of high&#8208;efficiency QD photoresist and the formation of robust chemical bonds for pixel integration. This is a leading record in micro&#8208;display devices achieving the highest brightness larger than 400 thousand nits, the ultrahigh resolution of 3300 PPI, the wide color gamut of 130.4% NTSC, and the ultimate performance of service life exceeding 1000&#160;h. These results extend the mature integrated circuit technique into the manufacture of micro&#8208;display device, which also lead the road of industrialization process of full&#8208;color micro&#8208;LEDs.

         <title>Stable Cycling of Na Metal Batteries at Ultrahigh Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study revisits the carbon interlayer strategy, establishing its threshold for Na deposition. Achieving an ultrahigh Na deposition capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8315;2 with 90% depth of discharge (DOD), this strategy addresses dendrite formation issues. This approach surpasses traditional hosting/seeding methods, which struggle with capacities &gt;10 mAh cm&#8315;2, offering valuable insights into interfacial ion transfer under extreme conditions.








Abstract
The development of sodium metal batteries has long been impeded by dendrite formation issues. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies, exemplified by sodiophilic hosting/seeding layers, have demonstrated great success in suppressing dendrite formation. However, addressing high&#8208;capacity applications (&gt;10 mAh cm&#8722;2) remains a significant challenge. Herein, the study revisits the interlayer strategy by simply covering a carbon nanotube (CNT) film onto the surface of a sodium metal anode, unlocking its overlooked potential for ultrahigh capacity applications. In situ Raman spectroscopy reveals the interlayer's fast&#8208;ion&#8208;storage feature, enabling deposition at the interface without capacity limitations. Consequently, in symmetric cells, one&#8208;year long&#8208;term reversible cycling and a record&#8208;high capacity of 50 mAh cm&#8722;2 under 90% depth of discharge is achieved, representing a significant breakthrough for stabilizing Na anode. Furthermore, the full cell with a 50&#8208;&#181;m thin metal anode and a high&#8208;loading Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode (12&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) delivers a stable capacity of 94 mAh g&#8722;1 for 270 cycles (94% capacity retention).

         <title>Multifunctional Copper&#8208;Phenolic Nanopills Achieve Comprehensive Polyamines Depletion to Provoke Enhanced Pyroptosis and Cuproptosis for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional Cu&#8208;Pic/HA nanopills have been designed to achieve total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting intracellular polyamines synthesis, enhancing polyamines consumption and reducing polyamines uptake. On the one hand, oxidative stress spawned by polyamines depletion can give rise to mitochondrial dysfunction and insufficient ATP supply, resulting in cuproptosis. On the other hand, polyamines depletion can activate the Caspase&#8208;1/GSDMD pathway and up&#8208;regulate S&#8208;palmitoylation of GSDMD to induce enhanced pyroptosis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis caused by polyamines depletion provided a new entry point for cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The overexpression of polyamines in tumor cells contributes to the establishment of immunosuppressive microenvironment and facilitates tumor growth. Here, it have ingeniously designed multifunctional copper&#8208;piceatannol/HA nanopills (Cu&#8208;Pic/HA NPs) that effectively cause total intracellular polyamines depletion by inhibiting polyamines synthesis, depleting intracellular polyamines, and impairing polyamines uptake, resulting in enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis, thus activating a powerful immune response to achieve anti&#8208;tumor therapy. Mitochondrial dysfunction resulting from overall intracellular polyamines depletion not only leads to the surge of copper ions in mitochondria, thereby causing the aggregation of toxic proteins to induce cuproptosis, but also triggers the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) within mitochondria, which further upregulates the expression of zDHHC5 and zDHHC9 to promote the palmitoylation of gasdermin D (GSDMD) and GSDMD&#8208;N, ultimately inducing enhanced pyroptosis. Then the occurrence of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis is conductive to remodel the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thus activating anti&#8208;tumor immune responses and ultimately effectively inhibiting tumor growth and metastasis. This therapeutic strategy of enhanced pyroptosis and cuproptosis through comprehensive polyamines depletion provides a novel template for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Carbon Dots with Intrinsic Photochromism and In Situ Radical Afterglow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective strategy is proposed to integrate afterglow and photochromism in carbon dots (CDs) by constructing the embedded naphthalene imide (NI) structure and encapsulating the CDs using polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP). Significantly, good appearance color tunability from colorless to brown, wide transition of luminous color from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow with lifetime up to 253 ms are observed.








Abstract
The combination of advanced photoluminescence characteristics to photochromism is highly attractive in preparing high&#8208;performance multifunctional photo&#8208;responsive materials for optoelectronic applications. However, this is rather challenging in material design owing to the limited mechanism understanding and construction principles. Here, an effective strategy to integrate photochromism and afterglow emission in carbon dots (CDs) is proposed through embedding naphthaleneimide (NI) structure in CDs followed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) encapsulation. The NI&#8208;structured CDs&#8208;PVP shows intrinsic photochromism owing to the in situ formation of NI&#8208;radical anions and controllable multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive afterglow behaviors related to the oxygen&#8208;trigged triplet exciton quenching and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the pristine CDs to the photoactivated CDs radicals. Notably, a wide range of appearance colors from colorless to brown, luminescence color transition from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow lifetime up to 253&#160;ms are observed. With the extraordinary stimuli&#8208;chromic and stimuli&#8208;luminescent CDs&#8208;PVP film dynamically responsive to multiple external stimuli, reversible secure snapchat, data encryption/decryption and synaptic imaging recognition are realized. These findings demonstrate a fundamental principle to design multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive photochromic CDs with afterglow, providing important understandings on the synergic mechanism of dynamic photochromism and emission behaviors and thereby expanding their applications in advanced information anti&#8208;counterfeiting and artificial intelligence.

However, this is rather challenging in material design owing to the limited mechanism understanding and construction principles. Here, an effective strategy to integrate photochromism and afterglow emission in carbon dots (CDs) is proposed through embedding naphthaleneimide (NI) structure in CDs followed by polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) encapsulation. The NI-structured CDs-PVP shows intrinsic photochromism owing to the in situ formation of NI-radical anions and controllable multi-stimuli-responsive afterglow behaviors related to the oxygen-trigged triplet exciton quenching and F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) from the pristine CDs to the photoactivated CDs radicals. Notably, a wide range of appearance colors from colorless to brown, luminescence color transition from blue to yellow, and much elongated afterglow lifetime up to 253&#160;ms are observed. With the extraordinary stimuli-chromic and stimuli-luminescent CDs-PVP film dynamically responsive to multiple external stimuli, reversible secure snapchat, data encryption/decryption and synaptic imaging recognition are realized. These findings demonstrate a fundamental principle to design multi-stimuli-responsive photochromic CDs with afterglow, providing important understandings on the synergic mechanism of dynamic photochromism and emission behaviors and thereby expanding their applications in advanced information anti-counterfeiting and artificial intelligence.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Click Chemistry Strategy Toward Spin&#8208;Polarized Transition&#8208;Metal Single Site Catalysts for Dynamic Probing of Sulfur Redox Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Fe single site catalysts with low spin state accelerate the conversion kinetics toward polysulfides. The evolution of Fe&#8208;N bond polarizability is dynamically observed by in situ Raman spectroscopy. In addition, the system is extended to other MPcs, providing guiding principles for the design of single&#8208;site catalysts for Li&#8208;S batteries.








Abstract
Catalytic conversion of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) is a crucial approach to enhance the redox kinetics and suppress the shuttle effect in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. However, the roles of a typical heterogenous catalyst cannot be easily identified due to its structural complexity. Compared with the distinct sites of single atom catalysts (SACs), each active site of single site catalysts (SSCs) is identical and uniform in their spatial energy, binding mode, and coordination sphere, etc. Benefiting from the well&#8208;defined structure, iron phthalocyanine (FePc) is covalently clicked onto CuO nanosheet to prepare low spin&#8208;state Fe SSCs as the model catalyst for Li&#8211;S electrochemistry. The periodic polarizability evolution of Fe&#8208;N bonding is probed during sulfur redox reaction by in situ Raman spectra. Theoretical analysis shows the decreased d&#8208;band center gap of Fe (&#916;d) and delocalization of dxz/dyz after the axial click confinement. Consequently, Li&#8211;S batteries with Fe SSCs exhibit a capacity decay rate of 0.029% per cycle at 2 C. The universality of this methodological approach is demonstrated by a series of M SSCs (M = Mn, Co, and Ni) with similar variation of electronic configuration. This work provides guidance for the design of efficient electrocatalysis in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Biodegradable Piezoelectric&#8208;Conductive Integrated Hydrogel Scaffold for Repair of Osteochondral Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin is reported. In vivo implantation experiments in Parma pig show that piezoelectric&#8208;conductive hydrogel scaffold achieves promising repair results, providing a versatile platform for tissue engineering.








Abstract
Osteochondral injury is a prevalent condition for which no specific treatment is currently available. This study presents a piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold composed of a piezoelectric cartilage&#8208;decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) and piezoelectric&#8208;conductive modified gelatin (Gel&#8208;PC). The piezoelectricity of the scaffold is achieved through the modification of diphenylalanine (FF) assembly on the pore surface, while the conductive properties of scaffold are achieved by the incorporating poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene). In vitro experiments demonstrate that bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) undergo biphasic division during differentiation. In vivo studies using a Parma pig model of osteochondral defects demonstrate that the piezoelectric&#8208;conductive scaffold exhibits superior reparative efficacy. Notably, the generation of electrical stimulation is linked to joint movement. During joint activity, mechanical forces compress the scaffold, leading to deformation and the subsequent generation of an electric potential difference. The positive charges accumulated on the upper layer of the scaffold attract BMSCs, promoting their migration to the upper layer and chondrogenic differentiation. Meanwhile, the negative charges in the lower layer induce the osteogenic differentiation of BMSCs. Overall, this piezoelectric&#8208;conducive scaffold provides a promising platform for the effective repair of osteochondral defects.

         <title>Mass Production of Multishell Hollow SiO2 Spheres With Adjustable Void Ratios and Pore Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating transmissions and reactions. However, practical applications are severely hindered due to the high costs and low production efficiency. Herein, a precursor hydrolysis method is developed, which enables the cost&#8208;effective production of SiO2 MHSs on a large scale and adjusting on its void ratios.








Abstract
SiO2 multishell hollow spheres (MHSs) as supports have multiple porous layers and internal voids, which present notable advantages in regulating mass transport and chemical reactions. However, practical applications of SiO2 MHSs are severely hindered because of their high costs and low production efficiency issues. Herein, it is overcome these obstacles by developing a precursor hydrolysis method and demonstrate a cost&#8208;effective production of void&#8208;ratio tunable SiO2 MHSs on a large scale, which has a much lower cavitation temperature (25&#160;&#176;C) and one order of magnitude decrease in cost. In addition, the new method can also be applied to fabricate TiO2 and SnO2 hollow spheres (HSs). In particular, an NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy is developed to tune the pore diameters and pore distributions of SiO2 MHSs with different void ratios. SiO2 MHSs with varying void ratios and pore distributions have the broadest controlling release time ranges (30&#8211;430&#160;h). The precursor hydrolysis method and NH4Cl precipitation&#8208;pyrolysis strategy offer adequate stimulus to push forward SiO2 MHSs from laboratory&#8208;scale to industry&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Multispectral Molecular Chiral Barcoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique chiral sensing platform is introduced that utilizes a pixelated array of achiral plasmonic nanostructures to perform Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) and Vibrational Circular Dichroism (SEVCD) in the mid&#8208;infrared range. This method enables the unique identification of enantiomers and biomolecules through a chiral &#8220;barcoding&#8221; scheme, offering a robust, low&#8208;cost solution for drug and biomolecule detection.








Abstract
More than half of pharmaceutical drugs in use are chiral, necessitating accurate techniques for their characterization. Enantiomers, molecules with mirrored symmetry, often exhibit similar physical traits but possess distinct chemical and biological implications. This study harnesses the strong light&#8208;matter interaction induced by &#8220;superchiral&#8221; light to perform Surface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Absorption (SEIRA) induced vibrational circular dichroism measurements in the mid&#8208;infrared spectral region. Utilizing a nanopatterned pixelated array of achiral plasmonic nanostructures, the system allows unique identification of enantiomers and biomolecules. Tunability of plasmon resonance facilitates spectral variation of the optical chirality over a wide infrared range, enabling development of a unique chiral &#8220;barcoding&#8221; scheme to distinguish chiral molecules based on their infrared fingerprint. This simple, yet robust sensor presents a low&#8208;cost solution for chiral mapping of drugs and biomolecules.

This work reports on the engineering of ultrasmall PANoptosis nano&#8208;inducers for ultrasound&#8208;amplified hepatocellular carcinoma therapy and lung metastasis inhibition through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species.








Abstract
Addressing the inefficiency of current therapeutic approaches for hepatocellular carcinoma is an urgent and pressing challenge. PANoptosis, a form of inflammatory programmed cell death, presents a dependable strategy for combating cancer by engaging multiple cell death pathways (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis). In this study, an ultrasmall Bi2Sn2O7 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;magnified multienzyme&#8208;mimicking properties is designed and engineered as a PANoptosis inducer through destroying the mitochondrial function of tumor cells and enhancing the intracellular accumulation of toxic reactive oxygen species, finally triggering the activation of PANoptosis process. The role of PANoptosis inducer has been verified by the expression of related proteins, including cleaved Caspase 3, NLRP3, N&#8208;GSDMD, cleaved Caspase 1, p&#8208;MLKL, and RIPK3. The inclusion of external ultrasonic irradiation significantly augments the enzyodynamic therapeutic efficiency. In vitro and in vivo antineoplastic efficacy, along with inhibition of lung metastasis, validate the benefits of the Bi2Sn2O7&#8208;mediated PANoptosis pathway. This study not only elucidates the intricate mechanisms underlying Bi2Sn2O7 as a PANoptosis inducer, but also offers a novel perspective for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Reverse Water Gas Shift Reaction with 1000&#8208;H Stability on High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Catalysts</title>

High&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;loaded TiO2 as an efficient and sintering&#8208;resistant catalyst for the light&#8208;driven RWGS with long&#8208;term stability of 1000&#160;h is developed. In situ characterizations confirm that the slow diffusion effect of high&#8208;entropy alloys endows the catalyst with excellent structural stability and the hydrogen surface coverage weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface, which solve two major problems of catalyst deactivation &#8722; sintering and poisoning to synergistically enable the unparalleled stability.








Abstract
Highly stable and active catalysts are of significant importance and a longstanding challenge for a number of industrial chemical transformations. Here, motivated by the principle of the high entropy&#8208;stabilized structure, high&#8208;entropy alloy&#8208;loaded porous TiO2 as an efficient and sintering&#8208;resistant catalyst for the light&#8208;driven reverse water gas&#8210;shift reaction without external heating is synthesized. The optimized CoNiCuPdRu/TiO2 catalyst exhibits a long&#8208;term stability of 1000&#160;h (1.23&#160;mol&#160;gmetal
&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 CO production rate, &gt;99% high selectivity). In situ characterizations confirm that the slow diffusion effect of high&#8208;entropy alloys endows the catalyst with excellent structural stability. The CO adsorption measurements and theoretical calculations consolidate that the hydrogen surface coverage weakens CO adsorption on the catalyst surface. Two major problems of catalyst deactivation &#8722; sintering and poisoning, are handled in one case, which synergistically enable unparalleled stability. This work provides new guidance for the rational design of ultradurable harsh&#8208;condition operation catalysts for industrial catalysis.

         <title>Polymer&#8208;Ion Interaction Prompted Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolyte for Room&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article unveils an interaction between polymer and solvent in a gel electrolyte for lithium&#8208;ion battery, that the polymer's polar group can participate in Li+ solvation structure and thereby inhibit the notorious solvent co&#8208;intercalation in graphite anode and excessive side reactions in Si and Li anodes. The quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes are beneficial for large current density operation, long&#8208;term cycling, or safety enhancement.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;ion batteries using quasi&#8208;solid gel electrolytes (QSEs) have gained increasing interest due to their enhanced safety features. However, their commercial viability is hindered by low ionic conductivity and poor solid&#8211;solid contact interfaces. In this study, a QSE synthesized by in situ polymerizing methyl methacrylate (MMA) in 1,2&#8211;dimethoxyethane (DME)&#8208;based electrolyte is introduced, which exhibits remarkable performance in high&#8208;loading graphite||LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) pouch cells. Owing to the unique solvent&#8208;lacking solvation structure, the graphite exfoliation caused by the well&#8208;known solvent co&#8208;intercalation is prohibited, and this unprecedented phenomenon is found to be universal for other graphite&#8208;unfriendly solvents. The high ionic conductivity and great interfacial contact provided by DME enable the quasi&#8208;solid graphite||NCM811 pouch cell to demonstrate superior C&#8208;rate capability even at a high cathode mass loading (17.5&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8208;2), surpassing liquid carbonate electrolyte cells. Meanwhile, the optimized QSE based on carbonates exhibits excellent cycle life (92.4% capacity retention after 1700 cycles at 0.5C/0.5C) and reliable safety under harsh conditions. It also outperforms liquid electrolytes in other high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with larger volume change. These findings elucidate the polymer's pivotal role in QSEs, offering new insights for advancing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery commercialization.

Abstract
Multiscale particle size functional pesticide carriers can provide more efficient protection for plants, but this protection is difficult to achieve via single&#8208;scale formulation technology. This study presents a novel one&#8208;step method for the preparation of lignin&#8208;based micro/nanocapsules with controllable proportions within a unified system. This strategy enables the adjustment of the proportion of nanocapsules to between 18.81% and 85.21%. The microcapsules (MCs) vary in diameter from 2 to 3&#160;&#181;m, whereas the nanocapsules (NCs) span from 160 to 220&#160;nm, with an encapsulation efficiency exceeding 90%. An increased proportion of NCs in the system leads to faster release, heightened sensitivity to UV light, and enhanced penetration into the leaves. During Phytophthora capsici (P. capsici) infection, the NCs in the leaves interact with the defensive enzymes of the plant to quickly respond. Moreover, an optimal balance of MCs and NCs is key to effective fungicide use, not just a higher concentration of NCs. A 65:35 ratio of NCs to MCs ensures effective inhibition of P. capsici outside leaves and a rapid response to leaf invasion. This study enhances fungicide efficiency and advances the development of nanoresponsive fungicides to promote sustainable agricultural practices.

         <title>Responsive Protection of Magnesium Alloys From Multicorrosive Media by Constructing Nanofluidic Channels in Self&#8208;Repairing Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidic transport systems are applied for in the field of corrosion protection, which exhibit the fastest releasing speed of inhibitors. Accordingly, the coating with nanosized channels possesses the shortest repair time (&#8804;7&#160;h), among all well&#8208;known Mg alloy self&#8208;repairing coatings reported to date.








Abstract
Low&#8208;density magnesium (Mg) alloys are excellent engineering materials, and can significantly reduce energy consumption by replacing existing steel and aluminum materials. However, Mg species are susceptible to corrosion, especially in harsh environments (high&#8208;temperature or acidic), severely limiting the range of practical applications. Here, 2D covalent organic framework (COF) is synthesized with pore diameters ranging from 1.5 to 2.9&#160;nm to obtain ultrafast nanofluidic channels. Loaded with silver (Ag+) ions, 2&#8208;mercaptobenzimidazole (2&#8208;MB) inhibitors are immobilized in the COF channels through the silver bridges. Based on the strong metal&#8208;complexing capability, Ag+ ions precipitated with various corrosive media (Cl&#8722;, Br&#8722;, I&#8722;, SO32&#8722;, S2&#8722;, S2O32&#8722; SO42&#8722;, CO32&#8722;, PO43&#8722;); meanwhile, the 2&#8208;MB inhibitors are rapidly released through the nanofluidic channels, forming a passivation film as a corrosion barrier to protect the Mg substrate. After integration with commercial polyethersulfone (PES), the COF&#8208;based coating exhibits high repairing capability achieving 100% damage restoration within 7&#160;h, outperforming all existing coatings of Mg alloys. Notably, the coating shows almost complete protection of Mg alloys after being treated in respective 473&#160;K, acidic (pH &#8776;4.0), and alkaline (pH &#8776;10.0) environments.

         <title>d&#8208;Orbital Induced Electronic Structure Reconfiguration toward Manipulating Electron Transfer Pathways of Metallo&#8208;Porphyrin for Enhanced AlCl2+ Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) can be used to regulate the electronic energy levels and electron transfer pathways. Thus, the NiTPP presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 8.3% and 73.9% in comparison with the capacities of FeTPP and ZnTPP, respectively.








Abstract
The positive electrodes of non&#8208;aqueous aluminum ion batteries (AIBs) frequently encounter significant issues, for instance, low capacity in graphite (mechanism: anion de/intercalation and large electrode deformation induced) and poor stability in inorganic positive electrodes (mechanism: multi&#8208;electron redox reaction and dissolution of active materials induced). Here, metallo&#8208;porphyrin compounds (employed Fe2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, and Zn2+ as the ion centers) are introduced to effectively enhance both the cycling stability and reversible capacity due to the formation of stable conjugated metal&#8208;organic coordination and presence of axially coordinated active sites, respectively. With the regulation of electronic energy levels, the d&#8208;orbitals in the redox reactions and electron transfer pathways can be rearranged. The 5,10,15,20&#8208;tetraphenyl&#8208;21H,23H&#8208;porphine nickle(II) (NiTPP) presents the highest specific capacity (177.1 mAh g&#8722;1), with an increment of 32.1% and 77.1% in comparison with the capacities of H2TPP and graphite, respectively, which offers a new route for developing high&#8208;capacity positive electrodes for stable AIBs.

         <title>Extending The Calendar Life of Fiber Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries to 200 Days with Ultra&#8208;High Barrier Polymer Tubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending PCTFE with organically modified montmorillonite, resulting in an ultra&#8208;low water vapor transmission rate of 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1 due to the more complex and tortuous pathways for water permeation. The resulting 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs achieved an extended cycle life of 870 cycles and a calendar life of 200 days, with over 80% capacity retention.








Abstract
Scalable fiber lithium&#8208;ion batteries (FLIBs) have garnered significant attention due to huge potential applications in wearable technology. However, their widespread applications have been limited by inadequate cycle and calendar life, primarily due to the high permeability of the encapsulation layer to water vapor in ambient air. To address this challenge, an ultra&#8208;high barrier composite tube is developed by blending polytrifluorochloroethylene (PCTFE) with organically modified montmorillonite (OMMT) for the continuous packaging of FLIBs. Due to the high crystallinity (&#8776;40.21%) and small free volume (103.443 &#197;3), the PCTFE tube exhibited a low water vapor transmission rate (WVTR) of 0.123 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. Furthermore, through the melt extrusion, OMMT with its plate&#8208;like morphology are fully exfoliated and dispersed within the PCTFE matrix. This created more complex pathways for water, increasing the diffusion path length and thereby reducing WVTR to 0.006 mg&#160;day&#8722;1&#160;pkg&#8722;1. This innovation enabled an ultra&#8208;long calendar life of 200 days and cycle life of 870 cycles for FLIBs, with over 80% capacity retention in ambient air. Additionally, 2%OMMT&#8208;PCTFE&#8208;FLIBs exhibited excellent flexibility, retaining an impressive 85.31% capacity after 10&#160;000 bending cycles. This research presents a simple yet effective approach to enhance the lifetime and practicality of FLIBs through building a high&#8208;performance polymer&#8208;based encapsulation layer.

         <title>Spatial Structure of Electron Interactions in High&#8208;entropy Oxide Nanoparticles for Active Electrocatalysis of Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>

High&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles are dispersed on carbon support via a fast Joule heating approach, enabling the long&#8208;range electron interactions for bridging adsorption with CO2 to promote the reduction conversion.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy oxides (HEOs) exhibit distinctive catalytic properties owing to their diverse elemental compositions, garnering considerable attention across various applications. However, the preparation of HEO nanoparticles with different spatial structures remains challenging due to their inherent structural instability. Herein, ultrasmall high&#8208;entropy oxide nanoparticles (less than 5&#160;nm) with different spatial structures are synthesized on carbon supports via the rapid thermal shock treatment. The low&#8208;symmetry HEO, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4, demonstrates exceptional performance for electrocatalytic carbon dioxide reaction (eCO2RR), including a lower overpotential, high Faraday efficiency across a wide electrochemical range (&#8722;0.3 to &#8722;1.6&#160;V), and sustained stability for over100&#160;h. In the membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer, BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 achieves a current density of 350&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 while maintaining good stability for 24&#160;h. Both experimental observations and theoretical calculations reveal that the electron donor&#8211;acceptor interactions between bismuth and indium sites in BiSbInCdSn&#8208;O4 enable the electron delocalization to facilitate the efficient adsorption of CO2 and hydrogenation reactions. Thus, the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step is reduced to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability. This study elucidates that the spatial structure of metal sites in HEOs is able to regulate CO2 adsorption status for eCO2RR, paving the way for the rational design of efficient HEO catalysts.

         <title>Controllable Contact&#8208;Destructive Hydrogel Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG) is innovatively proposed here. Such hydrogel actuator predetermined by diverse graphic patterns with the aid of 3D printing exhibits locomotion routes. Notably, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are well&#8208;demonstrated for the self&#8208;destructive hydrogel.








Abstract
Constructing hydrogels with spatially heterogeneous structures are crucial for unlocking novel applications. To this end, selectively removing a specific portion of hydrogels by facile and intricate destructive strategies is worth exploring. Herein, a &#8220;contact&#8208;destructive&#8221; hydrogel actuator is presented, composed of a dynamic hydrogel network doped with hydrophilic polyethylene glycol (PEG). The destructive behavior of the hydrogel actuator is attributed to the surface tension&#8208;induced spreading effect and the enhanced water absorption due to the additive PEG. Parameters that act on these mechanisms are used to control the destruction of the hydrogel. During the destructive process, the hydrogel actuator exhibits locomotion routes predetermined by the graphic pattern with the aid of 3D printing. Additionally, such self&#8208;destructive behavior can be terminated by UV light irradiation when PEG is replaced with poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA). Significantly, diverse applications including controllable 3D structures collapse, self&#8208;erasing, and on&#8208;demand cell release, are realized with such self&#8208;destructive hydrogel. These results demonstrate that the present hydrogel has great values in soft robotics, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, controlled drug delivery, and other related fields.

         <title>A Nucleophilicity&#8208;Engineered DNA Ligation Blockade Nanoradiosensitizer Induces Irreversible DNA Damage to Overcome Cancer Radioresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides, is developed. The DLBN, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, facilitating nucleophilic attack on phosphoester bonds. Remarkably, DLBN targeted inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance.








Abstract
During fractionated radiotherapy, DNA damage repair intensifies in tumor cells, culminating in cancer radioresistance and subsequent radiotherapy failure. Despite the recent development of nanoradiosensitizers targeting specific DNA damage repair pathways, the persistence of repair mechanisms involving multiple pathways remains inevitable. To address this challenge, a nucleophilicity&#8208;engineered DNA ligation blockade nanoradiosensitizer (DLBN) comprising Au/CeO2 heteronanostructure modified with trans&#8208;acting activator of transcription peptides is reported, which targets and inhibits the DNA ligation inside cancer cell nuclei via heterointerface&#8208;mediated dephosphorylation of DNA, a crucial step in overcoming cancer radioresistance. First, the Schottky&#8208;type heteronanostructure of cancer cell nucleus&#8208;targeting DLBN effectively intensifies radiation&#8208;induced DNA damage via catalase&#8208;mimetic activity and radiation&#8208;triggered catalytic reactions. Notably, by leveraging Au/CeO2 heterointerface, DLBN spontaneously dissociates H2O to hydroxide, a nucleophile with higher nucleophilicity, thereby exhibiting remarkable dephosphorylation capability at DNA nicks through facilitated nucleophilic attack. This enables the blockade of DNA ligation, a pivotal step in all DNA damage repair pathways, effectively interrupting the repair process. Consequently, DLBN resensitizes radioresistant cells by overcoming therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance, leading to a substantial accumulation of unrepaired DNA damage. These findings offer insight into the dephosphorylation of DNA within nuclei, and underscore the potential of heteronanostructure&#8208;based nanoradiosensitizer to block DNA ligation against therapy&#8208;induced radioresistance.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Modal Sensing Ionogels with Tunable Mechanical Properties and Environmental Stability for Aquatic and Atmospheric Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ionogels with a 3D supramolecular network can be constructed by cation&#8211;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding. The supramolecular ionogel possesses tunable mechanical properties, high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, high elasticity, and environmental stability. In addition, the ionogel can be used in flexible sensing and underwater communication transmission, demonstrating great potential in intelligent robots and wearable devices.








Abstract
Ionogels have garnered significant interest due to their great potential in flexible iontronic devices. However, their limited mechanical tunability and environmental intolerance have posed significant challenges for their integration into next&#8208;generation flexible electronics in different scenarios. Herein, the synergistic effect of cation&#8208;oxygen coordination interaction and hydrogen bonding is leveraged to construct a 3D supramolecular network, resulting in ionogels with tunable modulus, stretchability, and strength, achieving an unprecedented elongation at break of 10&#160;800%. Moreover, the supramolecular network endows the ionogels with extremely high fracture energy, crack insensitivity, and high elasticity. Meanwhile, the high environmental stability and hydrophobic network of the ionogels further shield them from the unfavorable effects of temperature variations and water molecules, enabling them to operate within a broad temperature range and exhibit robust underwater adhesion. Then, the ionogel is assembled into a wearable sensor, demonstrating its great potential in flexible sensing (temperature, pressure, and strain) and underwater signal transmission. This work can inspire the applications of ionogels in multifunctional sensing and wearable fields.

         <title>Stable Seawater Electrolysis Over 10&#160;000&#160;H via Chemical Fixation of Sulfate on NiFeBa&#8208;LDH</title>

The effective NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst that enabled chemical fixation of free SO42&#8211; by atomically dispersed Ba2+ and preferential electrostatic adsorption of SO42&#8211; on the electrode surface, resulting in unprecedented stability (&gt;10&#160;000&#160;h) at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2.








Abstract
Although hydrogen production through seawater electrolysis combined with offshore renewable energy can significantly reduce the cost, the corrosive anions in seawater strictly limit the commercialization of direct seawater electrolysis technology. Here, it is discovered that electrolytic anode can be uniformly protected in a seawater environment by constructing NiFeBa&#8208;LDH catalyst assisted with additional SO42&#8722; in the electrolyte. In experiments, the NiFeBa&#8208;LDH achieves unprecedented stability over 10&#160;000&#160;h at 400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in both alkaline saline electrolyte and alkaline seawater. Characterizations and simulations reveal that the atomically dispersed Ba2+ enables the chemical fixation of free SO42&#8722; on the surface, which generates a dense SO42&#8722; layer to repel Cl&#8722; along with the preferentially adsorbed SO42&#8722; in the presence of an applied electric field. In terms of the simplicity and effectiveness of catalyst design, it is confident that it can be a beacon for the commercialization of seawater electrolysis technology.

         <title>Broadband Spin and Orbital Momentum Modulator Using Self&#8208;Assembled Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spherulite structure with vortex spontaneous polarity possesses circularly anisotropic refractive index and second&#8208;order nonlinearity, boosting a range of linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including spin&#8211;orbit coupling and second harmonic sum frequency generation. Through these processes, single spherulite generates minimum three optical beams with desired spin and orbital angular momenta at wavelengths ranging from near&#8208;infrared to visible range.








Abstract
The structural symmetry of solids plays an important role in defining their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The quest for versatile, cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;scale, and defect&#8208;free approaches and materials platforms for tailoring structural and optical properties on demand is underway since decades. A self&#8208;assembled spherulite material comprised of synthesized molecules with large dipole moments aligned azimuthally, forming a vortex polarity with spontaneously broken symmetry, is experimentally demonstrated. This unique self&#8208;assembled structure enables new linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including generating optical vortex beams with complex spin states and on&#8208;demand topological charges at the fundamental, doubled, and tripled frequencies. This work will likely enable numerous applications in areas such as high&#8208;dimensional quantum information processing with large capacity and high security, spatiotemporal optical vortices, and a novel optical manipulation and trapping platform.

Through these processes, single spherulite generates minimum three optical beams with desired spin and orbital angular momenta at wavelengths ranging from near-infrared to visible range.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural symmetry of solids plays an important role in defining their linear and nonlinear optical properties. The quest for versatile, cost-effective, large-scale, and defect-free approaches and materials platforms for tailoring structural and optical properties on demand is underway since decades. A self-assembled spherulite material comprised of synthesized molecules with large dipole moments aligned azimuthally, forming a vortex polarity with spontaneously broken symmetry, is experimentally demonstrated. This unique self-assembled structure enables new linear and nonlinear light&#8211;matter interactions, including generating optical vortex beams with complex spin states and on-demand topological charges at the fundamental, doubled, and tripled frequencies. This work will likely enable numerous applications in areas such as high-dimensional quantum information processing with large capacity and high security, spatiotemporal optical vortices, and a novel optical manipulation and trapping platform.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Reversing Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor&#8211;Associated Cardiotoxicity via Bioorthogonal Metabolic Engineering&#8211;Driven Extracellular Vesicle Redirecting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a novel strategy named bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8208;driven extracellular vesicles (EV) redirecting (Biomeder) is developed to relief ICI&#8208;induced myocardial toxicity. Biomeder possessed the capacity of in&#8208;situ editing tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEV) with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptide and transporting the engineered EV into heart. Redirecting TuEV enabled immunosuppressive metastasis of tumor microenvironment to the heart, which simultaneously improved the effectiveness and safety of ICIs.








Abstract
The cardiotoxicity induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) is associated with high mortality rates. T cells play an important role in ICI&#8208;induced cardiac injury. The inhibition of local T&#8208;cell activity is considered an effective strategy for alleviating ICI&#8208;related cardiotoxicity. Tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) contribute to immunosuppression via PD&#8208;L1 overexpression. In this study, a bioorthogonal metabolic engineering&#8211;driven EV redirecting (Biomeder) strategy for in situ engineered EVs with myocardial&#8208;targeting peptides is developed. Accumulated tumor&#8208;derived EV (TuEVs) reverses the immune environment in the heart by increasing PD&#8208;L1 levels in cardiomyocytes and/or by directly inhibiting T&#8208;cell activity. More importantly, it is found that the redirection of TuEVs further disrupts immunosuppression in tumors, which facilitates anti&#8208;tumor activity. Thus, redirecting TuEVs to the heart simultaneously enhances the antitumor efficacy and safety of ICI&#8208;based therapy. Furthermore, the Biomeder strategy is successfully expanded to prevent ICI&#8208;induced type 1 diabetes. This Biomeder technique is a universal method for the treatment of various ICI&#8208;related adverse events.

Biomeder possessed the capacity of in-situ editing tumor-derived EV (TuEV) with myocardial-targeting peptide and transporting the engineered EV into heart.

         <title>Near&#8208;Field&#8208;Regulated Ultrafast Laser Supra&#8208;Wavelength Structuring Directly on Ultrahard Metallic Glasses</title>

This study develops the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser lithography of self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores as mid/far&#8208;infrared&#8208;modulating surfaces directly on ultra&#8208;hard metallic glass. The high regularity self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores has an adjustable period (1&#8211;5 &#181;m) and geometric shape (diameter 500 nm&#8211;6 &#181;m). It exhibits excellent infrared anti&#8208;reflection characteristics, the reflectance at 2.5&#8211;6.5 &#181;m has decreased from the original &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%.








Abstract
The ultrafast&#8208;laser&#8208;matter interactions enable &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; laser surface structuring, especially for materials difficult to process, with &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; self&#8208;organizing features. The subwavelength scenarios of laser&#8208;induced structuring are improved in defects and long&#8208;range order by applying positive/negative feedbacks. It is still hardly reported for supra&#8208;wavelength laser structuring more associated with complicated thermo/hydro&#8208;dynamics. For the first time to the knowledge, the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser lithography of self&#8208;arrayed supra&#8208;wavelength micro/nano&#8208;pores directly on ultra&#8208;hard metallic glass is developed here. The plasmonic hot spots on pre&#8208;structures, as the positive feedback, clamped the lateral geometries (i.e., position, size). Simultaneously, it drilled and self&#8208;organized into micro/nano&#8208;pore arrays by photo&#8208;dynamic plasma ablation and Marangoni removal confined under specific femtosecond&#8208;laser irradiation, as the negative feedback. The mechanisms and finite element modeling of the multi&#8208;physical transduction (based on the two&#8208;temperature model), the far&#8208;field/near&#8208;field coupling, and the polarization dependence during laser&#8208;matter interactions are studied. Large&#8208;area micro/nano&#8208;pore arrays (centimeter scale or larger)&#160; are&#160;manufactured with tunable periods (1&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m) and geometries (e.g., diameters of 500 nm&#8211;6&#160;&#181;m using 343, 515, and 1030 lasers, respectively). Consequently, the mid/far&#8208;infrared reflectivity at 2.5&#8211;6.5&#160;&#181;m iss decreased from &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%. The universality of multi&#8208;physical coupling and near&#8208;field enhancements makes this approach widely applicable, or even irreplaceable, in various applications.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Wearable Pressure Sensors with Stress&#8208;Concentrated Tip&#8208;Array Design for Long&#8208;Term Bimodal Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonfully conformal interface between the skin and electronics leads to further dissipation of weak physiological signals. This work enhances the mechanical transfer efficiency from behavior and physiological signals by introducing the stress&#8208;concentrated interface and self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel, achieving long&#8208;term stable monitoring. With the convolutional neural network algorithm for feature fusion, high&#8208;accuracy monitoring of human fatigue levels is realized.








Abstract
The great challenges for existing wearable pressure sensors are the degradation of sensing performance and weak interfacial adhesion owing to the low mechanical transfer efficiency and interfacial differences at the skin&#8211;sensor interface. Here, an ultrasensitive wearable pressure sensor is reported by introducing a stress&#8208;concentrated tip&#8208;array design and self&#8208;adhesive interface for improving the detection limit. A bipyramidal microstructure with various Young's moduli is designed to improve mechanical transfer efficiency from 72.6% to 98.4%. By increasing the difference in modulus, it also mechanically amplifies the sensitivity to 8.5&#160;V kPa&#8722;1 with a detection limit of 0.14&#160;Pa. The self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel is developed to strengthen the sensor&#8211;skin interface, which allows stable signals for long&#8208;term and real&#8208;time monitoring. It enables generating high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios and multifeatures when wirelessly monitoring weak pulse signals and eye muscle movements. Finally, combined with a deep learning bimodal fused network, the accuracy of fatigued driving identification is significantly increased to 95.6%.

         <title>Visible&#8208;Near Infrared Independent Modulation of Hexagonal WO3 Induced by Ionic Insertion Sequence and Cavity Characteristics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The three modes of &#8220;bright&#8221;, &#8220;cool&#8221;, and &#8220;dark&#8221; can be achieved by hexagonal WO3 through progressive ion intercalation and unique cavity optical characteristics. Additionally, it can also realize a broadband shielding effect from 550 to 2000 nm and a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, suggesting excellent practical applications value and energy efficiency.








Abstract
Dual&#8208;band electrochromic materials have attracted significant attention due to their ability to independently control sunlight and solar heat. However, these materials generally exhibit notable limitations, and the mechanisms for their dual&#8208;band independent regulation remain poorly understood. Here, the visible&#8208;NIR&#8208;independent regulation capabilities of hexagonal WO3 (h&#8208;WO3) are introduced for the first time. A structure&#8208;activity relationship that perfectly&#160;links the microscopic ion insertion sequence and cavity characteristics to the macroscopic dual&#8208;band electrochromic properties is established. The progressive ion intercalation process and the distinctive optical activity of the cavities are keys for enabling h&#8208;WO3 to independently modulate &#8220;bright,&#8221; &#8220;cool,&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Notably, h&#8208;WO3 demonstrates superior dual&#8208;band electrochromic performance with a broadband full shielding effect from 550 to 2000&#160;nm, achieving the widest full shielding band in dual&#8208;band electrochromic studies. Additionally, h&#8208;WO3 shows a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&#8722;2 at 0.25 A m&#8722;2, and requires only 49.1 and 209.7 mAh m&#8722;2 to complete a full round&#8208;trip switch between &#8220;bright&#8208;cool&#8221; and &#8220;bright&#8208;dark&#8221; modes, respectively. The constructed device offers a dynamic temperature control range of up to 10.5&#160;&#176;C and supports a maximum voltage of 2.86&#160;V, underscoring its considerable potential for practical applications and energy efficiency.

Additionally, it can also realize a broadband shielding effect from 550 to 2000 nm and a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.25 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, suggesting excellent practical applications value and energy efficiency.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dual-band electrochromic materials have attracted significant attention due to their ability to independently control sunlight and solar heat. However, these materials generally exhibit notable limitations, and the mechanisms for their dual-band independent regulation remain poorly understood. Here, the visible-NIR-independent regulation capabilities of hexagonal WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (h-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) are introduced for the first time. A structure-activity relationship that perfectly&#160;links the microscopic ion insertion sequence and cavity characteristics to the macroscopic dual-band electrochromic properties is established. The progressive ion intercalation process and the distinctive optical activity of the cavities are keys for enabling h-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to independently modulate &#8220;bright,&#8221; &#8220;cool,&#8221; and &#8220;dark&#8221; modes. Notably, h-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; demonstrates superior dual-band electrochromic performance with a broadband full shielding effect from 550 to 2000&#160;nm, achieving the widest full shielding band in dual-band electrochromic studies. Additionally, h-WO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; shows a high discharge capacity of 270.9 mAh m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.25 A m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and requires only 49.1 and 209.7 mAh m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to complete a full round-trip switch between &#8220;bright-cool&#8221; and &#8220;bright-dark&#8221; modes, respectively. The constructed device offers a dynamic temperature control range of up to 10.5&#160;&#176;C and supports a maximum voltage of 2.86&#160;V, underscoring its considerable potential for practical applications and energy efficiency.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bimetal&#8208;Biligand Frameworks for Spatiotemporal Nitric Oxide&#8208;Enhanced Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Two drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are employed to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy can trigger immunogenic cell death to augment immunotherapy, benefiting from its superior spatiotemporal selectivity and non&#8208;invasiveness. However, the practical applications of sonosensitizers are hindered by their low efficacy in killing cancer cells and activating immune responses. Here, two US Food and Drug Administration&#8208;approved drug ligands (ferricyanide and nitroprusside) and two types of metals (copper/iron) are selected to construct a bimetal&#8208;biligand framework (Cu[PBA&#8208;NO]). Through elaborate regulation of multiple metal/ligand coordination, the systemically administered Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] nanoagent shows sono&#8208;catalytic and NO release ability under ultrasound irradiation, which can be used for effective sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Moreover, Cu[PBA&#8208;NO] can downregulate intracellular glutathione levels that would destroy intracellular redox homeostasis and facilitate reactive oxygen species accumulation. The released tumor&#8208;associated antigens subsequently facilitate dendritic cell maturation within the tumor&#8208;draining lymph node, effectively initiating a T cell&#8208;mediated immune response and thereby bolstering the capacity to identify and combat cancer cells. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy.

         <title>Enhancing Compatibility of Two&#8208;Step Tandem Catalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia Over P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phosphorus&#8208;doping strategy is investigated to optimize the mismatched two&#8208;step tandem process of NO3RR. During the tandem catalysis, there is more favorable release of NO2&#8722; in the initial 2e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Cu, and superior efficiency in NO2&#8722; capture and conversion in the subsequent 6e&#8722; process over P&#8208;Co(OH)2, ultimately contributing to remarkable NH3 production.








Abstract
Electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) is a promising approach to realize ammonia generation and wastewater treatment. However, the transformation from NO3&#8722; to NH3 involves multiple proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer processes and by&#8208;products (NO2&#8722;, H2, etc.), making high ammonia selectivity a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;phase nanoflower P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 electrocatalyst consisting of P&#8208;Cu clusters and P&#8208;Co(OH)2 nanosheets is designed to match the two&#8208;step tandem process (NO3&#8722; to NO2&#8722; and NO2&#8722; to NH3) more compatible, avoiding excessive NO2&#8722; accumulation and optimizing the whole tandem reaction. Focusing on the initial 2e&#8722; process, the inhibited *NO2 desorption on Cu sites in P&#8208;Cu gives rise to the more appropriate NO2&#8722; released in electrolyte. Subsequently, P&#8208;Co(OH)2 exhibits a superior capacity for trapping and transforming the desorbed NO2&#8722; during the latter 6e&#8722; process due to the thermodynamic advantage and contributions of active hydrogen. In 1&#160;m KOH + 0.1&#160;m NO3&#8722;, P&#8208;Cu/Co(OH)2 leads to superior NH3 yield rate of 42.63&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2 and NH3 Faradaic efficiency of 97.04% at &#8722;0.4&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. Such a well&#8208;matched two&#8208;step process achieves remarkable NH3 synthesis performance from the perspective of optimizing the tandem catalytic reaction, offering a novel guideline for the design of NO3RR electrocatalysts.

         <title>Hybrid Passive Cooling for Power Equipment Enabled by Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid passive cooling composite is designed to enhance heat dissipation for equipment by achieving &#8776;0.98 solar reflectance and providing high evaporation cooling power. The composite lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.








Abstract
While providing electrical energy for human society, power equipment also consumes electricity and generate heat. Cooling equipment consumes a significant amount of electricity, further increasing energy consumption and load on the power grid. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop low&#8208;energy and sustainable cooling technologies for power equipment. In this study, a hybrid passive cooling composite designed to enhance heat dissipation for heavy&#8208;load power equipment is introduced. Specifically, the composite material achieves outstanding radiative cooling performance with an average solar reflectance of up to 0.98, while its excellent atmospheric water harvesting performance ensures high evaporation cooling power without the need for manual water replenishment. As a result, the composite effectively lowers the temperature of outdoor heavy&#8208;load power equipment (e.g., transformers) by 25.3&#160;&#176;C. The excellent heat dissipation properties of the composite make it a powerful tool in safeguarding electrical systems.

In this study, bioorthogonal chemistry to function in the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm are combined to develop an engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells (Cargocyte). Cargocytes can modulate the two most important immune cells, neutrophils, and macrophages, by reducing NETosis and decreasing M1 macrophages phenotype polarization to regulate immune microenvironment and promote wound healing.








Abstract
Persistent excessive inflammation caused by neutrophil and macrophage dysfunction in the wound bed leads to refractory response during wound healing. However, previous studies using cytokines or drugs often suffer from short half&#8208;lives and limited targeting, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effects. Herein, the enucleated mesenchymal stem cell is engineered by aptamer bioorthogonal chemistry to modify the cell membrane and mRNA loading in the cell cytoplasm as a novel delivery vector (Cargocyte) with accurate targeting and sustained cytokine secretion. Cargocytes can successfully reduce NETosis by targeting the nuclear chromatin protein DEK protein with aptamers and sustaining interleukin (IL)&#8208;4 expression to overcome the challenges associated with the high cost and short half&#8208;life of IL&#8208;4 protein and significantly prevent the transition of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in murine and porcine wound models and have powerful potential to improve wound immune microenvironments effectively. Overall, the use of engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells as a delivery system may be a promising approach for wound healing.

Cargocytes can successfully reduce NETosis by targeting the nuclear chromatin protein DEK protein with aptamers and sustaining interleukin (IL)-4 expression to overcome the challenges associated with the high cost and short half-life of IL-4 protein and significantly prevent the transition of macrophages into the M1 phenotype. Therapeutic effects have been demonstrated in murine and porcine wound models and have powerful potential to improve wound immune microenvironments effectively. Overall, the use of engineered enucleated mesenchymal stem cells as a delivery system may be a promising approach for wound healing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Ultrasensitive Wearable Pressure Sensors
The non&#8208;fully conformal interface between skin and electronics leads to further dissipation of weak physiological signals. This work enhances the mechanical transfer efficiency by introducing stressed&#8208;concentrated interface and self&#8208;adhesive hydrogel. With the CNN algorithm for feature fusion, monitoring of human fatigue levels is realized. More details can be found in article number 2406235 by Yina Liu, Zhen Wen, and co&#8208;workers.

Engineering Mesoscale T Cell Receptors
In article number 2310407, Robert Tamp&#233; and co&#8208;workers introduce innovative nanotools to control T cell receptor (TCR) clustering, crucial for immune recognition. By comparing ligand&#8208;induced and ligand&#8208;free conditions, researchers discovered that architecture significantly impacts TCR assembly. This approach enhances our understanding of TCR activation, paving the way for advanced immunotherapies, including CAR T cell therapies. Image credit: M.F. S&#225;nchez &amp; R.

Near&#8208;Field&#8208;Regulated Supra&#8208;Wavelength Ultrafast&#8208;Laser Lithography
In article number 2405766, Yun&#8208;Lu Sun, Peilei Zhang, and colleagues develop the near&#8208;field&#8208;regulated ultrafast&#8208;laser supra&#8208;wavelength structuring of self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores directly on hard&#8208;to&#8208;process (ultra&#8208;hard or high&#8208;melting&#8208;temperature) metals. The self&#8208;arrayed micro/nano&#8208;pores have adjustable period (1&#8211;5 &#956;m) and geometry (e.g., 500 nm&#8208;6 &#956;m in diameter). They decrease the surface infrared reflectance at 2.5&#8211;6.5 &#956;m from &#8776;80% to &#8776;5%. The universality of multi&#8208;physical coupling and near&#8208;field enhancements makes this approach widely applicable, or even irreplaceable, in various applications.

Janus Swarm Metamaterials
Magnetoactive Janus particles (MAJPs) with engineered functional compartments provide tunable structure and properties that enable fast swarming response, remote actuation, and advanced functions in electronics&#8208;free configurations. MAJPs were implemented in swarm metamaterials with programmable dynamic display, non&#8208;volatile and semi&#8208;volatile memory, Boolean logic, and information encryption functions in soft, wearable devices. More details can be found in article number 2406149 by Zenghao Zhang, Je?ery E. Raymond, Joerg Lahann, and Abdon Pena&#8208;Francesch.

Manipulating Single Atom Catalyst Spin State
In article number 2408461, Hao Li, Yuan Chen, Li Wei, and co&#8208;workers utilize polymer&#8208;protected permanent nanomagnets to manipulate the spin state of a single atom catalyst. Without modifying atomic structure, significantly improved oxygen redox reaction performance is observed. This approach is applicable to other magnetic catalysts, offering a new strategy to investigate the spin&#8208;dependent catalytic performance.

High&#8208;Entropy Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks
In article number 2407435 by Dorina F. Sava Gallis, R. Eric Sikma, and co&#8208;workers, a design strategy is implemented for the synthesis of high&#8208;entropy metal&#8208;organic frameworks (HEMOFs) derived from polynuclear metal clusters containing as many as 15 unique metals. The complex metallic composition in HEMOFs creates a rich landscape of catalytic sites that enables the conversion of atmospheric CO2 into value&#8208;added chemical feedstocks.

         <title>Advancing Heterogeneous Organic Synthesis With Coordination Chemistry&#8208;Empowered Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Evolution of coordination chemistry makes all the difference for single&#8208;atom catalytic organic synthesis. The relationship between the coordination structure and coordination effect of SACs and their action mode in organic synthesis is clarified. Current challenges and outlook are also described for potentially leading to the emergence of new catalytic insights.








Abstract
For traditional metal complexes, intricate chemistry is required to acquire appropriate ligands for controlling the electron and steric hindrance of metal active centers. Comparatively, the preparation of single&#8208;atom catalysts is much easier with more straightforward and effective accesses for the arrangement and control of metal active centers. The presence of coordination atoms or neighboring functional atoms on the supports' surface ensures the stability of metal single&#8208;atoms and their interactions with individual metal atoms substantially regulate the performance of metal active centers. Therefore, the collaborative interaction between metal and the surrounding coordination environment enhances the initiation of reaction substrates and the formation and transformation of crucial intermediate compounds, which imparts single&#8208;atom catalysts with significant catalytic efficacy, rendering them a valuable framework for investigating the correlation between structure and activity, as well as the reaction mechanism of catalysts in organic reactions. Herein, comprehensive overviews of the coordination interaction for both homogeneous metal complexes and single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic reactions are provided. Additionally, reflective conjectures about the advancement of single&#8208;atom catalysts in organic synthesis are also proposed to present as a reference for later development.

         <title>Advanced Materials for Energy Harvesting and Soft Robotics: Emerging Frontiers to Enhance Piezoelectric Performance and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review is focused on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezoelectric response of advanced materials, and to address scale&#8208;up and device integration challenges for complex systems and soft robotics. The working mechanisms and operation modes are highlighted for each material class, along with the application potential of piezoelectric perovskites, polymers, and biomaterials within device architectures.








Abstract
Piezoelectric energy harvesting captures mechanical energy from a number of sources, such as vibrations, the movement of objects and bodies, impact events, and fluid flow to generate electric power. Such power can be employed to support wireless communication, electronic components, ocean monitoring, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices. A variety of self&#8208;powered piezoelectric sensors, transducers, and actuators have been produced for these applications, however approaches to enhance the piezoelectric properties of materials to increase device performance remain a challenging frontier of materials research. In this regard, the intrinsic polarization and properties of materials can be designed or deliberately engineered to enhance the piezo&#8208;generated power. This review provides insights into the mechanisms of piezoelectricity in advanced materials, including perovskites, active polymers, and natural biomaterials, with a focus on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezo&#8208;response and facilitate their integration into complex electronic systems. Applications in energy harvesting and soft robotics are overviewed by highlighting the primary performance figures of merits, the actuation mechanisms, and relevant applications.

     alt="Advanced Materials for Energy Harvesting and Soft Robotics: Emerging Frontiers to Enhance Piezoelectric Performance and Functionality"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This review is focused on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezoelectric response of advanced materials, and to address scale-up and device integration challenges for complex systems and soft robotics. The working mechanisms and operation modes are highlighted for each material class, along with the application potential of piezoelectric perovskites, polymers, and biomaterials within device architectures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Piezoelectric energy harvesting captures mechanical energy from a number of sources, such as vibrations, the movement of objects and bodies, impact events, and fluid flow to generate electric power. Such power can be employed to support wireless communication, electronic components, ocean monitoring, tissue engineering, and biomedical devices. A variety of self-powered piezoelectric sensors, transducers, and actuators have been produced for these applications, however approaches to enhance the piezoelectric properties of materials to increase device performance remain a challenging frontier of materials research. In this regard, the intrinsic polarization and properties of materials can be designed or deliberately engineered to enhance the piezo-generated power. This review provides insights into the mechanisms of piezoelectricity in advanced materials, including perovskites, active polymers, and natural biomaterials, with a focus on the chemical and physical strategies employed to enhance the piezo-response and facilitate their integration into complex electronic systems. Applications in energy harvesting and soft robotics are overviewed by highlighting the primary performance figures of merits, the actuation mechanisms, and relevant applications. Key breakthroughs and valuable strategies to further improve both materials and device performance are discussed, together with a critical assessment of the requirements of next-generation piezoelectric systems, and future scientific and technological solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward the Integration of Machine Learning and Molecular Modeling for Designing Drug Delivery Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The integration of physics&#8208;based models from traditional simulation methods with data&#8208;driven models from artificial intelligence and data analytics paves the way for the rational design of nanocarriers for drug delivery.








Abstract
The pioneering work on liposomes in the 1960s and subsequent research in controlled drug release systems significantly advances the development of nanocarriers (NCs) for drug delivery. This field is evolved to include a diverse array of nanocarriers such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, dendrimers, and more, each tailored to specific therapeutic applications. Despite significant achievements, the clinical translation of nanocarriers is limited, primarily due to the low efficiency of drug delivery and an incomplete understanding of nanocarrier interactions with biological systems. Addressing these challenges requires interdisciplinary collaboration and a deep understanding of the nano&#8208;bio interface. To enhance nanocarrier design, scientists employ both physics&#8208;based and data&#8208;driven models. Physics&#8208;based models provide detailed insights into chemical reactions and interactions at atomic and molecular scales, while data&#8208;driven models leverage machine learning to analyze large datasets and uncover hidden mechanisms. The integration of these models presents challenges such as harmonizing different modeling approaches and ensuring model validation and generalization across biological systems. However, this integration is crucial for developing effective and targeted nanocarrier systems. By integrating these approaches with enhanced data infrastructure, explainable AI, computational advances, and machine learning potentials, researchers can develop innovative nanomedicine solutions, ultimately improving therapeutic outcomes.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy possesses specific functions, including providing uniform liquid environment, forming favorable reaction intermediates, generating strong polarity forces, exfoliating or etching reactants, and modulating the microstructure and crystal plane feature, thus enriching the creation pathways of high&#8208;performance catalysts.








Abstract
A breakthrough in manufacturing procedures often enables people to obtain the desired functional materials. For the field of energy conversion, designing and constructing catalysts with high cost&#8208;effectiveness is urgently needed for commercial requirements. Herein, the molten salt&#8208;assisted synthesis (MSAS) strategy is emphasized, which combines the advantages of traditional solid and liquid phase synthesis of catalysts. It not only provides sufficient kinetic accessibility, but effectively controls the size, morphology, and crystal plane features of the product, thus possessing promising application prospects. Specifically, the selection and role of the molten salt system, as well as the mechanism of molten salt assistance are analyzed in depth. Then, the creation of the catalyst by the MSAS and the electrochemical energy conversion related application are introduced in detail. Finally, the key problems and countermeasures faced in breakthroughs are discussed and look forward to the future. Undoubtedly, this systematical review and insights here will promote the comprehensive understanding of the MSAS and further stimulate the generation of new and high efficiency catalysts.

         <dc:description>
As an emerging p&#8208;type van der Waals semiconductor, tellurium (Te) exhibits great potential in advancing future electronics and optoelectronics. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the fundamental properties and synthesis strategies of Te nanostructures, followed by a detailed discussion of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress in their application across various advanced devices, including electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and large&#8208;scale circuits.








Abstract
As a true 1D&#160;system, group&#8208;VIA tellurium (Te) is composed of van der Waals bonded molecular chains within a triangular crystal lattice. This unique crystal structure endows Te with many intriguing properties, including electronic, optoelectronic, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, chirality, and topological properties. In addition, the bandgap of Te exhibits thickness dependence, ranging from 0.31&#160;eV in bulk to 1.04&#160;eV in the monolayer limit. These diverse properties make Te suitable for a wide range of applications, addressing both established and emerging challenges. This review begins with an elaboration of the crystal structures and fundamental properties of Te, followed by a detailed discussion of its various synthesis methods, which primarily include solution phase, and chemical and physical vapor deposition technologies. These methods form the foundation for designing Te&#8208;centered devices. Then the device applications enabled by Te nanostructures are introduced, with an emphasis on electronics, optoelectronics, sensors, and large&#8208;scale circuits. Additionally, performance optimization strategies are discussed for Te&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors. Finally, insights into future research directions and the challenges that lie ahead in this field are shared.

         <title>Advances in Functional Organosulfur&#8208;Based Mediators for Regulating Performance of Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organosulfur compounds containing dynamic C&#8211;S/S&#8211;S covalent bonds, exhibit tunable structures, unique functional adaptability, and environmental friendliness, enabling the rational design of targeted functionalities. This review summarizes the latest fundamental advances in their roles as functional mediators in optimizing the performance of diverse LMB systems and discusses the challenges, potential applications, and future research directions for this exciting class of materials.









Abstract
Rechargeable lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are promising next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their high theoretical energy density. However, their practical applications are hindered by lithium dendrite growth and various intricate issues associated with the cathodes. These challenges can be mitigated by using organosulfur&#8208;based mediators (OSMs), which offer the advantages of abundance, tailorable structures, and unique functional adaptability. These features enable the rational design of targeted functionalities, enhance the interfacial stability of the lithium anode and cathode, and accelerate the redox kinetics of electrodes via alternative reaction pathways, thereby effectively improving the performance of LMBs. Unlike the extensively explored field of organosulfur cathode materials, OSMs have garnered little attention. This review systematically summarizes recent advancements in OSMs for various LMB systems, including lithium&#8211;sulfur, lithium&#8211;selenium, lithium&#8211;oxygen, lithium&#8208;intercalation cathode batteries, and other LMB systems. It briefly elucidates the operating principles of these LMB systems, the regulatory mechanisms of the corresponding OSMs, and the fundamentals of OSMs activity. Ultimately, strategic optimizations are proposed for designing novel OSMs, advanced mechanism investigation, expanded applications, and the development of safe battery systems, thereby providing directions to narrow the gap between rational modulation of organosulfur compounds and their practical implementation in batteries.

Abstract
Proteins have emerged as promising therapeutics in oncology due to their great specificity. Many treatment strategies are developed based on protein biologics, such as immunotherapy, starvation therapy, and pro&#8208;apoptosis therapy, while some protein biologics have entered the clinics. However, clinical translation is severely impeded by instability, short circulation time, poor transmembrane transportation, and immunogenicity. Micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles&#8208;based drug delivery platforms are designed to solve those problems and enhance protein therapeutic efficacy. This review first summarizes the different types of therapeutic proteins in clinical and research stages, highlighting their administration limitations. Next, various types of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are described to demonstrate how they can overcome those limitations. The potential of micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;particles are then explored to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of proteins by combinational therapies. Finally, the challenges and future directions of protein biologics carriers are discussed for optimized protein delivery.

         <title>Activatable Fluorescence and Bio/Chemiluminescence Probes for Aminopeptidases: From Design to Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aminopeptidases as a type of exopeptidase can hydrolyze peptide bonds at the N&#8208;terminus of polypeptide and protein, serving as various key roles in the physiological and pathological processes. In this review, diverse representative examples of recent works about activatable aminopeptidase probes are summarized including sensing, imaging, and therapy, ranging from design, and working mechanisms to biomedical applications.








Abstract
Aminopeptidases are exopeptidases that catalyze the cleavage of amino acid residues from the N&#8208;terminal fragment of protein or peptide substrates. Owing to their function, they play important roles in protein maturation, signal transduction, cell&#8208;cycle control, and various disease mechanisms, notably in cancer pathology. To gain better insights into their function, molecular imaging assisted by fluorescence and bio/chemiluminescence probes has become an indispensable method to their superiorities, including excellent sensitivity, selectivity, and real&#8208;time and noninvasive imaging. Numerous efforts are made to develop activatable probes that can effectively enhance efficiency and accuracy as well as minimize the side effects. This review is classified according to the type of aminopeptidases, summarizing some recent works on the design, work mechanism, and sensing, imaging, and theranostic performance of their activatable probe. Finally, the current challenges are outlined in developing activatable probes for aminopeptidases and provide possible solutions for future advancements.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance AgSbTe2 Thermoelectrics: Advances, Challenges, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article comprehensively reviews the principles and performance optimization strategies of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics from materials to devices and points out the current research challenges and future development directions of AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Environmental&#8208;friendless and high&#8208;performance thermoelectrics play a significant role in exploring sustainable clean energy. Among them, AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics, benefiting from the disorder in the cation sublattice and interface scattering from secondary phases of Ag2Te and Sb2Te3, exhibit low thermal conductivity and a maximum figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit ZT of 2.6 at 573 K via optimizing electrical properties and addressing phase transition issues. Therefore, AgSbTe2 shows considerable potential as a promising medium&#8208;temperature thermoelectric material. Additionally, with the increasing demands for device integration and portability in the information age, the research on flexible and wearable AgSbTe2 thermoelectrics aligns with contemporary development needs, leading to a growing number of research findings. This work provides a detailed and timely review of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics from materials to devices. Principles and performance optimization strategies are highlighted for the thermoelectric performance enhancement in AgSbTe2. The current challenges and future research directions of AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics are pointed out. This review will guide the development of high&#8208;performance AgSbTe2&#8208;based thermoelectrics for practical applications.

         <title>Engineered Protein Hydrogels as Biomimetic Cellular Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 45, November 7, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extracellular matrix (ECM) influences cellular behaviors like proliferation and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with customizable properties, can mimic the ECM functions. These hydrogels, formed through self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, affect cells via bioactive domains in their polymer backbone. This review explores the modular design, stabilization methods, and future directions of these hydrogels as biomimetic scaffolds for cell culture.








Abstract
The biochemical and biophysical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) play a pivotal role in regulating cellular behaviors such as proliferation, migration, and differentiation. Engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels, with highly tunable multifunctional properties, have the potential to replicate key features of the native ECM. Formed by self&#8208;assembly or crosslinking, engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels can induce a range of cell behaviors through bioactive and functional domains incorporated into the polymer backbone. Using recombinant techniques, the amino acid sequence of the protein backbone can be designed with precise control over the chain&#8208;length, folded structure, and cell&#8208;interaction sites. In this review, the modular design of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels from both a molecular&#8208; and network&#8208;level perspective are discussed, and summarize recent progress and case studies to highlight the diverse strategies used to construct biomimetic scaffolds. This review focuses on amino acid sequences that form structural blocks, bioactive blocks, and stimuli&#8208;responsive blocks designed into the protein backbone for highly precise and tunable control of scaffold properties. Both physical and chemical methods to stabilize dynamic protein networks with defined structure and bioactivity for cell culture applications are discussed. Finally, a discussion of future directions of engineered protein&#8208;based hydrogels as biomimetic cellular scaffolds is concluded.

         <title>Breaking Mass Transport Limit for Hydrogen Evolution&#8208;Inhibited and Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mass transport limit is circumvented by the pulsed charging protocols, achieving (002)&#8208;textured, dendrite&#8208;free, and hydrogen&#8208;evolution&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping at ultrahigh current density up to 160 mA cm&#8722;2. The Zn batteries accordingly achieve high current density (50&#8211;100 mA cm&#8722;2), high areal mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2), and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
It is commonly accepted that batteries perform better at low current densities below the mass&#8208;transport limit, which restricts their current rate and capacity. Here, it is demonstrated that the performance of Zn metal electrodes can be dramatically enhanced at current densities and cut&#8208;off capacities exceeding the mass&#8208;transport limit by using pulsed&#8208;current protocols. These protocols achieve cumulative plating/stripping capacities of 11.0 Ah cm&#8722;2 and 3.8 Ah cm&#8722;2 at record&#8208;high current densities of 80 and 160 mA cm&#8722;2, respectively. The study identifies and understands the promoted (002)&#8208;textured Zn growth and suppressed hydrogen evolution based on the thermodynamics and kinetics of competing reactions. Furthermore, the over&#8208;limiting pulsed&#8208;current protocol enables long&#8208;life Zn batteries with high mass loading (29 mgcathode cm&#8722;2) and high areal capacity (7.9 mAh cm&#8722;2), outperforming cells using constant&#8208;current protocols at equivalent energy and time costs. The work provides a comprehensive understanding of the current&#8208;capacity&#8208;performance relationship in Zn plating/stripping and offers an effective strategy for dendrite&#8208;free metal batteries that meet practical requirements for high capacity and high current rates.

         <title>All&#8208;In&#8208;One Epoxy/MXene Nanocomposites with Bead&#8208;Type Polymeric Imidazole Latent Curing Agent for Enhancing Storage Stability and Flame Retardancy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and surface&#8208;functionalized Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength, due to the homogeneous dispersibility, synergistic charring capability of MXene and bismaleimide (BMI), and the catalytic effect of the MXene flakes.








Abstract
Developing a single&#8208;component epoxy system is challenging but crucial for advanced thermoset applications. Unfortunately, conventional latent curing agents using chemical or physical passivation do not provide satisfactory storage stability and the necessary property requirements. Here, it is demonstrated that all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite system, comprising epoxy resin, polymeric imidazole latent curing agent beads (PILCAB), and Ti3C2Tx MXene, exhibits excellent storage stability, improved flame retardancy, and enhanced mechanical strength. PILCABs, prepared through a Diels&#8211;Alder (DA) crosslinking reaction between furan groups of poly(imidazolyl methacrylate)&#8208;random poly (furfuryl methacrylate) (PIm&#8208;r&#8208;PFu) copolymer and bismaleimide (BMI), exhibit excellent storage stability, as stable as under 60 &#176;C storage due to the imidazole reactivity being suppressed synergistically by both physical and chemical passivation mechanisms. Ti3C2Tx MXene flakes, surface&#8208;functionalized with alkylated 3,4&#8208;dihydroxyl&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine, exhibit excellent compatibility with the epoxy matrix. Consequently, the enhanced storage stability, flame retardancy, and mechanical strength of the all&#8208;in&#8208;one epoxy/MXene nanocomposite are attributed to the strong DA bond formation in latent curing agent, efficient charring capability of MXene and BMI, and the catalytic effect of the MXene. This study opens new avenues for designing and developing single&#8208;component epoxy systems that satisfy demanding requirements, including storage stability, mechanical strength, and flame retardancy, which are essential for practical applications.

         <title>Multiple Defect&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Resolution Near&#8208;Infrared Mechanoluminescent Materials for Non&#8208;Destructive Detection of Blood Glucose and Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chemical co&#8208;substitution method of [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] is used to achieve continuous defect distribution. Combined with Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the impact of different defect types on electronic structure is discussed in detail, and the potential application of broadband NIR ML in non&#8208;destructive detection technology is explored.








Abstract
Mechanoluminescence (ML) materials, known for their ability to convert mechanical energy into light, are increasingly recognized for their potential applications, such as in intelligent stress sensing, in vivo bioimaging, and stress non&#8208;destructive monitoring. However, the low signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) and narrow&#8208;band emission of single&#8208;defect&#8208;induced ML materials usually limit their biological&#8208;related practical applications. Here, these limitations will be addressed by modulating the microstructure evolution in Y3Ga3MgSiO12:Cr3+ through the [Si4++Mg2+] &#8594; [Ga3++Ga3+] chemical substitution strategy. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation reveals the defect types and dynamic charge migration processes. In addition, Y3Ga3MgSiO12: Cr3+ with continuously distributed &#8220;shallow&#8208;deep&#8221; defects (0.68&#8211;1.61&#160;eV) can avoid persistent luminescence (PersL) and bright&#8208;field environment interference. Herein, such high SNR near&#8208;infrared broadband ML emission may provide a reliable way for high&#8208;quality biological non&#8208;destructive sensing and detection. Finally, benefiting from the different absorption of ML signals in glucose/lipid, one may find a novel non&#8208;invasive blood glucose/lipid testing technology in patients.

         <title>Managing Edge States in Reduced&#8208;Dimensional Perovskites for Highly Efficient Deep&#8208;Blue LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An edge&#8208;state management strategy toward highly efficient pure&#8208;halide low n&#8208;value (&#8220;n&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets) reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites is developed. Realizing octahedral tilting reconstruction with sterically hindered, edge&#8208;anchored ligands can effectively suppress lattice vibrations, thereby inhibiting exciton&#8208;phonon coupling. Consequently, high&#8208;efficiency and color&#8208;stable deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes are presented, showing the potential of reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites for ultrahigh&#8208;definition displays.








Abstract
Pure&#8208;halide reduced&#8208;dimensional perovskites, featuring large exciton binding energy and tunable bandgap, show great potential for high&#8208;efficiency deep&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, their efficiency, particularly in the low n&#8208;value phase domain (&#8220;n&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets), lags behind analogous perovskite emitters. Herein, it is demonstrated that the vibration of edge&#8208;dangling octahedra in the low n&#8208;value phase activates notorious exciton&#8208;phonon (EP) coupling, thereby deteriorating efficiency. To address this issue, an approach is reported to manage edge&#8208;state lattices by introducing tris(4&#8208;fluorophenyl) phosphine (TFP) ligands. Attributed to the large steric hindrance of TFP ligands and their strong binding affinity for edge&#8208;dangling octahedra, the edged&#8208;octahedral tilting reconstruction can effectively suppress lattice vibration and inhibit EP coupling. This strategy yields deep&#8208;blue emitting film with a spectral linewidth of 21&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 85% at low excitation densities.

&lt;p&gt;An edge-state management strategy toward highly efficient pure-halide low &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value (&#8220;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets) reduced-dimensional perovskites is developed. Realizing octahedral tilting reconstruction with sterically hindered, edge-anchored ligands can effectively suppress lattice vibrations, thereby inhibiting exciton-phonon coupling. Consequently, high-efficiency and color-stable deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes are presented, showing the potential of reduced-dimensional perovskites for ultrahigh-definition displays.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Pure-halide reduced-dimensional perovskites, featuring large exciton binding energy and tunable bandgap, show great potential for high-efficiency deep-blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs). However, their efficiency, particularly in the low &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value phase domain (&#8220;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&#8221; represents the number of octahedral sheets), lags behind analogous perovskite emitters. Herein, it is demonstrated that the vibration of edge-dangling octahedra in the low &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value phase activates notorious exciton-phonon (EP) coupling, thereby deteriorating efficiency. To address this issue, an approach is reported to manage edge-state lattices by introducing tris(4-fluorophenyl) phosphine (TFP) ligands. Attributed to the large steric hindrance of TFP ligands and their strong binding affinity for edge-dangling octahedra, the edged-octahedral tilting reconstruction can effectively suppress lattice vibration and inhibit EP coupling. This strategy yields deep-blue emitting film with a spectral linewidth of 21&#160;nm and a photoluminescence quantum yield of 85% at low excitation densities. The resulting PeLEDs achieve deep-blue emission at 469&#160;nm, with a maximum luminance of 2,428&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 10.4%, marking them among the most efficient deep-blue PeLEDs reported. The strategy also showcases universality for higher &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-value reduced-dimensional perovskites. It is believed that the observation, along with the edge-state management strategy, lays the groundwork for further advancements in reduced-dimensional perovskite optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Standing 1D Chains Enable Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Selenium Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A substrate&#8208;heating strategy is adopted to facilitate the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate, enabling the growth of Se films with a vertical orientation. The resulting Se films exhibit a 4&#8208;times increase in carrier mobility compared to horizontally&#8208;oriented Se films. Solar cells fabricated using these Se films achieve a record efficiency of 8.1%.








Abstract
The recent surge in tandem solar cells and indoor photovoltaics has renewed interest in selenium (Se), the world's first photovoltaic material, due to its intrinsic wide bandgap of &#8776;1.9&#160;eV, high stability, and non&#8208;toxicity in small quantities when applied in photovoltaics. However, with a 1D chained crystal structure, Se tends to grow crystalline films with a lying orientation&#8212;chains parallel to substrates arising from the low surface energy; this results in poor carrier transport across chains held together by weak van der Waals forces. Here a substrate&#8208;heating strategy that facilitates the interfacial bonding between Se and substrate is introduced, enabling the growth of Se films with a standing orientation&#8212;chains perpendicular to substrates. This achieves efficient carrier transport along covalently bonded chains. The resulting Se films thereby exhibit a fourfold increase in carrier mobility compared to lying&#8208;oriented Se films. Consequently, Se solar cells are achieved with the highest power conversion efficiency of 8.1% under AM1.5G 1&#8208;sun illumination. The unencapsulated devices exhibit negligible efficiency loss after 1&#160;000 h of storage under ambient conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in 3R ZnIn2S4 with Broken Inversion Symmetry for High&#8208;Performance Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4 with broken inversion symmetry is systematically investigated for its intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs). Benefiting from the presence of intrinsic STEs, the photoconductive effects induced by STEs can enhance their applicability in photodetection with remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum performance.








Abstract
Exploring novel materials with intrinsic self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) is crucial for advancing optoelectronic technologies. In this study, 2D 3R&#8208;phase ZnIn2S4, featuring broken inversion symmetry, is introduced to investigate intrinsic STEs. This material exhibits a broadband photoluminescence (PL) emission with a full width at half maximum of 164&#160;nm and a large Stokes shift of &#8776;0.6&#160;eV, which arises from the distortion of [ZnS4]6&#8208; tetrahedral unit induced by the symmetry breaking and strong electron&#8208;phonon coupling. The photophysical properties of the STEs exhibit a high Huang&#8208;Rhys factor (15.0), rapid STEs formation time (166&#160;fs), and extended STEs lifetime (1039&#160;ps), as demonstrated by experimental evidence from temperature&#8208;dependent PL, Raman spectroscopy, and ultrafast absorption spectroscopy. Additionally, STE&#8208;induced photoconductive&#160;effect is elucidated, indicating that intrinsic STEs in 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 can provide a synergistic effect that enhances absorption capacity, localization, and lifetime by capturing the self&#8208;trapped hole state. Consequently, the 2D 3R&#8208;ZnIn2S4 photodetector exhibits remarkable broad&#8208;spectrum photosensitivity, including a photo&#8208;switching ratio of 11286, response times of less than 0.6&#160;ms, responsivity of 15.2&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, detectivity of 1.02&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#185;&#185; Jones, and external quantum efficiency of 5032% under 375&#160;nm light. These findings provide new ideas for exploring materials with intrinsic STEs to achieve novel high&#8208;performance photodetector applications.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Incorporation&#8208;Induced Phase Transition in Co Nanoparticles for Low&#8208;Concentration Nitric Oxide Electroreduction to Ammonia at Low Potential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO conversion can effectively alleviate the artificially destroyed N&#8208;cycle balance. RuCo alloy nanoparticles in the hexagonal close&#8208;packed phase are synthesized and demonstrated as an electrocatalyst for efficient NO electroreduction. It exhibits a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at a low potential. With this RuCo electrocatalyst, a Zn&#8208;NO battery is assembled to simultaneously achieve NO removal, NH3 synthesis, and power output.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) represents a potential solution for improving the disrupted nitrogen cycle balance. Unfortunately, designing efficient electrocatalysts for NO reduction reaction (NORR) remains a notable challenge, especially at low concentrations. Herein, a displacement&#8208;alloying strategy is reported to successfully induce the phase transition of Co nanoparticles supported on carbon nanosheets from face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) to hexagonal close&#8208;packed (hcp) structure through Ru incorporation. The obtained RuCo alloy with hcp phase structure (hcp&#8208;RuCo) exhibits apparent NORR activity with a record&#8208;high Faraday efficiency of 99.2% and an NH3 yield of 77.76&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode at a NO concentration of 1&#160;vol %, surpassing Co nanoparticles with fcc phase structure and most reported catalysts. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the excellent NORR activity of hcp&#8208;RuCo can be attributed to the optimized electronic structure of Co site and lowered energy barrier of the potential rate&#8208;determining step through phase transition. Furthermore, the assembled Zn&#8208;NO battery using hcp&#8208;RuCo as the cathode achieves a power density of 2.33&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and an NH3 yield of 45.94&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. This work provides a promising research perspective for low&#8208;concentration NO conversion.

         <title>Engineering Higher&#8208;Order Topological Confinement via Acoustic Non&#8208;Hermitian Textures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors develop a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator by incorporating electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss in a cavity&#8208;based sonic lattice. Controlled via electrically biased carbon nanotube films, they engineer unconventional interface and corner&#8208;confining topologies through precise manipulation of gain and loss textures. This work may open new avenues for studying non&#8208;Hermitian topological physics in classical wave systems and designing versatile functional devices.









Abstract
Higher&#8208;order topological insulators are a newly unveiled category of topological materials, distinguished by their exceptional characteristics absent in conventional topological insulators, e.g., 1D hinge states, or zero&#8208;dimensional corner states, for instance. Adding attenuating or amplifying components manifest even richer and more intricate non&#8208;Hermitian topological properties. While losses, for the most part, come for free, decorating topological systems with the gain counterpart poses significant challenges. Here, a non&#8208;Hermitian second&#8208;order topological insulator (SOTI) is constructed for a sonic demonstration, by bestowing a cavity&#8208;based lattice both with electro&#8208;thermoacoustic gain and loss. The inner cavity walls are decorated with electrically biased carbon nanotube films to be able to manipulate spatially and in strength, a non&#8208;Hermitian response at will. These measurements demonstrate that this flexibility allows us to design highly unconventional interface and corner confining topologies by decisively engineering gain and loss textures within the unit cell. It is foreseen that the advances may enable new avenues for energy harvesting and fundamental understanding in condensed matter and classical topological&#160;physics.

&lt;p&gt;The authors develop a non-Hermitian second-order topological insulator by incorporating electro-thermoacoustic gain and loss in a cavity-based sonic lattice. Controlled via electrically biased carbon nanotube films, they engineer unconventional interface and corner-confining topologies through precise manipulation of gain and loss textures. This work may open new avenues for studying non-Hermitian topological physics in classical wave systems and designing versatile functional devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Higher-order topological insulators are a newly unveiled category of topological materials, distinguished by their exceptional characteristics absent in conventional topological insulators, e.g., 1D hinge states, or zero-dimensional corner states, for instance. Adding attenuating or amplifying components manifest even richer and more intricate non-Hermitian topological properties. While losses, for the most part, come for free, decorating topological systems with the gain counterpart poses significant challenges. Here, a non-Hermitian second-order topological insulator (SOTI) is constructed for a sonic demonstration, by bestowing a cavity-based lattice both with electro-thermoacoustic gain and loss. The inner cavity walls are decorated with electrically biased carbon nanotube films to be able to manipulate spatially and in strength, a non-Hermitian response at will. These measurements demonstrate that this flexibility allows us to design highly unconventional interface and corner confining topologies by decisively engineering gain and loss textures within the unit cell. It is foreseen that the advances may enable new avenues for energy harvesting and fundamental understanding in condensed matter and classical topological&#160;physics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ether&#8208;Modified Nonflammable Phosphate Enabling Anion&#8208;Rich Electrolyte for High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ether&#8208;modified nonflammable phosphate, DMEP, is designed to enhance the miscibility of high&#8208;concentration phosphate&#8208;based electrolytes with diluent. The DMEP&#8208;based electrolyte features a cation&#8208;anion aggregate&#8208;dominated solvation structure, which promotes the formation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphases, enabling long&#8208;term cycling stability in 4.7&#160;V high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.8Co0.10Mn0.10O2 ||Li pouch cells with a low negative/positive capacity ratio of 1.33.








Abstract
Phosphate&#8208;based localized high&#8208;concentration electrolytes (LHCE) feature high flame retardant and satisfactory cathodic stability for lithium metal batteries. However, stable cycling of those electrolytes at ultra&#8208;high upper cut&#8208;off voltages for long&#8208;term stability remains challenging. Herein, an ether&#8208;modified phosphate, diethyl (2&#8208;methoxy ethoxy) methylphosphonate (DMEP), is designed for high&#8208;voltage applications. The ether modification enhances the stability of the Li+&#8208;DMEP&#8208;FSI&#8722; coordination structure, promoting the formation of cation&#8208;anion aggregates (AGG) dominated solvation structure, which favors the generation of LiF&#8208;rich cathode electrolyte interphase layers compared to triethyl phosphate (TEP)&#8208;based LHCE. Consequently, cathode degradation, including transition&#8208;metal dissolution and electrode cracking, is well&#8208;suppressed. The LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li full cells using DMEP&#8208;based LHCEs show more than 90.7% capacity retention at an ultrahigh upper cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.7 V after 100 cycles. Notably, DMEP&#8208;LHCE exhibits enhanced safety than that of TEP&#8208;LHCE, suggesting its versatility and potential for next&#8208;generation lithium metal batteries.

         <title>Additive&#8208;Driven Enhancement of Crystallization: Strategies and Prospects for Boosting Photoluminescence Quantum Yields in Halide Perovskite Films for Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Enhancing the external quantum efficiency of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes relies on increasing the photoluminescent quantum yield (PLQY) of perovskite emitters through optimized design and synthesis. This review provides a holistic view of how the interplay between the interaction of additives with perovskites, the perovskite crystallization dynamics, and the PLQY of perovskite films collectively enhance device efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) hold great potential for applications in displays and lighting. To enhance the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of PeLEDs, it is crucial to boost the photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the perovskite films. The use of additives has emerged as a powerful chemical strategy to control the crystallization process in solution&#8208;processed perovskite films. The different types of additives that can be used reflect the various types of chemical interactions with the perovskite materials, influencing their crystallization process in various possible ways. Understanding the relationship between these chemical interactions and their impact on the crystallization process is a key step for designing emitters with improved PLQY and devices with superior EQE. Following the logic chain of additive&#8211;perovskite interactions, impacts on crystallization, and subsequent enhancement of PLQY and EQE, this review discusses how additives play a pivotal role in influencing the crystallization process to enhance the PLQY of the perovskite films. Furthermore, this assessment addresses the open challenges and outlines future prospects for the development of PeLEDs.

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Solution Processed Bilayer Metal Halide White Light Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile approach for generating white electroluminescence is demonstrated by combining the blue emission from metal halide perovskite (2D CsPBr3 NPLs) with the orange/red emission from 0D organic metal halide hybrid (TPPcarzSbBr4). The resulting tunable WLEDs, featuring a solution&#8208;processed bilayer structure without energy transfer between the two emitting layers, exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency of 4.8% with a luminance of 1507 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites and perovskite&#8208;related organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of luminescent materials for light emitting diodes (LEDs), owing to their unique and remarkable properties, including near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies, highly tunable emission colors, and low temperature solution processing. While substantial progress has been made in developing monochromatic LEDs with electroluminescence across blue, green, red, and near&#8208;infrared regions, achieving highly efficient and stable white electroluminescence from a single LED remains a challenging and under&#8208;explored area. Here, a facile approach to generating white electroluminescence is reported by combining narrow sky&#8208;blue emission from metal halide perovskites and broadband orange/red emission from zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) OMHHs. For the proof of concept, utilizing TPPcarz+ passivated two&#8208;dimensional (2D) CsPbBr3 nanoplatelets (NPLs) as sky blue emitter and 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 as orange/red emitter (TPPcarz+ = triphenyl (9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium), white LEDs (WLEDs) with a solution processed bilayer structure have been fabricated to exhibit a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.8% and luminance of 1507 cd m&#8722;2 at the Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.32, 0.35). This work opens a new pathway for creating highly efficient and stable WLEDs using metal halide perovskites and related materials.

Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based triboelectric nanogenerators (B&#8208;TENGs) represent an innovative fusion of eco&#8208;friendly, sustainable energy&#8208;harvesting technology with renewable and environmentally benign biopolymer material. This integration not only introduces novel pathways for advancing green energy solutions but also offers a critical approach to addressing contemporary environmental challenges and fostering sustainable progress. Over the past few years, B&#8208;TENGs have seen rapid and remarkable growth in the realm of biopolymers, device architecture, and their applications (e.g., implantable power source, electronic medicine, human anatomical and physiological movements monitoring sensors, etc.). In this review article, the promising developments in harnessing triboelectric biopolymers are encapsulated, enumerate their representative applications, evaluate the pros and cons of these biopolymers, highlight key challenges for future research, and offer strategic recommendations for innovating and realizing advanced B&#8208;TENGs.

         <title>Sensitive Self&#8208;Driven Single&#8208;Component Organic Photodetector Based on Vapor&#8208;Deposited Small Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully thermally evaporated single&#8208;component organic photodetector is demonstrated with high photoresponsivity at zero bias, resulting in a specific detectivity of 1 &#183; 1013&#160;Jones based on noise measurements. Ultrafast charge generation within one&#160;picosecond is observed in the neat photoactive material, which is attributed to the strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge&#8208;transfer states in the small molecule.








Abstract
Typically, organic solar cells (OSCs) and photodetectors (OPDs) comprise an electron donating and accepting material to facilitate efficient charge carrier generation. This approach has proven successful in achieving high&#8208;performance devices but has several drawbacks for upscaling and stability. This study presents a fully vacuum&#8208;deposited single&#8208;component OPD, employing the neat oligothiophene derivative DCV2&#8208;5T in the photoactive layer. Free charge carriers are generated with an internal quantum efficiency of 20 % at zero bias. By optimizing the device structure, a very low dark current of 3.4 &#183; 10&#8722;11&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.1&#160;V is achieved, comparable to the dark current of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art bulk heterojunction OPDs. This optimization results in specific detectivities of 1&#183; 1013&#160;Jones (based on noise measurements), accompanied by a fast photoresponse (f&#8208;3dB = 200&#160;kHz) and a broad linear dynamic range (&gt;&#160;150&#160;dB). Ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy unveils that charge carriers are already formed at very short time scales (&lt;&#160;1&#160;ps). The surprisingly efficient bulk charge generation mechanism is attributed to a strong electronic coupling of the molecular exciton and charge transfer states. This work demonstrates the very high performance of single&#8208;component OPDs and proves that this novel device design is a successful strategy for highly efficient, morphological stable and easily manufacturable devices.

         <title>Cyclodextrin Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Functionalized Carbon Materials with Optimized Interface Electronics and Selective Supramolecular Channels for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a strategy based on &#947;&#8208;CDMOF for regulating the microenvironment by optimizing interfacial electronic structures and selective supramolecular channels. It elucidates the primary mechanisms of supramolecular microenvironment regulation, providing a comprehensive understanding of electrolyte&#8211;cathode interface interactions and offering a general design approach for constructing stable, fast&#8208;charging supramolecular microenvironments.








Abstract
During the reaction process in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, Lewis acidic lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) affect ion distribution and overall electrolyte stability, degrading battery performance and product distribution (e.g., Li2S). Here, a microenvironment regulation strategy with optimized interface electronics and selective supramolecular channels, is proposed to enhance LiPS reaction kinetics through Lewis basic &#947;&#8208;cyclodextrin metal&#8211;organic framework (&#947;&#8208;CDMOF). To validate this concept, &#947;&#8208;CDMOF is rapidly synthesized on 3D graphene foam (GF) via a microwave&#8208;assisted method, resulting in a &#947;&#8208;CDMOF/GF cathode for high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries. A range of analytical techniques combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations confirm that introducing a Lewis basic supramolecular microenvironment mitigates the LiPSs shuttle effect, enhances polysulfide capture, and improves sulfur redox conversion. Additionally, COMSOL simulations reveal that the &#947;&#8208;CDMOF framework and oxygen sites significantly reduce volumetric expansion stress during the LiPS solid&#8211;liquid phase transition. Impressively, the &#947;&#8208;CDMOF/GF cathode exhibits exceptional performance, including a high specific capacity (1253.01 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 0.1C), excellent rate performance (589.68 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 5C), and long cycle life (over 1200 cycles). This study introduces a new concept of supramolecular microenvironment regulation and interfacial interaction strategy, offering a unique approach for the development of multifunctional electrode materials.

         <title>RAFT Polymerization for Advanced Morphological Control: From Individual Polymer Chains to Bulk Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition&#8208;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization is a transformative technique in polymer science, offering unprecedented control over polymer morphology across a vast range of length scales. Recent advances leverage RAFT's precision and versatility to enable advanced materials design by dictating monomer sequences at the molecular level, manipulating self&#8208;assembly to make mesoscale structures, and controlling micro&#8208;phase separation for intricate 3D printed structures.








Abstract
Control of the morphology of polymer systems is achieved through reversible&#8208;deactivation radical polymerization techniques such as Reversible Addition&#8208;Fragmentation chain Transfer (RAFT). Advanced RAFT techniques offer much more than just &#8220;living&#8221; polymerization &#8212; the RAFT toolkit now enables morphological control of polymer systems across many decades of length&#8208;scale. Morphological control is explored at the molecular&#8208;level in the context of syntheses where individual monomer unit insertion provides sequence&#8208;defined polymers (single unit monomer insertion, SUMI). By being able to define polymer architectures, the synthesis of bespoke shapes and sizes of nanostructures becomes possible by leveraging self&#8208;assembly (polymerization induced self&#8208;assembly, PISA). Finally, it is seen that macroscopic materials can be produced with nanoscale detail, based on phase&#8208;separated nanostructures (polymerization induced microphase separation, PIMS) and microscale detail based on 3D&#8208;printing technologies. RAFT control of morphology is seen to cross from molecular level to additive manufacturing length&#8208;scales, with complete morphological control over all length&#8208;scales.

         <title>Nanoengineering&#8208;Enhanced Capillary Cooling Achieves Sustained Thermal Protection for Ultra&#8208;High Heat Flux and Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research explores novel advancements in capillary cooling schemes for ultra&#8208;high heat flux and temperature. Micromodel experiment helps provide visualized evidence for evaporation&#8208;driven mechanisms behind capillary flow phenomenon in porous media. Nanoengineering significantly improves thermal protection capacity of capillary cooling. Results show that nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling holds significant potential as a reliable and sustained thermal protection scheme in the future.








Abstract
Extreme thermal conditions with heat flux densities exceeding 1 MW m&#8722;2 or temperatures reaching up to 1000 &#176;C are prevalent in various situations. However, thermal protection ability depends on specialized materials or is currently limited with existing cooling schemes. Herein, an innovative cooling scheme that relies on evaporation&#8208;driven capillary flow, enhanced by nanoengineering&#8208;designed porous structures with common materials, is proposed. Experimentally&#8208;obtained capillary flow cooling curve identifies critical heat flux corresponding to evaporation&#8208;driven flow stage, where coolants cool the surface and subsequent vapor impedes heat transfer from thermal boundaries. Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4 (titanium alloy, Ti&#8208;6Al&#8208;4V), and Al2O3 with thermal protection ability 50&#8211;180% higher than that without nanoengineering&#8208;designed. The authors&#8217; scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8211;3.1 MW m&#8722;2 and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Further, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, this scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering&#8208;enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high&#8208;temperature and high&#8208;heat&#8208;flux environments and paves the way for development of lightweight, long&#8208;lasting, and large&#8208;scale solutions for thermal protection.

Nanoengineering provides opportunities for enhanced capillary flow, which proves to endow bronze, TC4 (titanium alloy, Ti-6Al-4V), and Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with thermal protection ability 50&#8211;180% higher than that without nanoengineering-designed. The authors&#8217; scheme achieves critical heat flux up to 2.0&#8211;3.1 MW m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and performs thermal dissipation capacity almost twice higher than inherent latent heat of coolant. Further, in a supersonic wind tunnel with total temperature reaching up to 1792 K, this scheme effectively protects surfaces by cooling them to surface temperatures below 500 K. Nanoengineering-enhanced capillary cooling gives access to the application of common materials for high-temperature and high-heat-flux environments and paves the way for development of lightweight, long-lasting, and large-scale solutions for thermal protection.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Inhibiting Mitochondrial Damage for Efficient Treatment of Cerebral Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury Through Sequential Targeting Nanomedicine of Neuronal Mitochondria in Affected Brain Tissue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript synthesized a nanomaterial (MHT) with strong antioxidant properties that can sequentially target the mitochondria of CIRI brain tissue neurons (a&#8211;c). After sublingual intravenous injection, MHT uses its high affinity for damaged vascular matrix proteins and mitochondrial membrane protein Tom20 to sequentially target neuronal mitochondria, effectively reducing neuronal death by efficiently clearing mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS) and eliminating the inflammatory storm(d).








Abstract
Oxidative stress, predominantly from neuronal mitochondrial damage and the resultant cytokine storm, is central to cerebral ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (CIRI). However, delivering drugs to neuronal mitochondria remains challenging due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB), which impedes drug entry into affected brain tissues. This study introduces an innovative tannic acid (TA) and melanin&#8208;modified heteropolyacid nanomedicine (MHT), which highly specifically eliminates the neuronal mitochondrial reactive oxygen radicals burst to efficiently reduce neuronal mitochondrial damage through a strategically designed sequential targeting strategy from affected brain tissue to neuronal mitochondria. TA endows MHT with sequential targeting ability by binding to matrix proteins exposed to the damaged BBB and mitochondrial outer membrane proteins of neurons, while melanin significantly enhances the antioxidant capacity of MHT. Consequently, MHT effectively inhibits neuronal apoptosis by protecting mitochondria and reversing the inflammatory immune environment through the deactivation of the cyclic GMP&#8208;AMP synthase&#8211;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway. MHT demonstrated a strong therapeutic effect on CIRI, with an ultralow dose (2 mg&#160;kg&#8722;1) proving effective in reversing the condition. This work not only introduces a new avenue to significantly reduce CIRI through sequential targeting therapy but also offers a new paradigm for treating other ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury diseases.

         <title>Evidence of Quasi&#8208;Na Metallic Clusters in Sodium Ion Batteries through In Situ X&#8208;Ray Diffraction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets&#8208;8 (HDCS&#8208;8) anode uniformly adsorbs Na+ in the high&#8208;voltage slope region, resulting in the formation of small particle hexagonal quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters. Subsequently, the HDCS&#8208;8 anode transforms the small particle hexagonal systems clusters into large particle orthorhombic systems of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in the low&#8208;voltage region.








Abstract
Carbonaceous materials have been considered the most promising anode in sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) due to their low cost, good electrical conductivity, and structural stability. The main challenge of carbonaceous anodes prior to their commercialization is low initial coulomb efficiencies, derived from a lack of an efficient technique to reveal a fundamental comprehension of sodium storage mechanisms. Here, the direct observation of quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters in carbonaceous anodes during cycling through in situ XRD is reported. By means of such a technique, a strong self&#8208;adsorption behavior forming quasi&#8208;Na metallic clusters is detected within a rationally designed highly defective ultrathin carbon nanosheets (HDCS) anode. Such a self&#8208;adsorption and crystalline system transformation mechanism in HDCS brings capacity retention about 100% after 1000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. This work provides a new principle for designing high&#8208;performance carbon anodes for SIBs.

         <title>Congruent Glass Composite Scintillator for Efficient High&#8208;Energy Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The congruent glass composite scintillator with good processing capability&#160;and high scintillation light yield is constructed, which solves the problem of poor preparation and processing properties of scintillation single crystal and ceramic. The constructed glass composite scintillator is further verified in applications such as X&#8208;ray imaging and real&#8208;time radiation detection of fibers. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.








Abstract
The scintillator is the most crucial component in the high&#8208;energy ray detection system. The available scintillators suffer from the insurmountable drawbacks including poor shaping ability for single crystal and ceramic and low efficiency for glass. Here, a glass composite scintillator is proposed from a congruent crystallization system which possesses both excellent processability and high scintillating yield. It can be fabricated into diverse shapes and sizes including the bulk and tiny fiber. Benefitting from the unique compositing combination with a high crystallization ratio, the glass composite exhibits a giant scintillating light yield of &#8776;26,000 photons per MeV. The practical application for X&#8208;ray imaging is demonstrated and a high spatial resolution of 12 l&#160;p&#160;mm&#8722;1 is achieved. Furthermore, the fiber derived detector is built and the remote and micro&#8208;area detection is realized. These findings not only represent a novel design concept for the development of glass composite but also suggest a great step for expanding the scope of scintillators.

         <title>Constructing an Active Sulfur&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Rich Surface for Selective *CH3&#8208;CH3 Coupling in CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 Conversion With 92% Selectivity</title>

         <dc:description>
Plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x significantly lowers the formation energy of sulfur vacancies in ZnIn2S4, resulting in a sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich surface within the ZnIn2S4/MoO3&#8208;x photocatalyst. This enhances CO2 adsorption and activation, reduces the energy barrier for HCOO* formation, and promotes efficient *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling. Consequently, the system achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with a selectivity of 92.0%.








Abstract
To achieve high selectivity in photocatalytic CO2 reduction to C2+ products, increasing the number of CO2 adsorption sites and lowering the energy barriers for key intermediates are critical. A ZnIn2S4 (ZIS)/MoO3&#8208;x (Z&#8208;M) photocatalyst is presented, in which plasmonic MoO3&#8208;x generates hot electrons, creating a multielectron environment in ZIS that facilitates efficient C&#9472;C coupling reactions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that MoO3&#8208;x reduces the formation energy of sulfur vacancies (SV) in ZIS, thereby enhancing CO2 adsorption and activation. The SV&#8208;rich surface lowers the energy barrier for forming HCOO* to &#8722;0.33 eV whereas the energy barrier for forming *COOH is 0.77 eV. Successive hydrogenation of HCOO* leads to *CH2, which converts to *CH3 with an energy barrier of &#8722;0.63 eV. The energy barrier for *CH3&#8208;CH3 coupling is 0.54 eV, which is lower than the 0.73 eV for *CH2&#8208;CH2 coupling to form *C2H4. Thus, Z&#8208;M preferentially produces C2H6 over C2H4. Under visible light, Z&#8208;M achieves a CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 conversion rate of 467.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 92.0% selectivity. This work highlights the dual role of plasmonic photocatalysts in enhancing CO2 adsorption and improving C2+ production in CO2 reduction.

         <title>Intratumoral Injectable Redox&#8208;Responsive Immune Niche Improves the Abscopal Effect in Radiotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intratumoral injectable nanofiber&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) is engineered with redox&#8208;responsive IL&#8208;2 nanogels (NGs), &#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 NGs, and poly(I:C). The TIN converts X&#8208;ray radiotherapy (XRT)&#8208;treated tumor into in situ cancer vaccine by expanding neoantigen&#8208;specific tumor&#8208;infiltrating lymphocytes at the treated primary tumor site, thereby eliciting robust systemic anticancer activity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (XRT) is often utilized to improve the immune checkpoint blockade response in cancer management. Such combination treatment can enhance the abscopal effect, facilitating a prolonged and durable systemic response. However, despite intense research efforts, only a minority of patients respond to this approach, and novel strategies to increase the abscopal effect are urgently needed. Here, the development of an intratumoral (i.t.) injectable nanofiber (NF)&#8208;based tumor immune niche (TIN) that converts XRT&#8208;treated tumors into an in situ cancer vaccine, eliciting robust systemic antitumor immunity, is reported. This NF&#8208;based immune niche incorporates redox&#8208;degradable anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 (&#945;&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4) nanogels (NGs) and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) NGs for controlled release in hypoxic irradiated tumors, reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into a pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment, and expanding the tumor&#8208;infiltrating CD8+ T cell population. Additionally, it is functionalized with polyinosinic&#8208;polycytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) to promote antigen&#8208;presenting cell maturation and prime neoantigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells. In vitro studies demonstrate TIN's ability to prime antigen&#8208;specific CD8+ T cells and increase antigen&#8208;specific cell&#8208;killing efficiency under in vitro immunosuppressive conditions. In vivo studies confirm TIN's ability to elicit robust systemic anticancer activity in mouse melanoma and colorectal cancer models without inducing severe immune&#8208;related adverse events.

         <title>Engineering Strain&#8208;Defects to Enhance Enzymatic Therapy and Induce Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain&#8208;defect engineering is used to design a hollow MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG nanozyme by modifying MnMoOx with poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine and loading sorafenib. The oxygen defects induce excellent catalase&#8208;like&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;like catalytic activities, ensuring the disruption of the internal redox balance in tumor cells. Sorafenib restrains the system xc&#8722; and synergistically interacts with GSH depletion to induce ferroptosis.








Abstract
The effect of mimetic enzyme catalysis is often limited by insufficient activity and a single therapy is not sufficient to meet the application requirements. In this study, a multifunctional nanozyme, MMSR&#8208;pS&#8208;PEG, is designed and fabricated by modifying poly (ethylene glycol) grafted phosphorylated serine (pS&#8208;PEG) on mesoporous hollow MnMoOx spheres, followed by loading sorafenib (SRF) into the pores. Strain engineering&#8208;induced oxygen defects endow the nanozyme with enhanced dual&#8208;enzymatic activity to mimic catalase and oxidase&#8208;like activities, which catalyze the conversion of endogenous H2O2 into oxygen and subsequently into superoxide ions in the acidic tumor microenvironment. Moreover, as an n&#8208;type semiconductor, MnMoOx generates reactive oxygen species by separating electrons and holes upon ultrasonic irradiation and simultaneously deplete glutathione by holes, thereby further augmenting its catalytic effect. As a ferroptosis inducer, SRF restrains the system xc&#8722; and indirectly inhibits glutathione synthesis, synergistically interacting with the nanozyme to stimulate ferroptosis by promoting lipid peroxidation and accumulation and the downregulation of glutathione peroxidase 4. These results provide valuable insights into the design of enzymatic therapy with high performance and highlight a promising approach for the synergism of ferroptosis and enzymatic tumor therapy.

         <title>Advances in Spectro&#8208;Microscopy Methods and their Applications in the Characterization of Perovskite Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this perspective, &#160;current advanced spectro&#8208;microscopy methods that have been applied to perovskite materials are highlighted. Continued development of multimodal measurement techniques may be the key to covering the remaining parameter space to achieve both high spatial resolution and a deep penetration depth for a complete materials characterization.








Abstract
Perovskite materials are promising contenders as the active layer in light&#8208;harvesting and light&#8208;emitting applications if their long&#8208;term stability can be sufficiently increased. Chemical and structural engineering are shown to enhance long&#8208;term stability, but the increased complexity of the material system also leads to inhomogeneous functional properties across various length scales. Thus, scanning probe and high&#8208;resolution microscopy characterization techniques are needed to reveal the role of local defects and the results promise to act as the foundation for future device improvements. A look at the parameter space: technique&#8208;specific sample penetration depth versus probe size highlights a gap in current methods. High spatial resolution combined with a deep penetration depth is not yet achievable. However, multimodal measurement technique may be the key to covering this parameter space. In this perspective, current advanced spectro&#8208;microscopy methods which have been applied to perovskite materials are highlighted.

         <title>Boosting the Structural and Electrochemical Stability of Chloride&#8208;Ion&#8208;Conducting Perovskite Solid Electrolytes by Alkali Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Alkali ion doping is proposed to endow the CsSnCl3 solid electrolyte with a robust cubic structure against broad temperature variations at 213&#8722;473 K or a high relative humidity of 90%. Mild annealing further modifies the microstructure, resulting in a two fold increase in chloride ion conductivity and impressive electrochemical stability in various solid&#8208;state chloride ion batteries.








Abstract
The use of chloride&#8208;based solid electrolytes derived from Lewis acid&#8210;base reactions enables the construction of various new rechargeable batteries, such as chloride ion batteries (CIBs). However, a critical problem with these electrolytes is their poor stability under low&#8208;temperature, moist, or electrochemical conditions, which can lead to deterioration of the phase structure and a loss of ion conduction. Herein, the robust cubic structure of tin&#8208;based perovskite chloride&#8212;a chloride ion conductor&#8212;is achieved by alkali ion doping at the tin site via direct mechanical milling. The as&#8208;prepared cubic CsSn0.925Na0.075Cl2.925 (CSNC) electrolyte exhibits outstanding structural stability over a broad temperature range of 213&#8722;473 K or under a high relative humidity of up to 90%, at which the typical chloride electrolytes previously reported deteriorate because of moisture. Importantly, mild annealing can modify the microstructure of the CSNC, resulting in a two fold increase in ionic conductivity and an increase in electrochemical stability, which is superior to those of other chloride electrolytes reported in previous studies. The effective chloride&#8208;ion transfer and wide electrochemical window of the CSNC are further demonstrated in different solid&#8208;state CIBs.

         <title>Substantially Enhanced Spin Polarization in Epitaxial CrTe2 Quantum Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A firm and clear picture of the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin texture indeed gives direct evidence of the intrinsic effective spin polarization of CrTe2. Atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, opens up an exciting opportunity to investigate exotic spin physics in 2D limit.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) magnets, which extend to the monolayer (ML) limit, are rapidly gaining prominence in logic applications for low&#8208;power electronics. To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe2 as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe2 thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin&#8208;splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic&#8208;layer&#8208;dependent spin&#8208;resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe2 film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe2 ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW&#8208;based spintronic devices.

To improve the performance of spintronic devices, such as vdW magnetic tunnel junctions, a large effective spin polarization of valence electrons is highly desired. Despite its considerable significance, direct probe of spin polarization in these 2D magnets has not been extensively explored. Here, using 2D vdW ferromagnet of CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as a prototype, the spin degrees of freedom in the thin films are directly probed using Mott polarimetry. The electronic band of 50 ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin film, spanning the Brillouin zone, exhibits pronounced spin-splitting with polarization peaking at 7.9% along the out-of-plane direction. Surprisingly, atomic-layer-dependent spin-resolved measurements show a significantly enhanced spin polarization in a 3 ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film, achieving 23.4% polarization even in the absence of an external magnetic field. The demonstrated correlation between spin polarization and film thickness highlights the pivotal influence of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, interlayer interactions, and itinerant behavior on these properties, as corroborated by theoretical analysis. This groundbreaking experimental verification of intrinsic effective spin polarization in CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ultrathin films marks a significant advance in establishing 2D ferromagnetic atomic layers as a promising platform for innovative vdW-based spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unlocking the Trade&#8208;off Between Intrinsic and Interfacial Thermal Transport of Boron Nitride Nanosheets by Surface Functionalization for Advanced Thermal Interface Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlocking the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of hexagonal boron nitride nanosheets (BNNS) within thermal interface material. The surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high thermal conductivity of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix.








Abstract
The increasing computing power of AI presents a major challenge for high&#8208;power chip solution and heat dissipation. Boron nitride nanosheet&#8208;based thermal interface materials (BNNS&#8208;based TIMs) exhibit excellent electrical insulation property, ensuring the secure and stable operation of chips. However, the efficiency of micro/nano interfacial thermal transport is limited, impeding further enhancements in the thermal conductivity (TC) of BNNS&#8208;based TIMs. Here, a strategy of surface functionalization is reported to unlock the trade&#8208;off between the intrinsic and interfacial thermal transport of BNNS within TIMs. These results suggest that the surface functionalization maintains the intrinsic high TC of BNNS while significantly increasing binding energy between micro/nano interfaces in BNNS&#8208;based TIMs, effectively reducing interfacial thermal resistance of BNNS joint interfaces and interfaces between BNNSs and the matrix by 50% and 26.1%, respectively. The BNNS&#8208;based TIMs exhibit excellent TC (&#8776;21&#8211;25&#160;W/(m&#183;K)) and ultralow Young's modulus, which can promote the development of flexible high&#8208;performance chip cooling technology in the AI industry.

         <title>Biomimetic Chlorosomes: Oxygen&#8208;Independent Photocatalytic Nanoreactors for Efficient Combination Photoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chlorosome&#8208;mimetic nanoreactors (Ru&#8208;Chlos) are created by the confined aggregation of photosensitive ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;silane monomers, which exhibit superior photocatalytic ability under acidic conditions without consuming oxygen. The photocatalytic activity of Ru&#8208;Chlos is impeded by the light&#8208;responsive disassembly of Ru&#8208;bridged matrix. Ru&#8208;Chlos&#8208;based combined therapy evokes strong immunogenic cell death effects and advances of efficient and safe light&#8208;controllable cancer photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
Photocatalytic therapy for hypoxic tumors often suffers from inefficiencies due to its dependence on oxygen and the risk of uncontrolled activation. Inspired by the oxygen&#8208;independent and precisely regulated photocatalytic functions of natural light&#8208;harvesting chlorosomes, chlorosome&#8208;mimetic nanoreactors, termed Ru&#8208;Chlos, are engineered by confining the aggregation of photosensitive ruthenium&#8208;polypyridyl&#8208;silane monomers. These Ru&#8208;Chlos exhibit markedly enhanced photocatalytic performance compared to their monomeric counterparts under acidic conditions, while notably bypassing the consumption of oxygen or hydrogen peroxide. The photocatalytic activity of Ru&#8208;Chlos is finely tunable through light&#8208;responsive disassembly of the Ru&#8208;bridged matrix, with tunability governed by pre&#8208;irradiation duration. Utilization of Ru&#8208;Chlos loading prodrug [2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis(3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulfonic acid)] (ABTS) for phototherapy facilitates the generation of toxic radicals (oxABTS) and the photocatalytic conversion of endogenous NADH to NAD+, inducing oxidative stress in hypoxic cancer cells. Simultaneously, the light&#8208;responsive degradation of Ru&#8208;Chlos produces Ru&#8208;based toxins that further contribute to the therapeutic effect. This dual&#8208;action mechanism elicits potent immunogenic cell death effects and significantly enhances antitumor efficacy with the aid of a PD&#8208;l blockade. These biomimetic chlorosomes highlight their potential to advance oxygen&#8208;independent photocatalytic nanoreactors with controlled activity for novel cancer photoimmunotherapy strategies.

         <title>Engineering the Functional Expansion of Microneedles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the interdisciplinary engineering advancements that have expanded the functionality and biomedical applications of microneedles, with a focus on electronic, electromagnetic and magnetic, photonic, and mechanical engineering.








Abstract
Microneedles (MNs), composed of an array of micro&#8208;sized needles and a supporting base, have transcended their initial use to replace hypodermic needles in drug delivery and fluid collection, advancing toward multifunctional platforms. In this review, four major areas are summarized in interdisciplinary engineering approaches combined with MNs technology. First, electronics engineering, the most extensively researched field, enables applications in biomonitoring, electrical stimulation, and closed&#8208;loop theranostics through the generation, transmission, and transformation of electrical signals. Second, in electromagnetic engineering, the responsiveness of electromagnetic induction offers prospects for remote and programmable therapeutic applications. Third, photonic engineering endows MNs with novel functionalities, such as waveguiding and photonic manipulation to enhance optical therapeutic capabilities and facilitate the visualization of disease progression and treatment processes. Lastly, it reviewed the role of mechanical engineering in conferring shape adaptability and programmable motion features necessary for various MNs applications. This review focuses on the functionalities that emerge from the intersection of MNs with complementary engineering technologies, aiming to inspire further research and innovation in microneedle technology for biomedical applications.

This study explores composition&#8208;structure&#8208;performance relationships in high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides for oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells.

The model yields an unambiguous statistical correlation between the distortion of the oxygen sublattice and the highest electrochemical performances and oxygen kinetics.








Abstract
Perovskite oxides form a large family of materials with applications across various fields, owing to their structural and chemical flexibility. Efficient exploration of this extensive compositional space is now achievable through automated high&#8208;throughput experimentation combined with machine learning. In this study, we investigate the composition&#8211;structure&#8211;performance relationships of high&#8208;entropy La0.8Sr0.2MnxCoyFezO3&#177;&#120749; perovskite oxides (0 &lt; x, y, z &lt;1; x+y+z&#8776;1) for application as oxygen electrodes in Solid Oxide Cells. Following the deposition of a continuous compositional map using thin&#8208;film combinatorial pulsed laser deposition, compositional, structural, and performance properties are characterized using six different techniques with mapping capabilities. Random forests effectively model electrochemical performance, consistently identifying Fe&#8208;rich oxides as optimal compounds with the lowest area&#8208;specific resistance values for oxygen electrodes at 700 &#176;C. Additionally, the models identify a statistical correlation between oxygen sublattice distortion&#8212;derived from spectral analysis of Raman&#8208;active modes&#8212;and enhanced performance.

This is the first strain engineering in molecular ionic multiferroics. Under a strain of 2.0%, a tenfold increase in piezoelectric performance and a significant reduction of 50% in the ferroelectric coercive field are observed, which unveils a novel strategy to augment the performance of molecular multiferroics.








Abstract
Multiferroics are appealing because of application potentials in data storage devices, sensors, transducers, and energy harvesters. Molecular multiferroics emerge as a promising alternative to inorganic multiferroics due to flexibility, light weight, low toxicity, solution processing, structural diversity, and chemical tunability. While researches have predominantly focused on perovskite structures, studies on molecular ionic multiferroics remain relatively limited. It is urgent to creatively build a novel platform for studying and developing the coupling and interaction between the stress, electricity, and magnetism. Knowing this, the work focuses on a novel organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid multiferroic N&#8208;ethyl&#8208;N&#8208;(fluoromethyl)&#8208;N&#8208;methylethylammonium tetrabromoferrate (III) showing coexisting magnetic and electric orderings. It undergoes antiferromagnetic, ferroelectric, and ferroelastic transitions. Notably, under a strain of 2.0%, the piezoelectric response increases tenfold, and the coercive field of ferroelectric polarization is reduced by half. The strain&#8208;induced enhancement of piezoelectricity is rarely reported in molecular multiferroics. Density functional theory is employed to predict that the mechanism of the large piezoelectric response under strain engineering is related to the cation rotation and phase switching between the stable phase and an energetically competitive metastable phase. This study creates a new paradigm to develop molecular multiferroics and future microelectronic devices for energy conversion.

         <title>Ultrafast Na&#8208;Ion Storage in Amorphization Engineered Hollow Vanadium Oxide/MXene Nanohybrids for High&#8208;Performance Sodium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped MXene&#8208;encapsulated vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) that enable reversible Na+ storage through multidirectional pathways and ample vacancies are developed here. Machine learning simulations indicate increased pore density within the amorphous VOx structure and highlight atomic&#8208;scale transformations during cycling. These findings advance the design of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.








Abstract
Sodium ion hybrid capacitors (SIHCs) address the high power and energy requirements in energy storage devices but face significant challenges arising from the slow kinetics and cycling instability of the anode side. Introducing atomic disorder and employing structural engineering in anode materials proves to be effective strategies for achieving rapid charge storage. Here, it is demonstrated that N&#8208;doped MXene encapsulated amorphous vanadium oxide hollow spheres (VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs) offer multidirectional open pathways and sufficient vacancies, enabling reversible and fast Na+ insertion/extraction. Machine learning potentials, coupled with molecular simulation techniques, confirm the presence of more abundant pores within the amorphous vanadium oxide (VOx) structure. The simulation of the charging/discharging process elucidates the authentic reaction path and structural evolutions of the VOx@N&#8208;MXene HSs, providing sufficient insight into the atomic&#8208;scale mechanisms associated with these structural superiorities. The full SIHCs devices demonstrate a high energy density of 198.3 Wh kg&#8722;1, along with a long&#8208;term cycling lifespan of 8000 cycles. This study offers valuable strategies into the intricate design and exploration of amorphous electrodes, contributing to the advancement of next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy devices.

         <title>Catalytic Biomaterials&#8208;Activated In Situ Chemical Reactions: Strategic Modulation and Enhanced Disease Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review delves into the modulation of fundamental catalytic reactions, a cornerstone in addressing disease treatment through an interdisciplinary lens. Central to this review's discussion is the regulation of chemical reactions while concurrently accounting for the complex microenvironments of diseases to achieve specificity, efficiency, and control of in situ chemical reactions. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials activated in situ chemical reactions and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.








Abstract
Chemical reactions underpin biological processes, and imbalances in critical biochemical pathways within organisms can lead to the onset of severe diseases. Within this context, the emerging field of &#8220;Nanocatalytic Medicine&#8221; leverages nanomaterials as catalysts to modulate fundamental chemical reactions specific to the microenvironments of diseases. This approach is designed to facilitate the targeted synthesis and localized accumulation of therapeutic agents, thus enhancing treatment efficacy and precision while simultaneously reducing systemic side effects. The effectiveness of these nanocatalytic strategies critically hinges on a profound understanding of chemical kinetics and the intricate interplay of reactions within particular pathological microenvironments to ensure targeted and effective catalytic actions. This review methodically explores in situ catalytic reactions and their associated biomaterials, emphasizing regulatory strategies that control therapeutic responses. Furthermore, the discussion encapsulates the crucial elements&#8208;reactants, catalysts, and reaction conditions/environments&#8208;necessary for optimizing the thermodynamics and kinetics of these reactions, while rigorously addressing both the biochemical and biophysical dimensions of the disease microenvironments to enhance therapeutic outcomes. It seeks to clarify the mechanisms underpinning catalytic biomaterials and evaluate their potential to revolutionize treatment strategies across various pathological conditions.

         <title>Lateral Phase Heterojunction for Perovskite Microoptoelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film is first demonstrated by a developed contact&#8208;diffusion lithography (CDL) for the fabrication of microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (micro&#8208;PeLEDs). Based on the &#945;/&#948;&#8208;formamidiniumPbI3 (FAPbI3) LPH film with high&#8208;resolution patterns and superior radiative performance, a record&#8208;efficiency near&#8208;infrared micro&#8208;PeLED device is achieved to validate the versatile applications of LPHs in perovskite microoptoelectronics and photonics.









Abstract
Perovskite heterojunction engineering is the prerequisite but still a deficiency in the fabrication of micro&#8208;optoelectronic devices, where the present top&#8208;down or bottom&#8208;up techniques mainly focus on preparing the vertical heterojunction stacks. Perovskite lateral heterojunction structures generally rely on epitaxial growth, which cannot meet the demands of mass production of micro&#8208;devices. Here, a contact diffusion lithography technique is proposed to demonstrate a perovskite lateral phase heterojunction (LPH) polycrystalline film by ion&#8208;driven local phase transition. Under the guidance of thermodynamic simulations, methylamine contact and migration collectively promote in situ formation of &#945;&#8208;phase formamidine&#8208;based perovskite patterns surrounded by &#948;&#8208;phase polymorphs. Spontaneous type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment between &#945;&#8208; and &#948;&#8208;phases establishes energy funnels in the LPH film to facilitate carrier utilization and radiative recombination. The wide&#8208;bandgap &#948;&#8208;phase also serves as the coplanar isolator to achieve local anti&#8208;leakage for device integration. Based on the bright and stable LPH pattern layer, the near&#8208;infrared microscale perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode (micro&#8208;PeLED) with impressive device performance is achieved by following conventional device fabrication protocol. The proposed LPH enriches the perovskite heterojunction family, creates a new optoelectronic processing platform, and advances its versatile applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics and photonics.

         <title>Interfacial Engineering of MoxSy via Boron&#8208;Doping for Electrochemical N2&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst demonstrates improved N2 reduction at an onset potential of &#8722;0.15 V versus. RHE, achieving Faradaic efficiencies of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83 &#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in 0.05 m H2SO4(aq). The outstanding NRR performance is attributed to the phase transition of MoxSy, Mo sites, and B doping, which promotes N2 reduction to NH3.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic synthesis of ammonia (NH3) through the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) under ambient temperature and pressure is emerging as an alternative approach to the conventional Haber&#8211;Bosch process. However, it remains a significant challenge due to poor kinetics, low nitrogen (N2) solubility in aqueous electrolytes, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can significantly impact NH3 production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, a rationally designed boron&#8208;doped molybdenum sulfide (B&#8208;Mo&#8208;MoxSy) electrocatalyst is reported that effectively enhances N2 reduction to &#160;NH3 with an onset potential of &#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE, achieving a FE of 78% and an NH3 yield of 5.83&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;2 in a 0.05&#160;m H2SO4(aq). Theoretical studies suggest that the effectiveness of NRR originates from electron density redistribution due to boron (B) doping, which provides an ideal pathway for nitrogenous species to bind with electron&#8208;deficient B sites. This work demonstrates a significant exploration, showing that Mo&#8208;based electrocatalysts are capable of facilitating artificial N2 fixation.

However, it remains a significant challenge due to poor kinetics, low nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) solubility in aqueous electrolytes, and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which can significantly impact NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production rates and Faradaic efficiency (FE). Herein, a rationally designed boron-doped molybdenum sulfide (B-Mo-Mo&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;) electrocatalyst is reported that effectively enhances N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction to &#160;NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with an onset potential of &#8722;0.15&#160;V versus RHE, achieving a FE of 78% and an NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yield of 5.83&#160;&#181;g h&#8315;&#185; cm&#8315;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a 0.05&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(aq). Theoretical studies suggest that the effectiveness of NRR originates from electron density redistribution due to boron (B) doping, which provides an ideal pathway for nitrogenous species to bind with electron-deficient B sites. This work demonstrates a significant exploration, showing that Mo-based electrocatalysts are capable of facilitating artificial N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; fixation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>One&#8208;Step Synthesis of Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclable and Thermally Superinsulating Polyhexahydrotriazine Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The simple one&#8208;step synthesis of closed&#8208;loop recyclable PHT aerogels is presented, which are made from commercially available aromatic amines and PFA. These PHT aerogels display thermal superinsulation, pronounced thermal stability, great mechanical performance, and intrinsic hydrophobicity. Furthermore, PHT aerogels can be depolymerized under acidic aqueous conditions, allowing the monomers to be reused to prepare fresh aerogels.








Abstract
Organic aerogels are an advanced class of materials renowned for their ultralow thermal conductivity and highly porous architecture, making them ideal for applications in thermal insulation, catalysis, and chemical absorption. However, these polymeric networks pose environmental concerns as their permanently crosslinked scaffold makes recycling back to the original monomers virtually impossible. To tackle this issue and develop next&#8208;generation organic aerogel, a set of polyhexahydrotriazine (PHT)&#160;aerogels specifically designed for closed&#8208;loop chemical recycling are prepared. Remarkably, these innovative materials can selectively be synthesized in a one&#8208;step condensation reaction using commercially available aromatic amines. They showcase outstanding thermally insulating performance, along with strong mechanical performance, pronounced thermal stability, and intrinsic hydrophobicity, all achieved without the need for additional modifications. More importantly, these aerogels exhibit quantitative depolymerization under acidic aqueous conditions, achieving high yields and purities of the recovered monomers. The successful preparation of fresh organic aerogels from recycled monomers with nearly identical material properties underscores the efficiency and reliability of this recycling process. The facile one&#8208;step synthesis process, combined with the high&#8208;performance properties and excellent recyclability of these PHT aerogels, accelerates the advancement of sustainable thermally superinsulating materials.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reporting Multiple Microscopic Stresses Through Tunable Microcapsule Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a method for detecting localized stress variations with micrometer resolution. It utilizes embedded microcapsule arrays that fluoresce in distinct colors at specific stress thresholds. First, microfluidic synthesis creates fluorescent dye&#8208;filled microcapsules with precise stress response. Afterward, these microcapsules are organized into arrays and embedded in elastomer films via a capillary assembly process.








Abstract
Self&#8208;reporting materials have emerged as a promising tool for real&#8208;time monitoring of stress and damage in structural materials. When critical stress is applied to these materials, an optical response is triggered &#8211; for example by dye release, or molecular cleavage. A key challenge is to extend these systems to respond to multiple different stress levels. To achieve this, a novel microcapsule&#8208;based assembly strategy is presented. Microfluidic synthesis is used to create microcapsules that release dye at a precise level of applied force. Subsequently, capillary assembly is used to combine microcapsules with different stress&#8208;responsiveness and different fluorescent dyes into chains, which are uniformly patterned into regular arrays, and embed these into the self&#8208;reporting materials. Through indentation experiments, it is shown that these materials can distinguish and record spatially resolved local stresses based on the fluorescence emitted upon microcapsule rupture. Crucially, the technique's accuracy is significantly improved when microcapsules are spatially organized within the material. This versatile technique can be applied to a range of different materials, via the use of thin coatings containing the regularly patterned microcapsule chains.

         <title>Hydronium&#8208;Crosslinked Inorganic Hydrogel Comprised of 1D Lepidocrocite Titanate Nanofilaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently discovered, 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DL) represent a highly scalable &#8220;truly 1D&#8221; material, featuring a cross&#8208;section 2&#160;x&#160;2 TiO6 octahedra thick. Given its extreme dimensionality, 1DL can be considered a TiO&#8208;based analog to polymeric strands and possesses unique self&#8208;assembly properties. Ion exchange with hydronium produces a crosslinked network of the first ever 1&#8208;D titanate&#8208;based, robust, biocompatible hydrogel.








Abstract
When a few drops of acid (hydrochloric, acrylic, propionic, acetic, or formic) are added to a colloid comprised of 1D lepidocrocite titanate nanofilaments (1DLs)&#8211;2 &#215; 2 TiO6 octahedra in cross&#8208;section&#8211;a hydrogel forms, in many cases, within seconds. The 1DL synthesis process requires the reaction between titanium diboride with tetramethylammonium (TMA+), hydroxide. Using quantitative nuclear magnetic resonance (qNMR), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), the mass percent of TMA+ after synthesis is determined to be &#8776; 13.1&#160;&#177;&#160;0.1%. The TMA+ is completely removed from the gels after 2 water soak cycles, resulting in the first completely inorganic, TiO2&#8208;based hydrogels. Ion exchanging the TMA+ with hydronium results in gels with relatively strong hydrogen bonds. The hydrogels' compression strengths increased linearly with 1DL colloid concentration. At a 1DL concentration of 45&#160;g&#160;L&#8722;1, the compressive strength, at 80% deformation when acrylic acid is used, is &#8776;325&#160;kPa. The strengths are &#8776; 50% greater after the TMA+ is removed. The removal of all residual organic components in the hydrogels, including TMA+, is confirmed by qNMR, Fourier&#8208;transformed infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), and TGA/DSC. The 1DL phase is retained after gelation, TMA+ removal, and 80% compression.

         <title>Ultraflexible Vertical Corbino Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Epidermal Signal Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultraflexible vertical Corbino organic electrochemical transistors with a novel 4&#8208;terminal design are successfully developed on a 1&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick parylene film.

Abstract
Skin&#8208;conformal organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) have attracted significant attention for real&#8208;time physiological signal monitoring and are vital for health diagnostics and treatments. However, mechanical harmonization amid the inherent dynamic nature of the skin surface and the acquisition of intrinsic physiological signals are significant challenges that hinder the integration of the ultimate skin interface. Thus, this study proposes a novel 4&#8208;terminal (4&#8208;T) vertical Corbino OECT, exhibiting high transconductance (&gt;400 mS) and offering remarkable resilience and operational stability at an extremely low voltage of 10&#160;mV (1.9% of minimal current change after 104 biasing cycles and endurance up to 103 cycles of repetitive deformation with a 5&#160;&#181;m bending radius). Consequently, ultralow&#8208;power, motion&#8208;resistant epidermal electrocardiogram, electromyogram, and electrooculogram sensors are developed with an exceptional signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 40.1&#160;dB. The results of this study present a significant stride in non&#8208;invasive, skin&#8208;interfaced health&#8208;monitoring technologies and herald a new era in integrative health technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectrics offer structural flexibility and diverse catalytic applications by using metal nodes and organic groups as active sites. This study presents [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 (Cu&#8208;DFCBA) as the first molecular perovskite ferroelectric catalyst for alkane oxidation. It achieves a turnover number of 2402, demonstrating a 1200&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity compared to Barium titanate (BaTiO3) under ultrasound.








Abstract
Organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite ferroelectric has gained significant attention for its structural flexibility and diversity. They can directly utilize metal nodes and organic groups as active sites in catalysis. Additionally, their ferroelectric polarization occurs around these active sites, significantly enhancing catalytic activity and demonstrating immense potential for applications. However, their catalytic applications remain underexplored. This work marks the first utilization of the molecular perovskite ferroelectric [3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium]2CuCl4 (Cu&#8208;DFCBA) as a catalyst for alkane oxidation. Under ultrasonic stimulation, it achieved a remarkable turnover number as high as 2402. Compared to inorganic ferroelectrics like lithium niobate (LiNbO3), the molecular ferroelectric exhibited a 1200&#8208;fold increase in catalytic activity. This highlights Cu&#8208;DFCBA's robust ferroelectric properties and underscores the vast potential of molecular ferroelectrics in catalysis, guiding future system designs.

         <title>Augmenting Protein Degradation Capacity of PROTAC through Energy Metabolism Regulation and Targeted Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is presented to augment the protein degradation capability of proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) by modulating external nutrient supply and employing nanocarrier&#8208;based targeted delivery. The results demonstrate that a reduction in nutrient supply can enhance protein metabolism and significantly improve the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs when combined with nanocarriers.








Abstract
The ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system (UPS) is responsible for degrading over 70&#8211;80% of cellular proteins. Consequently, proteolysis&#8208;targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are developed to induce the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of proteins of interest (POIs) by the UPS. To amplify the therapeutic efficacy of PROTACs, energy metabolism regulation is first harnessed to boost UPS function in tumor cells. Proteomic and ubiquitinome analyzes reveal that total ubiquitinated proteins and proteasome activity are significantly increased in 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells following fasting&#8208;mimicking diet (FMD) treatment. As a result, the degradation efficiency of PROTACs targeting focal adhesion kinase (FAK&#8208;P) or bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4&#8208;P) is significantly enhanced in FMD&#8208;treated 143B and MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumor cells. Then, silica&#8208;coated iron oxide nanoparticles are developed modified with tumor cell membranes for targeted delivery of PROTACs. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and fluorescence imaging confirm that nanocarriers significantly improve the delivery efficiency of PROTACs in FMD&#8208;treated 143B or MDA&#8208;MB&#8208;231 tumors. In vivo studies demonstrate that the antitumor efficacy of FAK&#8208;P and BRD4&#8208;P is greatly augmented when combined with targeted delivery and FMD treatment. Overall, this study presents a strategy to enhance the efficacy of PROTACs in cancer therapy.

         <title>Photoreceptor&#8208;Like Signal Transduction Between Polymer&#8208;Based Protocells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents polymer&#8208;based protocells containing light&#8208;sensitive and catalytic artificial organelles (AOs), forming a communicating protocellular system. Light&#8208;triggered substrate release from AOs in sender protocells is used to relay a signal to a receiver protocell where its conversion takes place in catalytic AOs. This system, modulated by environmental calcium, can enhance the understanding of cellular communication networks.








Abstract
Deciphering inter&#8208; and intracellular signaling pathways is pivotal for understanding the intricate communication networks that orchestrate life's dynamics. Communication models involving bottom&#8208;up construction of protocells are emerging but often lack specialized compartments sufficiently robust and hierarchically organized to perform spatiotemporally defined signaling. Here, the modular construction of communicating polymer&#8208;based protocells designed to mimic the transduction of information in retinal photoreceptors is presented. Microfluidics is used to generate polymeric protocells subcompartmentalized by specialized artificial organelles. In one protocell population, light triggers artificial organelles with membrane&#8208;embedded photoresponsive rotary molecular motors to set off a sequence of reactions starting with the release of encapsulated signaling molecules into the lumen. Intercellular communication is mediated by signal transfer across membranes to protocells containing catalytic artificial organelles as subcompartments, whose signal conversion can be modulated by environmental calcium. Signal propagation also requires selective permeability of the diverse compartments. By segregating artificial organelles in distinct protocells, a sequential chain of reactions mediating intercellular communication is created that is further modulated by adding extracellular messengers. This connective behavior offers the potential for a deeper understanding of signaling pathways and faster integration of proto&#8208; and living cells, with the unique advantage of controlling each step by bio&#8208;relevant signals.

Polymetallic oxides have extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands. Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov) free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides.








Abstract
Polymetallic oxides with extraordinary electrons/geometry structure ensembles, trimmed electron bands, and way&#8208;out coordination environments, built by an isomorphic substitution strategy, may create unique contributing to concertedly catalyze water oxidation, which is of great significance for proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE). Herein, well&#8208;defined rutile InSnRuO2 oxides with density&#8208;controllable oxygen vacancy (Ov)&#8208;free electron polarons are firstly fabricated by in situ isomorphic substitution, using trivalent In species as Ov generators and the adjacent metal ions as electron donors to form orderly and concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures in the tetravalent oxides. For acidic water oxidation, the obtained InSnRuO2 displays an ultralow overpotential of 183 mV (versus RHE) and a mass activity (MA) of 103.02 A mgRu&#8722;1, respectively. For a long&#8208;term stability test of PEMWE, it can run at a low and unchangeable cell potential (1.56 V) for 200 h at 50 mA cm&#8722;2, far exceeding current IrO2||Pt/C assembly in 0.5 m H2SO4. Accelerated degradation testing results of PEMWE with pure water as the electrolyte show no significant increase in voltage even when the voltage is gradually increased from 1 to 5 A cm&#8722;2. The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In&#8208;Ov&#8208;Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov&#8208;electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self&#8208;trapped Ov&#8208;electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long&#8208;term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next&#8208;generation Ru&#8208;based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.

The remarkably improved performance is associated with the concerted In-Ov-Ru-O-Sn substructures stabilized by the dense Ov-electron polarons, which synergistically activates band structure of oxygen species and adjacent Ru sites and then boosting the oxygen evolution kinetics. More importantly, the self-trapped Ov-electron polaron induces a decrease in the entropy and enthalpy, and efficiently hinder Ru atoms leaching by increasing the lattice atom diffusion energy barrier, achieves long-term stability of the oxide. This work may open a door to design next-generation Ru-based catalysts with polarons to create orderly and asymmetric substructures as active sites for efficient electrocatalysis in PEMWE application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A &#8220;phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic&#8221; route from the glass counterparts toward the NIR&#8208;emitting ceramic film for laser&#8208;driven NIR light source is demonstrated. The composite film with high external quantum yield (57.7%) is obtained, and a preeminent NIR output power of beyond 5 W. The electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC delivers 1.6 W of NIR light, enabling night vision imaging over distances of up to 200 m.








Abstract
Ultrabright broadband near&#8208;infrared (NIR) phosphor&#8208;converted laser diode (pc&#8208;LD) as a light source is increasingly essential for improving the sensitivity and spatial resolution of intelligent NIR spectroscopy technologies. However, the performance of NIR pc&#8208;LD is greatly hindered by the low external quantum efficiency (EQE) and poor thermal resistance of phosphor materials. Herein, a highly stable phosphor&#8208;in&#8208;ceramic (PiC) film deposited on high thermal conductivity substrate, in which the NIR&#8208;emitting Ca3MgHfGe3O12:Cr3+ phosphor is incorporated into a glass&#8208;crystallized Ca3Ga2Ge3O12 ceramic matrix, along with the formation of a new type PiC composite material with high efficiency, absorbance, and thermal conductivity, is designed and prepared. The obtained PiC exhibits an impressive EQE of 57.7%, high thermal conductivity of 17.1 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and the PiC wheel demonstrates a broadband NIR emission exceeding 5 W when excited by a 450 nm laser. Finally, a groundbreaking electrically driven pc&#8208;LD device based on PiC achieves 1.6 W of NIR output, enabling multiple intelligent spectroscopy applications in archaeology and night vision imaging. This work paves the way for advancing broadband NIR light sources in a diverse range of photonic applications.

         <title>Vacancies Engineering in Molybdenum Boride MBene Nanosheets to Activate Room&#8208;Temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental realization of 2D Mo&#8208;vacancy molybdenum boride (Mo4/3B2) MBene nanosheets is demonstrated with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic character by selectively etching bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K.








Abstract
The rapid development of low energy dissipation spintronic devices has stimulated the search for air&#8208;stable 2D nanomaterials possessing room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism. Here the experimental realization of 2D Mo4/3B2 nanosheets is reported with intrinsic room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetic characteristics by vacancy engineering. These nanosheets are synthesized by etching the bulk MAB phase (Mo2/3Y1/3)2AlB2 into Mo4/3B2 nanosheets in ZnCl2 molten salt. The Mo4/3B2 nanosheets show robust intrinsic ferromagnetic properties, with a saturation magnetic moment of 0.044&#160;emu&#160;g&#8722;1 at 300&#160;K, while vacancy&#8208;free MoB MBene exhibits paramagnetism. It is elucidated that the Mo&#8208;vacancy defect generates large density of states near the Fermi surface and spontaneously spin&#8208;split bands through first&#8208;principles calculations, which contributes to the non&#8208;zero magnetic moment in Mo4/3B2 nanosheets. This work lays the groundwork for activating the magnetic properties of MBene nanosheets by vacancy engineering, offering the possibilities for development of practical spintronic devices.

         <title>Anomalously High Apparent Young's Modulus of Ultrathin Freestanding PZT Films Revealed by Machine Learning Empowered Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neural network machine learning model is developed to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves, with which anomalously high Young's modulus is discovered of ultrathin PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4 &#177; 12.1 GPa. The enhancement is attributed to flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776; 200 nC&#160;m&#8722;1.








Abstract
The mechanical properties at small length scales are not only significant for understanding the intriguing size&#8208;dependent behaviors but also critical for device applications. Nanoindentation via atomic force microscopy is widely used for small&#8208;scale mechanical testing, yet determining the Young's modulus of quasi&#8208;2D films from freestanding force&#8211;displacement curve of nanoindentation remains challenging, complicated by both bending and stretching that are highly nonlinear. To overcome these difficulties, a machine learning model is developed based on the back propagation (BP) neural network and finite element training to accurately determine the Young's modulus, pretension, and thickness of freestanding films from nanoindentation force&#8211;displacement curves simultaneously, improving the computational efficiency by two orders of magnitude over conventional brute force curve fitting. Using this technique, anomalously high apparent Young's modulus is discovered of 2.8&#160;nm thick PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 (PZT) film as large as 229.4&#160;&#177;&#160;12.1&#160;GPa, much higher than the bulk value. The enhancement can be attributed to the strain gradient&#8208;induced flexoelectric effect, and the corresponding flexoelectric coefficient is estimated to be &#8776;200&#160;nC&#160;m&#8722;1. The method is developed to enable an artificial intelligence (AI) system to study the mechanical properties of a wide range of low&#8208;dimensional materials.

The proposed &#181;LED pixel circuit utilizes IGZO/Te CFETs, which exhibits symmetrical ambipolar behavior. The IGZO/Te heterostructure is confirmed to consist of an amorphous IGZO layer and a hexagonal Te layer using HR&#8208;TEM and GIXRD.

Abstract
This study investigates a micro light&#8208;emitting diode (&#181;LED) pixel circuit using the heterogeneous integration of complementary field&#8208;effect transistors (CFETs). The CFETs are fabricated using a semiconductor layer composed of tellurium (Te) and indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc oxide (IGZO) layers. Te and IGZO layers in the heterostructure IGZO/Te film exhibit hexagonal and amorphous phases, respectively, indicating that each layer maintains independent material characteristics. The fabricated IGZO/Te CFETs exhibit ambipolar behavior with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 2.0&#160;V and field&#8208;effect mobility of 0.74 and 1.42 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type channels, respectively. Inverters comprising IGZO/Te CFET and IGZO TFT exhibit inverting behavior. A &#181;LED pixel circuit is designed using IGZO/Te CFETs based on pulse width modulation (PWM). The proposed circuit uses an inverter structure with IGZO/Te and IGZO to control the emission time, suppressing the wavelength shift of &#181;LEDs depending on the &#181;LED current levels. The operation of the proposed pixel circuit is investigated through simulation and measurement of the fabricated circuit. The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high&#8208;quality &#181;LED displays.

The fabricated &#181;LED pixel circuit successfully exhibits PWM operation, controlling the emission time and luminance. Consequently, IGZO/Te CFETs show promise as devices for high-quality &#181;LED displays.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Three&#8208;Level Chirality Transfer and Amplification in Liquid Crystal Supramolecular Assembly for Achieving Full&#8208;Color and White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from point chirality of small molecules to helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals consisting of chiral nonfluorescent polymers and nematic liquid crystals is constructed. Full&#8208;color and white CPL are realized via further introducing achiral fluorophores. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed.








Abstract
Chiral liquid crystal supramolecular assembly provides an ideal strategy for constructing excellent circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. However, the chirality transfer in chiral liquid crystals normally occurs at two levels from the configurational chirality to the supramolecular phase chirality. The more precise and more levels of chirality transmission are fascinating but remain challenging. The present work reports the first success of three&#8208;level chirality transfer and amplification from configurationally point chirality of small molecules to conformationally helical chirality of helical polymers and finally to supramolecular phase chirality of cholesteric liquid crystals composed of chiral nonfluorescent polymers (P46) and nematic liquid crystals. Noticeably, the helical twisting power of P46 is five&#8208;fold larger than its monomer. Full&#8208;color and white CPL with maximum luminescence dissymmetry factor up to 1.54 and photoluminescence quantum yield up to 63.8% are realized utilizing helical supramolecular assembly combined with selective reflection mechanism. Also significantly, the electrically stimuli&#8208;responsive CPL switching device as well as anti&#8208;counterfeiting security, information encryption, and chiral logic gate applications are developed. This study deepens the understanding of chirality transfer and amplification across different hierarchical levels.

         <title>Biomimetic Structural Hydrogels Reinforced by Gradient Twisted Plywood Architectures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structural design of natural structural hydrogels in crustacean exoskeletons, this work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels with gradient twisted plywood structure. The structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength, modulus, and toughness, coupled with recorded high fatigue threshold, superior impact resistance, and programmable shape morphing capability.








Abstract
Naturally structural hydrogels such as crustacean exoskeletons possess a remarkable combination of seemingly contradictory properties: high strength, modulus, and toughness coupled with exceptional fatigue resistance, owing to their hierarchical structures across multiple length scales. However, replicating these unique mechanical properties in synthetic hydrogels remains a significant challenge. This work presents a synergistic approach for constructing hierarchical structural hydrogels by employing cholesteric liquid crystal self&#8208;assembly followed by nanocrystalline engineering. The resulting hydrogels exhibit a long&#8208;range ordered gradient twisted plywood structure with high crystallinity to mimic the design of crustacean exoskeletons. Consequently, the structural hydrogels achieve an unprecedented combination of ultrahigh strength (46&#160;&#177;&#160;3&#160;MPa), modulus (496&#160;&#177;&#160;25&#160;MPa), and toughness (170&#160;&#177;&#160;14&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), together with recorded high fatigue threshold (32.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2) and superior impact resistance (48&#160;&#177;&#160;2&#160;kJ m&#8722;1). Additionally, through controlling geometry and compositional gradients of the hierarchical structures, a programmable shape morphing process allows for the fabrication of complex 3D hydrogels. This study not only offers valuable insights into advanced design strategies applicable to a broad range of promising hierarchical materials, but also pave the ways for load&#8208;bearing applications in tissue engineering, wearable devices, and soft robotics.

         <title>Tuning Lipid Nanoparticles for RNA Delivery to Extrahepatic Organs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of lipid nanoparticles (LNP)&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This perspective summarizes the recent progress in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs and provides an outlook of shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms.








Abstract
RNA therapeutics have been successfully transitioned into clinical applications. Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are widely employed as nonviral delivery vehicles for RNA therapeutics in commercial vaccine and gene therapy products. However, the bottleneck in expanding the clinical applications of LNP&#8208;based RNA therapeutics lies in the tendency of these nanoparticles to preferentially accumulate in the liver. This challenge underscores the need to design LNPs capable of delivering RNA to organs beyond the liver. In this perspective, recent progress is discussed in developing strategies for designing LNPs to deliver RNA to extrahepatic organs. Organ&#8208;selective targeting capability is achieved by either altering the composition of the LNP formulation or chemically modifying the ionizable lipid component. Both approaches result in changes in the physicochemical properties of the LNPs, which subsequently alters the composition of the biomolecular corona that adsorbs onto its surface following administration. The biomolecular corona is a known mechanism that mediates organ&#8208;selective LNP delivery. Furthermore, this perspective aims to provide an outlook on shaping the next&#8208;generation LNP delivery platforms. Potential efforts include targeting specific cell types, improving the safety profile of LNPs, and developing strategies to overcome physiological barriers against organ&#8208;specific delivery.

         <dc:description>
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a popular subject, and there have been increasing reports on this subject. One challenge in such a situation is reporting appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the others&#8217; results. This paper provides basic information concerning the experimental setup, data acquisition and processing methods, and standardized denotation of photocatalytic performance.








Abstract
Photocatalytic water splitting has become a very popular research subject in recent years. Consequently, it is important to report appropriately standardized experimental data, so that each researcher can properly understand the results generated by others. However, experimental methods and measures of photocatalytic performance are not yet sufficiently systematic. In the present manuscript, experimental procedures and standardization of photocatalytic performance are described in relation to the basic theory of photocatalytic water splitting.

         <title>Nanomechanical Crystalline AlN Resonators with High Quality Factors for Quantum Optoelectromechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators enable low&#8208;noise sensing and quantum technology applications. This work realizes high&#8208;Q nanomechanical resonators in a crystalline and piezoelectric material by exploiting dissipation dilution in a tensile&#8208;strained AlN thin film. This achievement paves the way for hybrid quantum optoelectromechanical devices operating at room temperature.








Abstract
High&#8208;quality factor (Qm) mechanical resonators are crucial for applications where low noise and long coherence time are required, as mirror suspensions, quantum cavity optomechanical devices, or nanomechanical sensors. Tensile strain in the material enables the use of dissipation dilution and strain engineering techniques, which increase the mechanical quality factor. These techniques have been employed for high&#8208;Qm mechanical resonators made from amorphous materials and, recently, from crystalline materials such as InGaP, SiC, and Si. A strained crystalline film exhibiting substantial piezoelectricity expands the capability of high&#8208;Qm nanomechanical resonators to directly utilize electronic degrees of freedom. In this work, nanomechanical resonators with Qm up to 2.9 &#215; 107 made from tensile&#8208;strained 290&#8201;nm&#8208;thick AlN are realized. AlN is an epitaxially&#8208;grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. Nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a Qm &#215; fm&#8208;product approaching 1013 Hz at room temperature are demonstrated. A novel resonator geometry is realized, triangline, whose shape follows the Al&#8211;N bonds and offers a central pad patterned with a photonic crystal. This allows to reach an optical reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out&#8208;of&#8208;plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile&#8208;strained&#160;AlN.

&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; up to 2.9 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; made from tensile-strained 290&#8201;nm-thick AlN are realized. AlN is an epitaxially-grown crystalline material offering strong piezoelectricity. Nanomechanical resonators that exploit dissipation dilution and strain engineering to reach a &lt;i&gt;Q&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &#215; &lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;-product approaching 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Hz at room temperature are demonstrated. A novel resonator geometry is realized, triangline, whose shape follows the Al&#8211;N bonds and offers a central pad patterned with a photonic crystal. This allows to reach an optical reflectivity above 80% for efficient coupling to out-of-plane light. The presented results pave the way for quantum optoelectromechanical devices at room temperature based on tensile-strained&#160;AlN.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Homogeneous Thin Liquid Film on a Single Cross&#8208;Shaped Profiled Fiber with High Off&#8208;Circularity: Toward Quick&#8208;Drying Fabrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Continuous homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is achieved by using cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity. The asymmetric liquid film works synergistically with capillary effect to overcome PRI and maintains a homogeneous liquid film on a single fiber. Using such a facile strategy, quick&#8208;drying fabrics could be realized, offering new prospects for fluid coatings and functional textiles.








Abstract
Quick&#8208;drying fabrics, renowned for their rapid sweat evaporation, have witnessed various applications in strenuous exercise. Profiled fiber textiles exhibit enhanced quick&#8208;drying performance, which is attributed to the excellent wicking effect within fibrous bundles, facilitating the rapid transport of sweat. However, the evaporation process is not solely influenced by macroscopic liquid transport but also by microscopic liquid spreading on the fibers where periodic liquid knots induced by spontaneous fluidic instability significantly reduce the evaporation area. Here, a cross&#8208;shaped profiled fiber with high off&#8208;circularity, featured as multiple concavities along the fibrous longitude&#8208;axis, which enables the formation of a homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber without any periodic liquid knots, is developed. The high off&#8208;circularity cross&#8208;sections help overcoming Plateau&#8211;Rayleigh instability by tuning the Laplace pressure difference, further facilitated by capillary flow along the concave surface. The homogeneous thin liquid film on a single fiber is responsible for maximizing the evaporation area, resulting in excellent overall evaporation capacity. Consequently, fabrics made from such fibers exhibit rapid evaporation behavior, with evaporation rates &#8776;50% higher than those of cylindrical fabrics. It is envisioned that profiled fibers may provide inspiration for the manipulating homogeneous liquid films for applications in fluid coatings and functional textiles.

         <title>The Effect of Organic Semiconductor Electron Affinity on Preventing Parasitic Oxidation Reactions Limiting Performance of n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;type electrochemical transistors generally exhibit lower performance than their p&#8208;type analogs. The origins of the lower charge carrier mobility in electron&#8208;transporting organic semiconducting polymers are explored and observed that parasitic reactions involving ambient oxygen are a contributing factor. It is shown that a molecular design strategy to increase the polymer electron affinity successfully eliminates these reactions.








Abstract
A key challenge in the development of organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting materials (OMIEC) for high performance electrochemical transistors is their stable performance in ambient. When operating in aqueous electrolyte, potential reactions of the electrochemically injected electrons with air and water could hinder their persistence, leading to a reduction in charge transport. Here, the impact of deepening the LUMO energy level of a series of electron&#8208;transporting semiconducting polymers is evaluated, and subsequently rendering the most common oxidation processes of electron polarons thermodynamically unfavorable, on organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) performance. Employing time resolved spectroelectrochemistry with three analogous polymers having varying electron affinities (EA), it is found that an EA below the thermodynamic threshold for oxidation of its electron polarons by oxygen significantly improves electron transport and lifetime in air. A polymer with a sufficiently large EA and subsequent thermodynamically unfavorable oxidation of electron polarons is reported, which is used as the semiconducting layer in an OECT, in its neutral and N&#8208;DMBI doped form, resulting in an excellent and air&#8208;stable OECT performance. These results show a general design methodology to avoid detrimental parasitic reactions under ambient conditions, and the benefits that arise in electrical performance.

         <title>A Multifunctional Anisotropic Patch Manufactured by Microfluidic Manipulation for the Repair of Infarcted Myocardium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch based on microfluidic manipulation is easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallelly packing processes without involving complex machining and strong field stimulation. The multifunctional hydrogel patch can be a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.








Abstract
Engineered hydrogel patches have shown promising therapeutic effects in the treatment of myocardial infarction (MI), especially anisotropic patches that mimic the characteristics of native myocardium have attracted widespread attention. However, it remains a great challenge to develop cardiac patches with long&#8208;range and orderly electrical conduction based on an effective, mild, and rapid strategy. Here, a multifunctional anisotropic cardiac patch is presented based on microfluidic manipulation. The anisotropic alginate&#8208;gelatin methacrylate hydrogel patches are easily and rapidly prepared through microfluidic focusing, ion&#8208;photocrosslinking, and parallel packing processes. The fluid&#8208;based anisotropic realization process does not involve complex machining and strong field stimulation and is compatible with the loading of macromolecular biological agents. The anisotropic hydrogel patch can mimic the anisotropy of the myocardium and guide the directional polarization of cardiomyocytes. In animal model experiments, it also exhibits significant effects in inhibiting ventricular remodeling, fibrosis, and enhancing cardiac function recovery after MI. These comprehensive features make the multifunctional hydrogel patch a promising candidate for cardiac tissue repair and future provide a new paradigm for expanding microfluidic technology to solve tissue engineering challenges.

         <title>Carrier&#8211;Carrier Repulsion Limits the Conductivity of N&#8208;Doped Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combined dependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient on the carrier density shows that the electrical conductivity at high doping is limited by the repulsion of electrons by other electrons. The carrier density nx corresponding to the maximum electrical conductivity coincides with the carrier density at which the Seebeck coefficient collapses onto Heike's law.









Abstract
Molecular doping is a key strategy to enhance the electrical conductivity of organic semiconductors. Typically, the electrical conductivity shows a maximum value upon increased doping, after which the conductivity decreases. This decrease in conductivity is commonly attributed to unfavorable changes in the morphology. However, in recent simulation work, has shown, that the conductivity&#8212;at high doping&#8212;is instead limited by electron&#8211;electron repulsion rather than by morphology, at least for some material combinations. Based on the simulations, this limitation is expected to show up in the dependence of the Seebeck coefficient versus carrier density: the Seebeck coefficient will follow Heike's formula if carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion limits the conductivity. Here, the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are measured as a function of doping for a series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors. Additionally, the resulting carrier density is measured using metal&#8208;insulator&#8208;semiconductor diodes, which link dopant loading and the number of charge carriers. At high carrier densities, the Seebeck coefficient indeed follows Heike's formula, confirming that the conductivity is limited by carrier&#8211;carrier repulsion rather than by morphological effects. This study shows that current models of hopping transport in organic semiconductors may be incomplete. As a result, this study offers novel insights in the design of organic semiconductors.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The growth via chemical vapor deposition of decoupled graphene on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire is introduced. The resulting graphene is lying atop a thin Cu2O layer and is charge neutral, low strained, and easy to transfer. Electrical transport measurements reveal excellent room temperature carrier mobilities, exceeding 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride, thus opening realistic pathways for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.








Abstract
The growth of high&#8208;quality graphene on flat and rigid templates, such as metal thin films on insulating wafers, is regarded as a key enabler for technologies based on 2D materials. In this work, the growth of decoupled graphene is introduced via non&#8208;reducing low&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition (LPCVD) on crystalline Cu(111) films deposited on sapphire. The resulting film is atomically flat, with no detectable cracks or ripples, and lies atop of a thin Cu2O layer, as confirmed by microscopy, diffraction, and spectroscopy analyses. Post&#8208;growth treatment of the partially decoupled graphene enables full and uniform oxidation of the interface, greatly simplifying subsequent transfer processes, particularly dry&#8208;pick up &#8212; a task that proves challenging when dealing with graphene directly synthesized on metallic Cu(111). Electrical transport measurements reveal high carrier mobility at room temperature, exceeding 104&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 on SiO2/Si and 105&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 upon encapsulation in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). The demonstrated growth approach yields exceptional material quality, in line with micro&#8208;mechanically exfoliated graphene flakes, and thus paves the way toward large&#8208;scale production of pristine graphene suitable for high&#8208;performance next&#8208;generation applications.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedle Array Patches for Tunable and Versatile Intradermal Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) have unique geometries capable of delivering both solid&#8208;state and liquid&#8208;state cargo on a single platform. This technology enables tunable delivery kinetics from the order of minutes to hours for small molecules, proteins, and nucleic acids. The modularity introduced by L&#8208;MAPs opens up drug delivery profiles for multiple payloads while enabling ease of administration.








Abstract
Using high&#8208;resolution 3D printing, a novel class of microneedle array patches (MAPs) is introduced, called latticed MAPs (L&#8208;MAPs). Unlike most MAPs which are composed of either solid structures or hollow needles, L&#8208;MAPs incorporate tapered struts that form hollow cells capable of trapping liquid droplets. The lattice&#160;structures can also be coated with traditional viscous coating formulations, enabling both liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;state cargo delivery, on a single patch. Here, a library of 43 L&#8208;MAP designs is generated and in&#8208;silico modeling is used to down&#8208;select optimal geometries for further characterization. Compared to traditionally molded and solid&#8208;coated MAPs, L&#8208;MAPs can load more cargo with fewer needles per patch, enhancing cargo loading and drug delivery capabilities. Further, L&#8208;MAP cargo release kinetics into the skin can be tuned based on formulation and needle geometry. In this work, the utility of L&#8208;MAPs as a platform is demonstrated for the delivery of small molecules, mRNA lipid nanoparticles, and solid&#8208;state ovalbumin protein. In addition, the production of programmable L&#8208;MAPs is demonstrated with tunable&#160;cargo release profiles, enabled by combining needle geometries on a single patch.

         <title>Concave Grain Boundaries Stabilized by Boron Segregation for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concave grain boundaries in platinum nanomaterials are identified as highly active sites for the four&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) due to their unique geometric and electronic structures. The intentional segregation of boron at these grain boundaries significantly enhances their structural stability, establishing them as robust and efficient catalysts for the four&#8208;electron ORR.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is a critical process that limits the efficiency of fuel cells and metal&#8208;air batteries due to its slow kinetics, even when catalyzed by platinum (Pt). To reduce Pt usage, enhancing both the specific activity and electrochemically active surface area (ECSA) of Pt catalysts is essential. Here, ultrafine, grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich Pt nanoparticle assemblies are proposed as efficient ORR catalysts. These nanowires offer a large ECSA and a high density of concave GB sites, which improve specific activity. Atoms at these GB sites exhibit increased coordination and lattice distortion, leading to a favorable reduction in oxygen binding energy and enhanced ORR performance. Furthermore, boron segregation stabilizes these GBs, preserving active sites during catalysis. The resulting boron&#8208;stabilized Pt nanoassemblies demonstrate ORR specific and mass activities of 9.18 mA cm&#8722;2 and 6.40 A mg&#8722;1Pt (at 0.9 V vs. RHE), surpassing commercial Pt/C catalysts by over 35&#8208;fold, with minimal degradation after 60&#160;000 potential cycles. This approach offers a versatile platform for optimizing the catalytic performance of a wide range of nanoparticle systems.

         <title>Stepwise Stiffening/Softening of and Cell Recovery from Reversibly Formulated Hydrogel Interpenetrating Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomaterials that can dynamically change stiffnesses are essential in further understanding the role of extracellular matrix mechanics. Using independently formulated and subsequently degradable interpenetrating hydrogel networks, the stiffening/softening of cell&#8208;laden matrices is reversibly and spatiotemporally triggered. Terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis is permitted in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner.








Abstract
Biomechanical contributions of the extracellular matrix underpin cell growth and proliferation, differentiation, signal transduction, and other fate decisions. As such, biomaterials whose mechanics can be spatiotemporally altered&#8208; particularly in a reversible manner&#8208; are extremely valuable for studying these mechanobiological phenomena. Herein, a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;based hydrogel model consisting of two interpenetrating step&#8208;growth networks is introduced that are independently formed via largely orthogonal bioorthogonal chemistries and sequentially degraded with distinct recombinant sortases, affording reversibly tunable stiffness ranges that span healthy and diseased soft tissues (e.g., 500&#160;Pa&#8211;6&#160;kPa) alongside terminal cell recovery for pooled and/or single&#8208;cell analysis in a near &#8220;biologically invisible&#8221; manner. Spatiotemporal control of gelation within the primary supporting network is achieved via mask&#8208;based and two&#8208;photon lithography; these stiffened patterned regions can be subsequently returned to the original soft state following sortase&#8208;based secondary network degradation. Using this approach, the effects of 4D&#8208;triggered network mechanical changes on human mesenchymal stem cell morphology and Hippo signaling, as well as Caco&#8208;2 colorectal cancer cell mechanomemory using transcriptomics and metabolic assays are investigated. This platform is expected to be of broad utility for studying and directing mechanobiological phenomena, patterned cell fate, and disease resolution in softer matrices.

         <title>Chain Friction and Lubrication Balanced Ultra&#8208;Tough Polyacrylates With Wide&#8208;Span Switchable Stiffness for Strain&#8208;Programmable Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Simultaneously incorporating long alkyl chains and nano&#8208;eutectics in the polymer matrix achieves polyacrylate composites with ultra&#8208;stretchability and high resilience. These properties, along with a wide&#8208;span stiffness variation triggered by the room&#8208;temperature glass transition, enable polyacrylate composites to exhibit biomimetic and time&#8208; or temperature&#8208;programmable deformations. Furthermore, polyacrylate composite artificial muscles can transform thermal energy into mechanical energy to perform work.








Abstract
Natural mollusks perform complex mechanical actions through reversible large&#8208;strain deformation and stiffness switching, which are challenging to achieve simultaneously in synthetic materials. Herein, it is shown that a set of polyacrylates designed according to a chain friction and lubrication balanced strategy shows&#160;ultra&#8208;stretchability (&#955; up to 324), high resilience (near 100% recovery at strain &#8805; 100), and wide&#8208;span stiffness switching (up to 2073 times). The typical emulsion polymerization method and casting technique are adopted to fabricate the polyacrylate films.

&lt;p&gt;Simultaneously incorporating long alkyl chains and nano-eutectics in the polymer matrix achieves polyacrylate composites with ultra-stretchability and high resilience. These properties, along with a wide-span stiffness variation triggered by the room-temperature glass transition, enable polyacrylate composites to exhibit biomimetic and time- or temperature-programmable deformations. Furthermore, polyacrylate composite artificial muscles can transform thermal energy into mechanical energy to perform work.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural mollusks perform complex mechanical actions through reversible large-strain deformation and stiffness switching, which are challenging to achieve simultaneously in synthetic materials. Herein, it is shown that a set of polyacrylates designed according to a chain friction and lubrication balanced strategy shows&#160;ultra-stretchability (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt; up to 324), high resilience (near 100% recovery at strain &#8805; 100), and wide-span stiffness switching (up to 2073 times). The typical emulsion polymerization method and casting technique are adopted to fabricate the polyacrylate films.

         <title>Stable and Highly Emissive Infrared Yb&#8208;Doped Perovskite Quantum Cutters Engineered by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents stable, highly emissive Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) synthesized with zwitterionic C3&#8208;sulfobetaine ligands through a novel method. The Yb&#8208;doped NCs, optimized by machine learning, achieved an infrared photoluminescence quantum yield of 190% approaching the quantum cutting limit. They also exhibit exceptional long&#8208;term stability against heat, humidity, and light, indicating their potential for fundamental research and practical applications.








Abstract
Quantum cutting (QC) allows the conversion of high&#8208;energy photons into lower&#8208;energy photons, exhibiting great potential for infrared communications. Yb&#8208;doped perovskite nanocrystals can achieve an efficient QC process with extremely high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) thanks to the favorable Yb3+ incorporation in the perovskite structure. However, conventionally used oleic acid&#8211;oleylamine&#8208;based ligand pairs cause instability issues due to highly dynamic binding to surface states that have curbed their potential applications. Herein, zwitterionic type C3&#8208;sulfobetaine 3&#8208;(N,N&#8208;Dimethylpalmitylammonio)propanesulfonate molecule is utilized to build a strong binding state on the nanocrystals&#8217; surface through a new phosphine oxide synthesis route. Leveraging machine learning and Bayesian Optimization workflow to determine optimal synthesis conditions, near&#8208;infrared PLQY above 190% is achieved. The high PLQY is well maintained after over three months of aging, under high&#8208;flux continuous UV irradiation, and long continuous annealing. This is the first report of highly efficient and stable perovskite quantum cutters, which will drive the study of fundamental physics phenomena and near&#8208;infrared quantum communications.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional Interfacial Layer Enabled by Gating&#8208;Shielding Effects for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stable Zn metal anode with beyond 9000&#160;h cycling lifespan is developed by introducing trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium as electrolyte additives. The additives enable dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer with a gating effect from pantothenate molecular layer for switching off active water while selectively transporting target Zn2+, and a dynamically electrostatic shielding effect from Ca2+ cations for suppressing dendrites and side reactions.








Abstract
Large&#8208;scale application of low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety and environment&#8208;compatible aqueous Zn metal batteries (ZMBs) is hindered by Zn dendrite failure and side reactions. Herein, highly reversible ZMBs are obtained by addition of trace D&#8208;pantothenate calcium additives to engineer a dual&#8208;functional interfacial layer, which is enabled by a bioinspired gating effect for excluding competitive free water near Zn surface due to the trapping and immobilization of water by hydroxyl groups, and guiding target Zn2+ transport across interface through carboxyl groups of pantothenate anions, as well as a dynamic electrostatic shielding effect around Zn protuberances from Ca2+ cations to ensure uniform Zn2+ deposition. In consequence, interfacial side reactions are perfectly inhibited owing to reduced water molecules reaching Zn surface, and the uniform and compact deposition of Zn2+ is achieved due to promoted Zn2+ transport and deposition kinetics. The ultra&#8208;stable symmetric cells with beyond 9000&#160;h at 0.5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 0.5&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 and over 5000&#160;h at 5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, and an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 with 1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, are amazingly realized. The regulated&#8208;electrolyte demonstrates high compatibility with verified cathodes for stable full cells. This work opens a brand&#8208;new pathway to regulate Zn/electrolyte interface to promise reversible ZMBs.

         <dc:description>
A supercapacitively dual&#8208;state phototransistor is developed with microporous liquid&#8208;solid interface. A supercapacitively photogating effect greatly enhances responsivity up to 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and realizes high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;transduction of solid&#8208;state optoelectronics occurs in semiconductors or their interfaces. Considering the confined active area and interfacial capacitance of solid&#8208;state materials, solid&#8208;state optoelectronics faces inherent limitations in photo&#8208;transduction, especially for bionic vision, and the performance is lower than that of living systems. For example, a photoreceptor generates pA&#8208;level photocurrent when absorbing a single photon. Here, a liquid&#8208;solid dual&#8208;state phototransistor is demonstrated, in which photo&#8208;transduction and modulation take place at the microporous interface between semiconductors and water, mimicking principles of the photoreceptor. When operating in the water, an orderly stacked photo&#8208;harvesting covalent organic framework layer generates supercapacitively photogating modulation of the channel conductivity via a dual&#8208;state interface, achieving responsivity of 4.6&#160;&#215;&#160;1010 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 1.62&#160;&#215;&#160;1016 Jones at room temperature, several orders of magnitude higher than other photodetectors. Such bio&#8208;inspired dual&#8208;state optoelectronics enables high&#8208;contrast scotopic neuromorphic imaging with responsivity greater than photoreceptors, holding promise for constructing optoelectronic systems with performance beyond conventional solid&#8208;state optoelectronics.

         <title>Structural Ordering in Ultrasmall Multicomponent Chalcogenides: The Case of Quaternary Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A study of ultrasmall quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is presented and a correlation between their composition, structural ordering, and optical properties is established. The work starts from the synthesis of Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se nanocrystals, followed by multipronged characterization of their structural and optical properties, and supported by theory calculation approaches. It is concluded that Copper atoms and cationic vacancies work in pairs to emit light from the I&#8208;III&#8208;VI group nanocrystals.








Abstract
The compositional tunability of non&#8208;isovalent multicomponent chalcogenide thin films and the extent of atomic ordering of their crystal structure is key to the performance of many modern technologies. In contrast, the effects of ordering are rarely studied for quantum&#8208;confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals. In this paper, the possibilities around composition tunability and atomic ordering are explored in ultrasmall ternary and quaternary quantum dots, taking I&#8208;III&#8208;VI&#8208;group Cu&#8208;Zn&#8208;In&#8208;Se semiconductor as a case study. A quantitative synthesis for 3.3&#160;nm quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is developed and shown that cation and cationic vacancy ordering can be achieved in these systems consisting of only 100s of atoms. Combining experiment and theoretical calculations, the relationship between structural ordering and optical properties of the materials are demonstrated. It is found that the arrangement and ordering of cationic sublattice plays an important role in the luminescent efficiency. Specifically, the concentration of Cu&#8208;vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu&#8208;vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I&#8208;III&#8208;VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).

     alt="Structural Ordering in Ultrasmall Multicomponent Chalcogenides: The Case of Quaternary Cu-Zn-In-Se Nanocrystals"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A study of ultrasmall quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is presented and a correlation between their composition, structural ordering, and optical properties is established. The work starts from the synthesis of Cu-Zn-In-Se nanocrystals, followed by multipronged characterization of their structural and optical properties, and supported by theory calculation approaches. It is concluded that Copper atoms and cationic vacancies work in pairs to emit light from the I-III-VI group nanocrystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The compositional tunability of non-isovalent multicomponent chalcogenide thin films and the extent of atomic ordering of their crystal structure is key to the performance of many modern technologies. In contrast, the effects of ordering are rarely studied for quantum-confined materials, such as colloidal nanocrystals. In this paper, the possibilities around composition tunability and atomic ordering are explored in ultrasmall ternary and quaternary quantum dots, taking I-III-VI-group Cu-Zn-In-Se semiconductor as a case study. A quantitative synthesis for 3.3&#160;nm quaternary chalcogenide nanocrystals is developed and shown that cation and cationic vacancy ordering can be achieved in these systems consisting of only 100s of atoms. Combining experiment and theoretical calculations, the relationship between structural ordering and optical properties of the materials are demonstrated. It is found that the arrangement and ordering of cationic sublattice plays an important role in the luminescent efficiency. Specifically, the concentration of Cu-vacancy couples in the nanocrystal correlates with luminescence quantum yield, while structure ordering increases the occurrence of such optically active Cu-vacancy units. On the flip side, the detrimental impact of cationic site disorder in I-III-VI nanocrystals can be mitigated by introducing a cation of intermediate valence, such as Zn (II).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity Zinc Anode Enabled by a Recyclable Biomass Bamboo Membrane Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomass bamboo membrane separator with oxygen functional groups is proposed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn anodes. Benefitting from the restrained activity of water molecules and anions, as well as the unique structure of the bamboo membrane, this separator enables Zn electrode to work at high capacity and current density with satisfying coulombic efficiency and lifespan.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have gained attention as viable energy storage systems, yet the occurrence of detrimental side reactions and Zn dendrite formation undermines the efficiency of Zn anodes. Controlling water activity have proven to be an effective strategy in mitigating these challenges. However, strategies such as electrolyte design and electrode protection layer show weakness to varying degrees. Here, a new oxygen&#8208;functionalized biomass bamboo membrane separator (denoted as BM) is proposed to restrain the activity of water molecules. This BM separator features a unique, multi&#8208;tiered 2D interlayer that facilitates rapid ion diffusion. Additionally, the oxygen functional groups of the BM separator can form hydrogen bonds with water molecules, effectively transforming water molecules from a free state to a bound state. Consequently, the Zn/Zn asymmetric coin cell using BM can work at the ultrahigh rate and capacity of 30 mA cm&#8722;2 and 30&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 for more than 80&#160;h while its counterparts using glass fiber&#160;can barely work. Moreover, full cells using BM separator exhibited a capacity retention of 89.7% after 1000 cycles at 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This study reveals the important influence of water&#8208;limited activity on Zn anode protection and provides an avenue for the design of novel separator.

         <title>Squid&#8208;Inspired Anti&#8208;Salt Skin&#8208;Like Elastomers With Superhigh Damage Resistance for Aquatic Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, the introduction of cation&#8208;&#960; interaction into polyurethane constructs a skin&#8208;like elastomer with extraordinary damage resistance properties (103.7 &#177; 45.7 kJ m&#8722;2) and long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt&#160;performance. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for aquatic applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and&#160;harsh oceanic environments.








Abstract
Cephalopod skins evolve multiple functions in response to environmental adaptation, encompassing nonlinear mechanoreponse, damage tolerance property, and resistance to seawater. Despite tremendous progress in skin&#8208;mimicking materials, the integration of these desirable properties into a single material system remains an ongoing challenge. Here, drawing inspiration from the structure of reflectin proteins in cephalopod skins, a long&#8208;term anti&#8208;salt elastomer with skin&#8208;like nonlinear mechanical properties and extraordinary damage resistance properties is presented. Cation&#8208;&#960; interaction is incorporated to induce the geometrically confined nanophases of hydrogen bond domains, resulting in elastomers with exceptional true tensile strength (456.5 &#177; 68.9&#160;MPa) and unprecedently high fracture energy (103.7 &#177; 45.7&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Furthermore, the cation&#8208;&#960; interaction effectively protects the hydrogen bond domains from corrosion by high&#8208;concentration saline solution. The utilization of the resultant skin&#8208;like elastomer has been demonstrated by aquatic soft robotics capable of grasping sharp objects. The combined advantages render the present elastomer highly promising for salt enviroment applications, particularly in addressing the challenges posed by sweat, in vivo, and harsh oceanic environments.

         <title>Toughening and Imparting Deconstructability to 3D&#8208;Printed Glassy Thermosets with &#8220;Transferinker&#8221; Additives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transferinkers are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth. Incorporating transferinkers into 3D printable photopolymer resins leads to improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure into one that can more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis.








Abstract
Thermoset toughness and deconstructability are often opposing features; simultaneously improving both without sacrificing other mechanical properties (e.g., stiffness and tensile strength) is difficult, but, if achieved, could enhance the usage lifetime and end&#8208;of&#8208;life options for these materials. Here, a strategy that addresses this challenge in the context of photopolymer resins commonly used for 3D printing of glassy, acrylic thermosets is introduced. It is shown that incorporating bis&#8208;acrylate &#8220;transferinkers,&#8221; which are cross&#8208;linkers capable of undergoing degenerative chain transfer and new strand growth, as additives (5&#8211;25 mol%) into homemade or commercially available photopolymer resins leads to photopolymer thermosets with substantially improved tensile toughness and triggered chemical deconstructability with minimal impacts on Young's moduli, tensile strengths, and glass transition temperatures. These properties result from a transferinker&#8208;driven topological transition in network structure from the densely cross&#8208;linked long, heterogeneous primary strands of traditional photopolymer networks to more uniform, star&#8208;like networks with few dangling ends; the latter structure more effectively bear stress yet is also more easily depercolated via solvolysis. Thus, transferinkers represent a simple and effective strategy for improving the mechanical properties of photopolymer thermosets and providing a mechanism for their triggered deconstructability.

         <title>Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface for Targeted Reinnervation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal&#8208;muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. After regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) surgery, the eRIPEN demonstrates long&#8208;term contractility for skeletal muscle tissue and positive effect on pain alleviation through innervation.








Abstract
A regenerative peripheral nerve interface (RPNI) offers a therapeutic solution for nerve injury through reconstruction of the target muscle. However, implanting a transected peripheral nerve into an autologous skeletal muscle graft in RPNI causes donor&#8208;site morbidity, highlighting the need for tissue&#8208;engineered skeletal muscle constructs. Here, an engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D skeletal cell printing combined with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane envelop for host nerve implantation. In this in vivo study, after over 8 months of RPNI surgery, the eRIPEN exhibits a minimum Feret diameter of 15&#8211;20&#160;&#181;m with a cross&#8208;sectional area of 100&#8211;500 &#181;m2, representing the largest distribution of myofibers. Furthermore, neuromuscular junction formation and muscle contraction with a force of &#8776;28 N are observed. Notably, the decreased hypersensitivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and an improved tibial functional index from &#8722;77 to &#8722;56 are found in the eRIPEN group. The present novel concept of eRIPEN paves the way for the utilization and application of tissue&#8208;engineered constructs in RPNI, ultimately realizing neuroprosthesis control through synaptic connections.

Notably, the decreased hypersensitivity to mechanical/thermal stimuli and an improved tibial functional index from &#8722;77 to &#8722;56 are found in the eRIPEN group. The present novel concept of eRIPEN paves the way for the utilization and application of tissue-engineered constructs in RPNI, ultimately realizing neuroprosthesis control through synaptic connections.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bidirectional Vectorial Holography Using Bi&#8208;Layer Metasurfaces and Its Application to Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Material&#160;systems with direction&#8208;asymmetric transport properties are scientifically intrguing with various potential applications. This study presents optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve generalized asymmetric transmission for any input polarization. Experimental results demonstrate polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed vectorial holograms, enabling advanced optical encryption and paving the way for future applications in optical computation, sensing, and imaging.








Abstract
The field of optical systems with asymmetric responses has grown significantly due to their various potential applications. Janus metasurfaces are noteworthy for their ability to control light asymmetrically at the pixel level within thin films. However, previous demonstrations are restricted to the partial control of asymmetric transmission for a limited set of input polarizations, focusing primarily on scalar functionalities. Here, optical bi&#8208;layer metasurfaces that achieve a fully generalized form of asymmetric transmission for any input polarization are presented. The designs owe much to the theoretical model of asymmetric transmission in reciprocal systems, which elucidates the relationship between front&#8208; and back&#8208;side Jones matrices in general cases. This model reveals a fundamental correlation between the polarization&#8208;direction channels of opposing sides. To circumvent this constraint, partitioning the transmission space is utilized&#160;to realize four distinct vector functionalities within the target volume. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;direction&#8208;multiplexed Janus vectorial holograms generating four vectorial holographic images are experimentally demonstrated. When integrated with computational vector polarizer arrays, this approach enables optical encryption with a high level of obscurity. The proposed&#160;mathematical framework and novel material systems for generalized asymmetric transmission may pave the way for applications such as optical computation, sensing, and imaging.

         <title>Atomic Confinement Empowered CoZn Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Nanotubes for H2O2 Production in Sequential Dual&#8208;Cathode Electro&#8208;Fenton Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomically dispersed catalyst with CoZn heteronuclear dual&#8208;metal species confined in defect&#8208;rich N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized for driving highly&#8208;selective two&#8208;electron ORR to H2O2 over the entire pH range and direct conversion to solid products for storage/transportation, as well as sequential activation via a regent&#8208;free sequential dual&#8208;cathode electro&#8208;Fenton process for pollutant degradation and detoxification.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are flourishing in various fields because of their 100% atomic utilization. However, their uncontrollable selectivity, poor stability and vulnerable inactivation remain critical challenges. According to theoretical predictions and experiments, a heteronuclear CoZn dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom confined in N/O&#8208;doped hollow carbon nanotube reactors (CoZnSA@CNTs) is synthesized via spatial confinement growth. CoZnSA@CNTs exhibit superior performance for H2O2 electrosynthesis over the entire pH range due to dual&#8208;confinement of atomic sites and O2 molecule. CoZnSA@CNTs is favorable for H2O2 production mainly because the synergy of adjacent atomic sites, defect&#8208;rich feature and nanotube reactor promoted O2 enrichment and enhanced H2O2 reactivity/selectivity. The H2O2 selectivity reaches &#8764;100% in a range of 0.2&#8211;0.65&#160;V versus RHE and the yield achieves 7.50&#160;M gcat&#8722;1 with CoZnSA@CNTs/carbon fiber felt, exceeding most of the reported SACs in H&#8208;type cells. The obtained H2O2 is converted directly to sodium percarbonate and sodium perborate in a safe way for H2O2 storage/transportation. The sequential dual&#8208;cathode electron&#8208;Fenton process promotes the formation of reactive oxygen species (&#8226;OH, 1O2 and &#8226;O2&#8722;) by activating the generated H2O2, enabling accelerated degradation of various pollutants and Cr(VI) detoxification in actual wastewater. This work proposes a promising confinement strategy for catalyst design and selectivity regulation of complex reactions.

         <title>Polyfunctional and Multisensory Bio&#8208;Ionoelastomers Enabled by Covalent Adaptive Networks With Hierarchically Dynamic Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
With dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, a bio&#8208;ionoelastomer featuring covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding is obtained via melt building approach. The multifunction and multisensory capability endow the bio&#8208;ionoelastomer with comprehensive roadmap toward soft ionotronic devices in the field of remotely monitoring, diagnosing multi&#8208;metric, and complex physiological information.








Abstract
Developing versatile ionoelastomers, the alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will boost the advancement of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices. However, meeting the requirements of bio&#8208;derivation, high toughness, high stretchability, autonomous self&#8208;healing ability, high ionic conductivity, reprocessing, and favorable recyclability in a single ionoelastomer remains a challenging endeavor. Herein, a dynamic covalent and supramolecular design, lipoic acid (LA)&#8208;based dynamic covalent ionoelastomer (DCIE), is proposed via melt building covalent adaptive networks with hierarchically dynamic bonding (CAN&#8208;HDB), wherein lithium bonds aid in the dissociation of ions and the integration of dynamic disulfide metathesis, lithium bonds, and binary hydrogen bonds enhances the mechanical performances, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability. Therefore, the trade&#8208;off among mechanical versatility, ionic conductivity, self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing, and recyclability is successfully handled. The obtained DCIE demonstrates remarkable stretchability (1011.7%), high toughness (3877&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3), high ionic conductivity (3.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), outstanding self&#8208;healing capability, reprocessing for 3D printing, and desirable recyclability. Significantly, the selective ion transport endows the DCIE with multisensory feature capable of generating continuous electrical signals for high&#8208;quality sensations towards temperature, humidity, and strain. Coupled with the straightforward methodology, abundant availability of LA and HPC, as well as multifunction, the DCIEs present new concept of advanced ionic conductors for developing soft ionotronics.

         <title>Electro&#8208;Optically Configurable Synaptic Transistors With Cluster&#8208;Induced Photoactive Dielectric Layer for Visual Simulation and Biomotor Stimuli</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insulating poly (1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive can be employed as dielectric layer to develop electro&#8208;optically configurable transistors. By enhancing photoactivity of POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing, devices realize multiwavelength optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3&#8208;bits. The optical synaptic plasticity, biologically degradable dielectrics, and motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device open new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics and bioengineering.








Abstract
The integration of visual simulation and biorehabilitation devices promises great applications for sustainable electronics, on&#8208;demand integration and neuroscience. However, achieving a multifunctional synergistic biomimetic system with tunable optoelectronic properties at the individual device level remains a challenge. Here, an electro&#8208;optically configurable transistor employing conjugated&#8208;polymer as semiconductor layer and an insulating polymer (poly(1,8&#8208;octanediol&#8208;co&#8208;citrate) (POC)) with clusterization&#8208;triggered photoactive properties as dielectric layer is shown. These devices realize adeptly transition from electrical to optical synapses, featuring multiwavelength and multilevel optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3 bits. Utilizing enhanced optical memory, the images learning and memory function for visual simulation are achieved. Benefiting from rapid electrical response akin to biological muscle activation, increased actuation occurs under increased stimulus frequency of gate voltage. Additionally, the transistor on POC substrate can be effectively degraded in NaOH solution due to degradation of POC. Pioneeringly, the electro&#8208;optically configurability stems from light absorption and photoluminescence of the aggregation cluster in POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing. The enhancement of optical synaptic plasticity and integration of motion&#8208;activation functions within a single device opens new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics, synaptic computing, and bioengineering.

These devices realize adeptly transition from electrical to optical synapses, featuring multiwavelength and multilevel optical synaptic memory properties exceeding 3 bits. Utilizing enhanced optical memory, the images learning and memory function for visual simulation are achieved. Benefiting from rapid electrical response akin to biological muscle activation, increased actuation occurs under increased stimulus frequency of gate voltage. Additionally, the transistor on POC substrate can be effectively degraded in NaOH solution due to degradation of POC. Pioneeringly, the electro-optically configurability stems from light absorption and photoluminescence of the aggregation cluster in POC layer after 200&#160;&#176;C annealing. The enhancement of optical synaptic plasticity and integration of motion-activation functions within a single device opens new avenues at the intersection of optoelectronics, synaptic computing, and bioengineering.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A High&#8208;Rate and Ultrastable Re2Te5/MXene Anode for Potassium Storage Enabled by Amorphous/Crystalline Heterointerface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 strongly anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) for fast and stable potassium storage performance. The engineered A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode demonstrates high reversible capacity, excellent rate capability, and superb cyclability, as well as reliable operation in flexible potassium ion full cell.








Abstract
The pursuit of anode materials capable of rapid and reversible potassium storage performance is a challenging yet fascinating target. Herein, a heterointerface engineering strategy is proposed to prepare a novel superstructure composed of amorphous/crystalline Re2Te5 anchored on MXene substrate (A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene) as an advanced anode for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (KIBs). The A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene anode exhibits outstanding reversible capacity (350.4 mAh g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.2 A g&#8722;1), excellent rate capability (162.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 A g&#8722;1), remarkable long&#8208;term cycling capability (186.1 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1 over 5000 cycles), and reliable operation in flexible full KIBs, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art metal chalcogenides&#8208;based devices. Experimental and theoretical investigations attribute this high performance to the synergistic effect of the A/C&#8208;Re2Te5 with a built&#8208;in electric field and the elastic MXene, enabling improved pseudocapacitive contribution, accelerated charge transfer behavior, and high K+ ion adsorption/diffusion ability. Meanwhile, a combination of intercalation and conversion reactions mechanism is observed within A/C&#8208;Re2Te5/MXene. This work offers a new approach for developing metal tellurides&#8208; and MXene&#8208;based anodes for achieving stable cyclability and fast&#8208;charging KIBs.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Separated Nano&#8208;Antibiotics Enhanced Survival in Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Escherichia coli Sepsis by Precise Periplasmic EcDsbA Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise targeting of potential targets in bacterial periplasm is significant for the development of new antibacterial drugs. A class of heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics is developed to overcome multidrug resistance by targeting DsbA. Its cross&#8208;bacterial outer membrane barriers, triggers deformation in situ to inhibit DsbA activity. It further inhibits &#946;&#8208;lactamase activity, thereby restoring antibiotic sensitivity to kill bacteria.








Abstract
Disulfide bond (Dsb) proteins, especially DsbA, represent a promising but as&#8208;yet&#8208;unrealized target in combating multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria because their precise subcellular targeting through multibarrier remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel heterogenization&#8208;phase&#8208;separated nano&#8208;antibiotics (NCefoTs) is proposed, through the co&#8208;assembly of enzyme&#8208;inhibiting lipopeptides (ELp component), membrane&#8208;recognizing and disrupting lipopeptides (MLp component), and cefoperazone. The self&#8208;sorting components of MLp&#160;&#8220;concentrated island&#8208;liked clusters&#8221;&#160;on the surface of NCefoTs promote the efficient penetration of NCefoTs through the outer membrane. Triggered by the DsbA, the precisely spatiotemporal engineered NCefoTs transform to nanofibers in&#160;situ and further significantly enhance the inhibition of DsbA. The hydrolytic activity of &#946;&#8208;lactamase and the motility function of flagella are thereby impeded, confirming the efficacy of NCefoTs in restoring susceptibility to antibiotics and inhibiting infection dissemination. By these synergistic effects of NCefoTs, the minimum inhibitory concentration of antibiotics&#160;decreases from over 300 &#181;M to 1.56 &#181;M for clinically isolated E. coli MDR. The survival rate of sepsis&#8208;inflicted mice is significantly enhanced from 0% to 92% upon encapsulation of cefoperazone in NCefoTs, which rapidly eliminates invading pathogens and mitigates inflammation. The universally applicable delivery system, based on an &#8220;on demands&#8221; strategy, presents a promising prospect for undruggable antibiotic targets in the periplasm to combat MDR bacteria.

         <title>Open&#8208;Source Throttling of CD8+ T Cells in Brain with Low&#8208;Intensity Focused Ultrasound&#8208;Guided Sequential Delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and aPD&#8208;L1 for Glioblastoma Immunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
An &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy for CD8+ T cells aims to enhance immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM). Low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU) guids the sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce T cell exhaustion (Tex), offering a promising strategy for brain tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Improving clinical immunotherapy for glioblastoma (GBM) relies on addressing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Enhancing CD8+ T cell infiltration and preventing its exhaustion holds promise for effective GBM immunotherapy. Here, a low&#8208;intensity focused ultrasound (LIFU)&#8208;guided sequential delivery strategy is developed to enhance CD8+ T cells infiltration and activity in the GBM region. The sequential delivery of CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10) to recruit CD8+ T cells and interleukin&#8208;2 (IL&#8208;2) to reduce their exhaustion is termed an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy. Consequently, up to 3.39&#8208;fold of CD8+ T cells are observed with LIFU&#8208;guided sequential delivery of CXCL10, IL&#8208;2, and anti&#8208;programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (aPD&#8208;L1), compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) therapeutic efficacy is substantially enhanced by the reversed immunosuppressive TME due to the expansion of CD8+ T cells, resulting in the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory establishment in orthotopic GBM mice. Overall, LIFU&#8208;guided sequential cytokine and ICIs delivery offers an &#8220;open&#8208;source throttling&#8221; strategy of CD8+ T cells, which may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <dc:description>
A photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial biohybrid is proposed with Azotobacter Vinelandii (A. Vinelandii) interfaced directly on polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA) for artificial N2 fixation. The rationally designed biohybrid of NiO@PDA/A. Vinelandii biohybrid achieves a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 4.14 &#181;mol h&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N2) conversion to ammonia (NH3) in a mild condition is a big chemical challenge. The whole&#8208;cell diazotrophs based biological NH3 synthesis is one of the most promising strategies. Herein, the first attempt of photoelectrochemical&#8208;microbial (PEC&#8208;MB) biohybrid is contributed for artificial N2 fixation, where Azotobacter vinelandii (A. vinelandii) is interfaced directly with polydopamine encapsulated nickel oxide (NiO) nanosheets (NiO@PDA). By virtue of excellent bio&#8208;adhesive activity, high conductivity, and good biocompatibility of PDA layer, abundant A. vinelandii are effectively adsorbed on NiO@PDA to form NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid, and the rationally designed biohybrid achieved a record&#8208;high NH3 production yield of 1.85&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1/108 cells (4.14&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2). In addition, this biohybrid can operate both under illumination with a PEC model or in dark with an electrocatalytic (EC) model to implement long&#8208;term and successional NH3 synthesis. The enhancement mechanism of NH3 synthesis in NiO@PDA/A. vinelandii biohybrid can be ascribed to the increase of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide&#8208;hydrogen (NADH) and adenosine 5&#8208;triphosphate (ATP) concentrations and over expression of nitrogen&#8208;fixing genes of nifH, nifD and nifK in nitrogenase. This innovative PEC&#8208;MB biohybrid strategy sheds light on the fundamental mechanism and establishes proof of concept of biotic&#8208;abiotic photosynthetic systems for sustainable chemical production.

         <title>Coacervation&#8208;Driven Semipermeable Nanoreactors for Enzymatic Cascade&#8208;Mediated Cancer Combination Therapy with Enhanced Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, a novel type of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicle nanoreactors driven by coacervation, targeting hepatic cancer for delivery of enzyme drugs and sorafenib, which promotes cancer cell ferroptosis and apoptosis, is prepared. This approach not only curbes tumor growth but also activates immune responses, presenting a potent, multipronged cancer therapy strategy.








Abstract
Utilizing enzyme cascades as a promising approach for targeted cancer therapies holds significant potential, yet its clinical effectiveness is substantially hindered by functional losses during delivery. Complex coacervation emerges as an intriguing strategy for designing functional nanoreactors. In this study, a noteworthy achievement is presented in the development of lactobionic acid&#8208;modified tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive polyelectrolyte complex vesicles (HGS&#8208;PCVs) based on bioinspired homopolypeptoids, which serve as a facile, intelligent, and highly efficient nanoreactor tunable for glucose oxidase, hemoglobin,&#160;and sorafenib (SRF) to hepatic cancer cells. The TME&#8208;responsive permeability of HGS&#8208;PCVs enables the selective entry of glucose into their interior, triggering an enzymatic cascade reaction within the tumor. This intricate process generates toxic hydroxyl radicals while concurrently lowering the pH. Consequently, this pH shift enhances the SRF release, effectively promoting ferroptosis and apoptosis in the target cancer cells. Further, the administration of the HGS&#8208;PCVs not only initiates immunogenic cell death but also plays a crucial role in inducing the maturation of dendritic cells within lymph nodes. It stimulates an adaptive T&#8208;cell response, a crucial mechanism that contributes to impeding the growth of distant tumors in vivo, demonstrating the promising potential of PCVs for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Weakening the Space Charge Layer Effect Through Tethered Anion Electrolyte and Piezoelectric Effect Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the space charge layer dilemma, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL.








Abstract
The space charge layer (SCL) dilemma, caused by mobile anion concentration gradient and the rapid consumption of cations, is the fundamental reason for the generation of zinc dendrites, especially under high&#8208;rate discharge conditions. To address the issue, a physical (PbTiO3)/chemical (AMPS&#8208;Zn) barrier is designed to construct stable zinc ion flow and disrupt the gradient of anion concentration by coupling the ferroelectric effect with tethered anion electrolyte. The ferroelectric materials PbTiO3 with extreme&#8208;high piezoelectric constant can spontaneously generate an internal electric field to accelerate the movement of zinc ions, and the polyanionic polymer AMPS&#8208;Zn can repel mobile anions and disrupt the anions concentration gradient by tethering anions. Through numerical simulations and analyses, it is discovered that a high Zn2+ transference number can effectively weaken the SCL, thus suppressing the occurrence of zinc dendrites and parasitic side reactions. Consequently, an asymmetric cell using the PbTiO3@Zn demonstrates a reversible plating/stripping performance for 2900&#160;h, and an asymmetric cell reaches a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art runtime of 3450&#160;h with a high average Coulombic efficiency of 99.98%. Furthermore, the PbTiO3@Zn/I2 battery demonstrated an impressive capacity retention rate of 84.0% over 65000 cycles by employing a slender Zn anode.

         <title>A Recyclable Ionogel with High Mechanical Robustness Based on Covalent Adaptable Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The contradictory requirements of recyclability and robustness of ionogels are resolved by incorporating covalent adaptable networks (CANs), resulting in a closed&#8208;loop recyclable, elastic, tough, durable, and solvent&#8208;resistant ionogel. This ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical conditions and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing due to its recyclability.








Abstract
Ionogels are an emerging class of soft materials for flexible electronics, with high ionic conductivity, low volatility, and mechanical stretchability. Recyclable ionogels are recently developed to address the sustainability crisis of current electronics, through the introduction of non&#8208;covalent bonds. However, this strategy sacrifices mechanical robustness and chemical stability, severely diminishing the potential for practical application. Here, covalent adaptable networks (CANs) are incorporated into ionogels, where dynamic covalent crosslinks endow high strength (11.3&#160;MPa tensile strength), stretchability (2396% elongation at break), elasticity (energy loss coefficient of 0.055 at 100% strain), and durability (5000 cycles of 150% strain). The reversible nature of CANs allows the ionogel to be closed&#8208;loop recyclable for up to ten times. Additionally, the ionogel is toughened by physical crosslinks between conducting ions and polymer networks, breaking the common dilemma in enhancing mechanical properties and electrical conductivity. The ionogel demonstrates robust strain sensing performance under harsh mechanical treatments and is applied for reconfigurable multimodal sensing based on its recyclability. This study provides insights into improving the mechanical and electrical properties of ionogels toward functionally reliable and environmentally sustainable bioelectronics.

         <title>Unveiling Contact&#8208;Electrification Effect on Interfacial Water Oscillation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydration layers near solid surfaces are essential in physicochemical reactions. Contact electrification can alter the hydration layer structure through electrostatic interactions. The oscillation of interfacial water induced by contact electrification resembles that caused by electrochemical processes, offering new insights and evidence for chemically induced changes.








Abstract
Water is crucial for various physicochemical processes at the liquid&#8211;solid interfaces. In particular, the interfacial water, mediating the electric field and solvation effect along with the solid, corporately determine the electrochemical properties. Understanding the interaction between solid properties and the interface water holds significant importance in interfacial dynamics. However, the impact of alterations in the charged state of solid surfaces induced by contact electrification on interfacial water remains unknown. Here, the evolution of atomic&#8208;level resolution maps of hydration layers are reported on charged surfaces using 3D atomic force microscopy (3D&#8208;AFM). These findings demonstrate that electrostatic interactions can reinforce, distort, or collapse the characteristic structure of hydration layers. More importantly, these interactions exhibit interlayer differences and sample specificity in hydration layer structures of different substrates. In addition, similar oscillations of the hydration layer are observed at the electrochemical interface under different voltage biases. This suggests that contact&#8208;electrification has the potential to serve as a novel method for manipulating and regulating chemical reactions at the interface.

The oscillation of interfacial water induced by contact electrification resembles that caused by electrochemical processes, offering new insights and evidence for chemically induced changes.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Water is crucial for various physicochemical processes at the liquid&#8211;solid interfaces. In particular, the interfacial water, mediating the electric field and solvation effect along with the solid, corporately determine the electrochemical properties. Understanding the interaction between solid properties and the interface water holds significant importance in interfacial dynamics. However, the impact of alterations in the charged state of solid surfaces induced by contact electrification on interfacial water remains unknown. Here, the evolution of atomic-level resolution maps of hydration layers are reported on charged surfaces using 3D atomic force microscopy (3D-AFM). These findings demonstrate that electrostatic interactions can reinforce, distort, or collapse the characteristic structure of hydration layers. More importantly, these interactions exhibit interlayer differences and sample specificity in hydration layer structures of different substrates. In addition, similar oscillations of the hydration layer are observed at the electrochemical interface under different voltage biases. This suggests that contact-electrification has the potential to serve as a novel method for manipulating and regulating chemical reactions at the interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Resolution Structuring of Silica&#8208;Based Nanocomposites for the Fabrication of Transparent Multicomponent Glasses with Adjustable Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photochemically curable silicate&#8208;based nanocomposites containing photoreactive precursors allow transparent multicomponent glasses with adjustable properties to be fabricated. After lithographic structuring, the doped nanocomposites are thermally debinded and sintered in order to achieve full densification. This enables the production of complex structured, transparent multicomponent glasses that are difficult to realize using conventional methods.








Abstract
Silicate&#8208;based multicomponent glasses are of high interest for technical applications due to their tailored properties, such as an adaptable refractive index or coefficient of thermal expansion. However, the production of complex structured parts is associated with high effort, since glass components are usually shaped from high&#8208;temperature melts with subsequent mechanical or chemical postprocessing. Here for the first time the fabrication of binary and ternary multicomponent glasses using doped nanocomposites based on silica nanoparticles and photocurable metal oxide precursors as part of the binder matrix is presented. The doped nanocomposites are structured in high resolution using UV&#8208;casting and additive manufacturing techniques, such as stereolithography and two&#8208;photon lithography. Subsequently, the composites are thermally converted into transparent glass. By incorporating titanium oxide, germanium oxide, or zirconium dioxide into the silicate glass network, multicomponent glasses are fabricated with an adjustable refractive index nD between 1.4584&#8211;1.4832 and an Abbe number V of 53.85&#8211;61.13. It is further demonstrated that by incorporating 7&#160;wt% titanium oxide, glasses with ultralow thermal expansion can be fabricated with so far unseen complexity. These novel materials enable for the first time high&#8208;precision lithographic structuring of multicomponent silica glasses with applications from optics and photonics, semiconductors as well as sensors.

         <title>Fluid&#8208;Induced Piezoelectric Field Enhancing Photo&#8208;Assisted Zn&#8211;Air Batteries Based on a Fe@P(V&#8208;T) Microhelical Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the piezoelectric effect of the microhelical cathode poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) under the weak force of water flow, the built&#8208;in electric field can continuously promote the carrier separation and transfer of photocathode through the periodic piezoelectric potential, and effectively accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics, providing a constructive guidance for the development of piezoelectric&#8208;photo coupled assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries can accelerate the kinetics of oxygen reduction and oxygen evolution reactions (ORR/OER); however, challenges such as rapid charge carrier recombination and continuous electrolyte evaporation remain. Herein, for the first time, piezoelectric catalysis is introduced in a photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery to improve carrier separation capability and accelerate the ORR/OER kinetics of the photoelectric cathode. The designed microhelical catalyst exploits simple harmonic vibrations to regenerate the built&#8208;in electric field continuously. Specifically, in the presence of the low&#8208;frequency kinetic energy that occurs during water flow, the piezoelectric&#8211;photocoupling catalyst of poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)@ferric oxide(Fe@P(V&#8208;T)) is periodically deformed, generating a constant reconfiguration of the built&#8208;in electric field that separates photogenerated electrons and holes continuously. Further, on exposure to microvibrations, the gap between the charge and discharge potentials of the Fe@P(V&#8208;T)&#8208;based photo&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air battery is reduced by 1.7 times compared to that without piezoelectric assistance, indicating that piezoelectric catalysis is highly effective for enhancing photocatalytic efficiency. This study provides a thorough understanding of coupling piezoelectric polarization and photo&#8208;assisted strategy in the field of energy storage and opens a fresh perspective for the investigation of multi&#8208;field coupling&#8208;assisted Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Drug&#8208;Free &#8220;Triboelectric Immunotherapy&#8221; Activating Immunity for Osteomyelitis Treatment and Recurrence Prevention</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A drug &#8208;free strategy, namely &#8220;triboelectric immunotherapy&#8221; based on pulsed direct&#8208;current output triboelectric nanogenerators (DC&#8208;TENG) is developed, based on coupling tribological charging effect and electrostatic breakdown effect, performing antibacterial, osteogenic, and immune activation effects for osteomyelitis. This triboelectric immunotherapy features efficient infection elimination and specific secondary recurrence prevention, with innate and adaptive immune&#8208;response activation, and prolonged immunological memory production.








Abstract
Treatment of osteomyelitis is clinically challenging with low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment. Existing therapies are limited by drug concentration and single regulatory effect on the immune network, and emphasize the role of anti&#8208;inflammatory effects in reducing osteoclast rather than the role of proinflammatory effects in accelerating infection clearance, which is not conducive to complete bacteria elimination and recurrence prevention. Herein, a direct&#8208;current triboelectric nanogenerator (DC&#8208;TENG) is established to perform antibacterial effects and modulate immunological properties of infectious microenvironments of osteomyelitis through electrical stimulation, namely triboelectric immunotherapy. Seeing from the results, the triboelectric immunotherapy successfully activates polarization to proinflammatory (M1) macrophages in vitro, accompanied by satisfying direct antibacterial effects. The antibacterial and osteogenic abilities of triboelectric immunotherapy are verified in rat cranial osteomyelitis models. The effects on the polarization and differentiation of immune&#8208;related cells in vivo are investigated by establishing in situ tibial osteomyelitis models and immunosurveillance models in C57 mice respectively, indicating the ability of activating immunity and producing immunological memory for in situ infection and secondary recurrence, thus accelerating healing and preventing relapse. This study provides an efficient, long&#8208;acting, multifunctional, and wearable triboelectric immunotherapy strategy for drug&#8208;free osteomyelitis treatment systems.

         <title>Glucose&#8208;Operated Widget (GLOW) for Closed&#8208;Loop Optogenetic Glycemic Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces GLOWi&#946;, a closed&#8208;loop insulin&#8208;release system combining optogenetics and synthetic biology for diabetes management. Alginate microbeads encapsulating engineered i&#946;&#8208;cells and a probe that emits glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue fluorescence enable precise control of insulin release. Successfully tested in a T1D mouse model, this approach has potential for personalized diabetes treatment.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop control systems for precise control of therapeutic gene expression are promising candidates for personalized treatment of chronic ailments such as diabetes. Pancreatic i&#946;&#8208;cells are engineered with blue&#8208;light&#8208;inducible melanopsin to drive rapid insulin release by vesicular secretion from intracellular stores. In this work, a glucose&#8208;operated widget (GLOW) is designed as a component of a closed&#8208;loop control system for diabetes treatment by employing a probe that emits blue fluorescence in a glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent manner as a real&#8208;time glucose sensor to precisely control insulin release from these i&#946;&#8208;cells. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of the complete control system, the probe is encapsulated together with i&#946;&#8208;cells in alginate&#8208;poly&#8208;(L&#8208;lysine) hydrogel&#8208;microbeads(400&#160;&#181;m in diameter and containing about 500 cells) called GLOWi&#946; (GLOW with i&#946;&#8208;cells), are subcutaneously implanted into type&#8208;1&#8208;diabetic (T1D) mice. Illumination by UV&#8208;A light at 390&#160;nm results in glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent blue&#8208;light emission from the probe at 445&#160;nm that in turn induces glucose&#8208;concentration&#8208;dependent insulin release from the i&#946;&#8208;cells in a fully reversible manner. Activation of the injected GLOWi&#946; at 390&#160;nm for 15 min effectively restores normoglycemia within 60&#8211;120 min in a closed&#8208;loop manner in these diabetic mice. The system is robust, as normoglycemia is well maintained by daily activation for at least 7 days.

         <title>Hole Polaron&#8208;Mediated Suppression of Electron&#8211;Hole Recombination Triggers Efficient Photocatalytic Nitrogen Fixation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
The enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon effect in a locally disordered structure near the pores in KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets accelerates the formation of active hole polarons, effectively preventing the recombination of photogenerated electrons under mild conditions. The atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets demonstrate superior nitrogenoxidation performance, producing nitrate at a rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1.








Abstract
In the pursuit of successful photocatalytic transformations, challenges persist due to limitations in charge carrier utilization and transfer efficiency, which stemming from rapid recombination. Overcoming these limitations necessitates the exploration of novel mechanisms that enhance the effective separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Herein, deviating from the conventional approach of enhancing carrier migration to separate photogenerated charges and extend their lifetime, the proposal is to directly prevent the recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes by forming hole polarons. Specifically, disordered pores are introduced on the surface of KTaO3 ultrathin sheets, and the clear&#8208;cut evidences in electron paramagnetic resonance, photoluminescence, and ultrafast spectroscopy unambiguously confirm the enhanced carrier&#8211;phonon coupling, which results in the formation of hole polarons to impede the recombination of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs. Taking the challenging nitrogen oxidation reaction as an example, it is found that the hole polarons in atomic&#8208;disordered pore KTaO3 ultrathin nanosheets trigger outstanding photo&#8208;oxidation performance of&#160; nitrogen (N2)to nitrate, with a nitrate&#8208;producing rate of 2.1 mg g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. This scenario is undoubtedly applicable to a wide variety of photocatalytic reactions due to the common challenge of charge carrier recombination in all photocatalytic processes, manifesting broad implications for promoting photocatalysis performance.

         <title>Low&#8208;Hysteresis and Tough Ionogels via Low&#8208;Energy&#8208;Dissipating Cross&#8208;Linking</title>

         <dc:description>
Herein, a chemical design of low&#8208;hysteresis and tough ionogels by utilizing low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating yet strong hierarchical nanoarchitectures as cross&#8208;linkers formed via supramolecular self&#8208;assembly is proposed. A fundamental understanding of the mechanism underlying the low&#8208;hysteresis features can serve as a guiding principle for the molecular design of high&#8208;performance ionogels and will facilitate their advancement and application in many burgeoning fields.








Abstract
Low&#8208;hysteresis merits can help polymeric gel materials survive from consecutive loading cycles and promote life span in many burgeoning areas. However, it is a big challenge to design low&#8208;hysteresis and tough polymeric gel materials, especially for ionogels. This can be attributed to the fact that higher viscosities of ionic liquids (ILs) would increase chain friction of polymeric gels and eventually dissipate large amounts of energy under deformation. Herein, a chemical design of ionogels is proposed to achieve low&#8208;hysteresis characteristics in both mechanical and electric aspects via hierarchical aggregates formed by supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of quadruple H&#8208;bonds in a soft IL&#8208;rich polymeric matrix. These self&#8208;assembled nanoaggregates not only can greatly reinforce the polymeric matrix and enhance resilience, but also exhibit low&#8208;energy&#8208;dissipating features under stress conditions, simultaneously benefiting for low&#8208;hysteresis properties. These aggregates can also promote toughness and subsequent anti&#8208;fatigue properties in response to external cyclic mechanical stimuli. More importantly, these ionogels are presented as a model system to elucidate the underlying mechanism of the low hysteresis and fatigue resistance. Based on these findings, it is further demonstrated that the supramolecular low&#8208;hysteresis strategy is universal.

         <title>Porous Magnetic Soft Grippers for Fast and Gentle Grasping of Delicate Living Objects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is designed to address the inherent trade&#8208;off between shape adaptability and payload capacity. The porous structure imparts low impact force and high surface friction, enabling swift yet gentle grasping. PMSGs are integrated with robotic arms and UAVs for the remote gripping and transportation of small animals.








Abstract
Magnetic soft grippers have attracted intensive interest due to their untethered controllability, rapid response, and biological safety. However, manipulating living objects requires a simultaneous increase in shape adaptability and gripping force, which are typically mutually exclusive. Increasing the magnetic particle content enhances the magnetic strength but also increases the elastic modulus, leading to low adaptability and high impact force. Here, a porous magnetic soft gripper (PMSG) is developed by integrating a porous structure into a magnetic silicone elastomer. The design of porous hard magnetic composite is characterized by high magnetization, low modulus, and rough surface. It offers the PMSG good compliance, high gripping force, and low impact force at fast gripping. The PMSG is capable of performing a variety of tasks, including the fast and gentle grasping of delicate living objects. The study provides insight into the design of novel magnetic grippers and may offer a promising outlook for biomedical or scientific applications in the manipulation of delicate organisms.

         <title>One&#8208;Dimensional Single&#8208;Crystal Mesoporous TiO2 Supported CuW6O24 Clusters as Photocatalytic Cascade Nanoreactor for Boosting Reduction of CO2 to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
One&#8208;dimensional mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 based nanoreactors are prepared via the droplet interfacial oriented assembly and crystallisation strategy. The CuW6O24 &#160;cluster incorporated cascade nanoreactor are further constructed and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction with a high CH4 electron selectivity up to 94.3%. 








Abstract
Constructing nanoreactors with multiple active sites in well&#8208;defined crystalline mesoporous frameworks is an effective strategy for tailoring photocatalysts to address the challenging of CO2 reduction. Herein, one&#8208;dimensional (1&#8208;D) mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 nanorod (MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs, &#8776;110&#160;nm in length, high surface area of 117 m2 g&#8722;1, and uniform mesopores of &#8776;7.0&#160;nm) based nanoreactors are prepared via a droplet interface directed&#8208;assembly strategy under mild condition. By regulating the interfacial energy, the 1&#8208;D mesoporous single&#8208;crystal TiO2 can be further tuned to polycrystalline fan&#8208; and flower&#8208;like morphologies with different oxygen vacancies (Ov). The integration of single&#8208;crystal nature and mesopores with exposed oxygen vacancies make the rod&#8208;like TiO2 nanoreactors exhibit a high&#8208;photocatalytic CO2 reduction selectivity to CO (95.1%). Furthermore, photocatalytic cascade nanoreactors by in situ incorporation of CuW6O24 (W&#8211;Cu) clusters onto MS&#8208;TiO2&#8208;NRs via Ov are designed and synthesized, which improved the CO2 adsorption capacity and achieved two&#8208;step CO2&#8211;CO&#8211;CH4 photoreduction. The second step CO&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 reaction induced by W&#8211;Cu sites ensures a high generation rate of CH4 (420.4&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1), along with an enhanced CH4 selectivity (&#8776;94.3% electron selectivity). This research provides a platform for the design of mesoporous single&#8208;crystal materials, which potentially extends to a range of functional ceramics and semiconductors for various applications.

         <title>Planar Deposition via In Situ Conversion Engineering for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; coating is fabricated via an in situ conversion strategy, consisting of a VSe2/ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch and a nano metallic V inner layer with corrosion resistance. This design not only facilitates interfacial ion transfer and electric field homogenization but also enables planar deposition, thereby achieving reversible and uniform zinc deposition.








Abstract
Owing to the considerable capacity, high safety, and abundant zinc resources, zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been garnering much attention. Nonetheless, the unsatisfactory cyclic lifespan and poor reversibility originate from side reactions and dendrite obstacles to their practical applications. In addition to inhibiting the corrosion of aqueous electrolytes, regulating planar deposition is a key strategy to enhance their long&#8208;term stability. Herein, an in situ conversion strategy is reported to construct a protective &#8220;dual&#8208;layer&#8221; structure (VZSe/V@Zn) on zinc metal, consisting of the VSe2&#8208;ZnSe outer layer with low lattice mismatch to Zn (002) plane, and corrosion&#8208;resistant nanometallic V inner layer. Such design integrates superior interfacial ionic/electronic transfer, corrosion resistance, and unique planar deposition regulation capability. The as&#8208;prepared VZSe/V@Zn demonstrates remarkable durability of 238&#160;h at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a high depth of discharge (68.3% DOD) in the Zn||Zn symmetric cell. Even in the anode&#8208;free system, the as&#8208;prepared protective layer can extend the cycle life up to 2000 cycles, with an outstanding capacity retention of 93.1% and ultra&#8208;high average coulombic efficiency of 99.998%. This work delineates an effective strategy for fabricating lattice&#8208;matching protective layers, with profound implications for elucidating zinc deposition mechanisms and paving the way for the development of high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.

         <title>Manipulating the Electronic Properties of an Fe Single Atom Catalyst via Secondary Coordination Sphere Engineering to Provide Enhanced Oxygen Electrocatalytic Activity in Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, an approach to access atomically dispersed Fe sites over a defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon matrix via secondary coordination sphere engineering is reported on. This Fe catalyst presents extraordinary oxygen bifunctional activity in alkaline environments. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies manifest that the unique geometric and coordination structures reshape the electronic properties of Fe sites to afford such high performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction and evolution reactions are two key processes in electrochemical energy conversion technologies. Synthesis of nonprecious metal, carbon&#8208;based electrocatalysts with high oxygen bifunctional activity and stability is a crucial, yet challenging step to achieving electrochemical energy conversion. Here, an approach to address this issue: synthesis of an atomically dispersed Fe electrocatalyst (Fe1/NCP) over a porous, defect&#8208;containing nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support, is described. Through incorporation of a phosphorus atom into the second coordination sphere of iron, the activity and durability boundaries of this catalyst are pushed to an unprecedented level in alkaline environments, such as those found in a zinc&#8208;air battery. The rationale is to delicately incorporate P heteroatoms and defects close to the central metal sites (FeN4P1&#8208;OH) in order to break the local symmetry of the electronic distribution. This enables suitable binding strength with oxygenated intermediates. In situ characterizations and theoretical studies demonstrate that these synergetic interactions are responsible for high bifunctional activity and stability. These intrinsic advantages of Fe1/NCP enable a potential gap of a mere 0.65&#160;V and a high power density of 263.8&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 when incorporated into a zinc&#8208;air battery. These findings underscore the importance of design principles to access high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for green energy technologies.

         <title>Ni&#8208;Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction Toward Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;free mesoporous NiO catalyst with a favorable local reaction environment is reported to catalyze selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2%. The C&#8722;C bond forms via the direct coupling of *CO2&#8208;COOH on NiO, which transforms to ethanol energetically through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The findings provide a new perspective of C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis, distinctive from that on Cu catalysts.








Abstract
The electroreduction of CO2 offers a sustainable route to generate synthetic fuels. Cu&#8208;based catalysts have been developed to produce value&#8208;added C2+ alcohols; however, the limited understanding of complex C&#8722;C coupling and reaction pathway hinders the development of efficient CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols catalysts. Herein, a Cu&#8208;free, highly mesoporous NiO catalyst, derived from the microphase separation of a block copolymer,&#160;is reported, which achieves selective CO2 reduction toward ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 75.2% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V versus RHE. The dense mesopores create a favorable local reaction environment with CO2&#8208;rich and H2O&#8208;deficient interfaces, suppressing hydrogen evolution and maximizing catalytic activity of NiO for CO2 reduction. Importantly, the C1&#8208;feeding experiments, in situ spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations consistently show that the direct coupling of *CO2 and *COOH is responsible for C&#8722;C bond formation on NiO, and subsequent reduction of *CO2&#8208;COOH to ethanol is energetically facile through the *COCOH and *OC2H5 pathway. The unconventional C&#8722;C coupling mechanism on NiO, in contrast to the *CO dimerization on Cu, is triggered by strong CO2 adsorption on the polarized Ni2+&#8208;O2&#8722; sites. The work not only demonstrates a highly selective Cu&#8208;free Ni&#8208;based alternative for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ alcohols transformation but also provides a new perspective on C&#8722;C coupling toward C2+ synthesis.

         <title>Five Volts Lithium Batteries with Advanced Carbonate&#8208;Based Electrolytes: A Rational Design via a Trio&#8208;Functional Addon Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced electrolyte is designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes with hierarchical DFOB&#8208; and PF6&#8208; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation, thus forming a robust and highly stable SEI and CEI. A 5V Li||LNMO cell with advanced electrolyte achieves&#160;88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries paired with high&#8208;voltage LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 (LNMO) cathodes are a promising energy storage source for achieving enhanced high energy density. Forming durable and robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) and cathode&#8208;electrolyte interface (CEI) and the ability to withstand oxidation at high potentials are essential for long&#8208;lasting performance. Herein, advanced electrolytes are designed via trio&#8208;functional additives to carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes for 5&#160;V Li||LNMO and graphite||LNMO cells achieving 88.3% capacity retention after 500 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. Theoretical calculations reveal that adding adiponitrile facilitates the presence of more hierarchical DFOB&#8722; and PF6&#8722; dual anion structure in the solvation sheath, leading to a faster de&#8208;solvation of the Li cation. By combining both fluorine and nitrile additives, an efficient synergistic effect is obtained, generating robust thin inorganic SEI and CEI films, respectively. These films enhance microstructural stability; Li dendrite growth on the Li electrode is being suppressed at the anode side and transition&#8208;metals dissolution from the cathode is being mitigated, as evidenced by cryo&#8208;transmission electron microscopy and synchrotron studies.

         <title>Engineered Nanoparticles for Enhanced Antitumoral Synergy Between Macrophages and T Cells in the Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) enable tumor&#8208;targeted delivery of dual immune checkpoint inhibitors for both T cells and macrophages. Consequently, PMMNPs not only enhance the antitumoral immunity of macrophages and T cells but also foster antitumoral synergy between these cells. This synergy is achieved by promoting tumor antigen presentation and subsequent T cell activation, and inducing the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype.








Abstract
T cells and macrophages have the potential to collaborate to eliminate tumor cells efficiently. Macrophages can eliminate tumor cells through phagocytosis and subsequently activate T cells by presenting tumor antigens. The activated T cells, in turn, can kill tumor cells and redirect tumor&#8208;associated macrophages toward an antitumoral M1 phenotype. However, checkpoint molecules expressed on tumor cells impede the collaborative action of these immune cells. Meanwhile, monotherapy with a single immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) for either macrophages or T cells yields suboptimal efficacy in cancer patients. To address this challenge, here a nanoparticle capable of efficiently delivering dual ICIs to tumors for both macrophages and T cells is developed. These programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1)&#8208;transfected macrophage membrane&#8208;derived nanoparticles (PMMNPs) can target tumors and provide signal&#8208;regulatory protein alpha and PD&#8208;1 to block CD47 and programmed cell death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1), respectively, on tumor cells. PMMNPs enhance macrophage&#8208;mediated cancer cell phagocytosis and antigen presentation, promote T cell activation, and induce the reprogramming of macrophages toward an antitumoral phenotype. In syngeneic tumor&#8208;bearing mice, PMMNPs demonstrate superior therapeutic efficacy compared to nanoparticles delivering single ICIs and non&#8208;targeted delivery of anti&#8208;CD47 and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. PMMNPs capable of augmenting the antitumoral interplay between macrophages and T cells may offer a promising avenue for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A Closed&#8208;Loop Nanosystem Based on Piezoelectric Sensor and Pd&#8208;Nanoshell Photothermal Ablation for Renal Denervation to Treat Hypertension</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing precise, effective, and safe renal denervation (RDN) is crucial for hypertension treatment. Here, the authors construct a closed&#8208;loop system based on a sensing unit of piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensors and a therapeutic unit of photothermal Pd&#160;nanoparticle shell. This nanosystem is capable of monitoring, targeting, and guiding ablation to safely achieve long&#8208;term control of renal sympathetic nerve&#8208;related hypertension.








Abstract
Renal sympathetic nerves play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of hypertension, and renal denervation (RDN) is a new solution for patients with refractory hypertension. However, current RDN techniques show inconsistent results in clinical application probably owing to incomplete endovascular ablation of the sympathetic nerves and a lack of measures to localize and assess efficacy. In this study, a closed&#8208;loop RDN system consisting of a sensing unit with a piezoelectric thin&#8208;film sensor (PTFS) and a treatment unit with a hollow Pd nanoparticle shell (PdNPS) with a diameter of 202.0&#160;nm for photothermal neural ablation is constructed. The PTFS can monitor and collect arterial pulsation and blood pressure (BP) and direct PdNPS to maximize RDN. PdNPS maintains a local temperature of 58&#8211;62&#160;&#176;C under near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II irradiation (1,064&#160;nm) to achieve effective RDN within a range of 90&#8211;120&#160;s treatment window. Photothermal ablation significantly inhibits the activities of renal sympathetic nerves post&#8208;procedure and after one month and reduces the elevation of BP by &gt; 50%. The novel closed&#8208;loop system enables safe and efficient targeting, dynamic monitoring, and ablation of the renal sympathetic nerves. This closed&#8208;loop system provides a new strategy for RDN technology and even for treating sympathetic nerve&#8208;related chronic diseases.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site Molecular Dipole Enables Tunable Interfacial Field Toward Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A family of fluorine terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules is investigated to engineer interfacial properties. Through the tunable interfacial field via tailored side&#8208;chain, a gradient energy level alignment with more favorable energetics is established, and the resulting N&#8208;i&#8208;P perovskite solar cell demonstrates a record high efficiency value of 25.47% together with enhanced long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
The interfacial management in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), including mitigating the carrier transport barrier and suppressing non&#8208;radiative recombination, still remains a significant challenge for efficiency and stability enhancement. Herein, by screening a family of fluorine (F) terminated dual&#8208;site organic dipole molecules, the study aims to gain insight into the molecular dipole array toward tunable interfacial field. Both experimental and theoretical results reveal that these functional interfacial dipole molecules can effectively anchor on perovskite surface through Lewis acid&#8208;base interaction. In addition, the tailored side&#8208;chain with terminated F atoms allows for altering and constructing a well matched perovskite/Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD interfacial contact. As a result, the inserting dual&#8208;site organic dipole array effectively modulates the interface to deliver a gradient energy level alignment, facilitating carrier extraction and transport. The optimal dual&#8208;site dipole trifluoro&#8208;methanesulfonamide mediated N&#8208;i&#8208;P PSCs achieve the highest efficiency of 25.47%, together with enhanced operational stability under 1000&#160;h of the simulated 1&#8208;sun illumination exposure. These findings are believed to provide insight into the design of dual&#8208;site molecular dipole with sufficient interfacial tunability for perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Microfluidic Platform for Generating and Releasing Patient&#8208;Derived Cancer Organoids with Diverse Shapes: Insight into Shape&#8208;Dependent Tumor Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
ReSCUE (Recoverable&#8208;Spheroid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip with Unrestricted External Shape), a multi&#8208;layer microfluidic platform that facilitates the generation and selective release of uniformly sized soft matter structures, including organoids and tumoroids is introduced. This platform allows for targeted recovery and in&#8208;depth analysis of breast cancer patient&#8208;derived organoids (PDOs), enabling investigations into how tumor morphology influences tumor growth and cancer cell proliferation.








Abstract
Multicellular spheroids and patient&#8208;derived organoids find many applications in fundamental research, drug discovery, and regenerative medicine. Advances in the understanding and recapitulation of organ functionality and disease development require the generation of complex organoid models, including organoids with diverse morphologies. Microfluidics&#8208;based cell culture platforms enable time&#8208;efficient confined organoid generation. However, the ability to form organoids with different shapes with a subsequent transfer from microfluidic devices to unconstrained environments for studies of morphology&#8208;dependent organoid growth is yet to be demonstrated. Here, a microfluidic platform is introduced that enables high&#8208;fidelity formation and addressable release of breast cancer organoids with diverse shapes. Using this platform, the impact of organoid morphology on their growth in unconstrained biomimetic hydrogel is explored. It is shown that proliferative cancer cells tend to localize in high positive curvature organoid regions, causing their faster growth, while the overall growth pattern of organoids with diverse shapes tends to reduce interfacial tension at the organoid&#8208;hydrogel interface. In addition to the formation of organoids with diverse morphologies, this platform can be integrated into multi&#8208;tissue micro&#8208;physiological systems.

         <title>Sliding Ferroelectricity Induced Ultrafast Switchable Photovoltaic Response in &#949;&#8208;InSe Layers</title>

This work demonstrates the odd&#8208;even layer&#8208;dependence of out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity in &#949;&#8208;InSe. The device based on the &#949;&#8208;InSe achieves an on/off ratio of 10&#8308; in ferroelectric tunneling junction and ultrafast bulk photovoltaic response in photodetector in the near&#8208;infrared band. Moreover, the photoresponse in &#949;&#8208;InSe can even exceed graphene in the same conditions, confirming the possibility of application in multifunctional devices.








Abstract
2D sliding ferroelectric semiconductors have greatly expanded the ferroelectrics family with the flexibility of bandgap and material properties, which hold great promise for ultrathin device applications that combine ferroelectrics with optoelectronics. Besides the induced different resistance states for non&#8208;volatile memories, the switchable ferroelectric polarizations can also modulate the photogenerated carriers for potentially ultrafast optoelectronic devices. Here, it is demonstrated that the room temperature sliding ferroelectricity can be used for ultrafast switchable photovoltaic response in &#949;&#8208;InSe layers. By first&#8208;principles calculations and experimental characterizations, it is revealed that the ferroelectricity with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OOP) polarization only exists in even layer &#949;&#8208;InSe. The ferroelectricity is also demonstrated in &#949;&#8208;InSe&#8208;based vertical devices, which exhibit high on&#8208;off ratios (&#8776;104) and non&#8208;volatile storage capabilities. Moreover, the OOP ferroelectricity enables an ultrafast (&#8776;3&#160;ps) bulk photovoltaic response in the near&#8208;infrared band, rendering it a promising material for self&#8208;powered reconfigurable and ultrafast photodetector. This work reveals the essential role of ferroelectric polarization on the photogenerated carrier dynamics and paves the way for hybrid multifunctional ferroelectric and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>A Minimalist Pathogen&#8208;Like Sugar Nanovaccine for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>

Carbon chain&#8208;modified mannan, derived from yeast, demonstrates exceptional capabilities in antigen encapsulation and cross&#8208;presentation, coupled with enhanced activation of dendritic cells through the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, which leads to robust activation of antigen&#8208;specific T cells. When combined with anti&#8208;PD L1, this nanovaccine can unleash formidable antitumor immune responses, working synergistically to inhibit the growth of established tumors.








Abstract
Pathogen&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles have emerged at the forefront of vaccine delivery technology, offering potent immune activation and excellent biocompatibility. Among these innovative carriers, mannan, a critical component of yeast cell walls, shows promise as an exemplary vaccine carrier. Nevertheless, it faces challenges like unpredictable immunogenicity, rapid elimination, and limited antigen loading due to high water solubility. Herein, mannan with varying carbon chain ratios is innovatively modified, yielding a series of dodecyl chains modified mannan (Mann&#8208;C12). Through meticulous screening, a mannan variant with a 40% grafting ratio is pinpointed as the optimal vaccine carrier. Further RNA sequencing confirms that Mann&#8208;C12 exhibits desired immunostimulatory characteristics. Coupled with antigen peptides, Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280 nanovaccine initiates the maturation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells by activating the TLR4 and Dectin&#8208;2 pathways, significantly boosting antigen utilization and sparking antigen&#8208;specific immune responses. In vivo, experiments utilizing the B16&#8208;OVA tumor model underscore the exceptional preventive capabilities of Mann&#8208;C12/OVA257&#8208;280. Notably, when combined with immune checkpoint blockade therapy, it displays a profound synergistic effect, leading to marked inhibition of tumor growth. Thus, the work has yielded a pathogen&#8208;like nanovaccine that is both simple to prepare and highly effective, underscoring the vast potential of mannan&#8208;modified nanovaccines in the realm of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>A &#8220;Two&#8208;Pronged&#8221; Strategy to Boost Hydrogen Evolution Kinetics on NiFe&#8208;Based (Oxy)hydroxides via Oxygen Deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe Coordinate Structures for Ultra&#8208;Stable Ampere&#8208;Level Alkaline Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Benefiting from excellent HER and oxygen evolution reaction activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits feasibility and practicability for industrial applications.








Abstract
NiFe (oxy)hydroxides have been regarded as one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts for oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Unfortunately, the sluggish hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) kinetics limit its application as bifunctional electrocatalyst for alkaline overall water splitting (OWS). Herein, a &#8220;two&#8208;pronged&#8221; strategy is proposed to construct highly active oxygen deficient Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Fe coordinate structures in NiFe (oxy)hydroxide (NFM&#8208;OVR/NF), which simultaneously reduces the energy barrier of Volmer and Heyrovsky steps during alkaline HER process and significantly accelerate the reaction kinetics. Consequently, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF delivers overpotentials as low as 25 and 234&#160;mV to achieve 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, respectively. Furthermore, benefiting from excellent HER and OER activity, NFM&#8208;OVR/NF exhibits a remarkable OWS activity with cell voltages of 1.44&#160;V and 1.77&#160;V at 10 and 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 1.0&#160;M KOH, and displays ultralong&#8208;term stability for 600&#160;h at 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, while remaining durable for 300&#160;h in an alkaline water electrolyzer in 30% KOH at 80&#160;&#176;C. The calculated price per gallon of gasoline equivalent for the produced H2 is $ 0.92, which is much lower than 2026 U.S. Department of Energy target ($ 2.00), demonstrating feasibility and practicability of NFM&#8208;OVR/NF for industrial applications.

         <title>Biomimetic Multichannel Silk Nerve Conduits With Multicellular Spatiotemporal Distributions for Spinal Cord Injury Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions in its hierarchical channel structures is presented. It is further demonstrated in rats that the BNC@MSCs/SCs can facilitate nerve regeneration and function recovery after spinal cord injury (SCI).








Abstract
Bioengineered nerve conduits have shown great promise for spinal cord injury (SCI) repair, while their practical values are limited by poor regenerative efficacy and lack of multi&#8208;level structural design. Here, inspired by the ingenious anatomy of natural spinal cords, a biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduit (namely BNC@MSCs/SCs) with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions for effective SCI repair is presented. The biomimetic silk nerve conduit (BNC) with hierarchical channels and aligned pore structures is prepared via a modified directional freeze&#8208;casting strategy. Such hierarchical structures provide appropriate space for the mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and Schwann cells (SCs) settled in specific channels, which contributes to the generation of BNC@MSCs/SCs resembling the cellular spatiotemporal distributions of natural spinal cords. The in vitro results reveal the facilitated SC migration and MSC differentiation in such BNC@MSCs/SCs multicellular system, which further promotes the tube formation and cell migration of endothelial cells as well as M2 polarization of macrophages. Moreover, BNC@MSCs/SCs can effectively promote the tissue repair and function recovery in SCI rats by attenuating glial scar formation while promoting neuron regeneration and myelin sheath reconstruction. Thus, it is believed that the biomimetic multichannel silk nerve conduits with multicellular spatiotemporal distributions are valuable for SCI repair and other neural tissue regeneration.

         <title>Tyrosinase&#8208;Woven Melanin Nets for Melanoma Therapy through Targeted Mitochondrial Tethering and Enhanced Photothermal Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polysaccharide dually&#8208;tagged with tyrosine and triphenylphosphine is designed for targeted cross&#8208;linking of mitochondria in melanoma cells, effectively slowing down tumor metabolism and growth. Additionally, it promoted the production of artificial melanin and enhanced the photothermal conversion efficiency. These findings introduce a catalytic cross&#8208;linking strategy, offering a new avenue for controlling cellular metabolism combined with photothermal therapy for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Manipulating intracellular biological processes and organelles has emerged as a pivotal strategy to influence cellular physiological functions. Mitochondria, recognized as the powerhouse of cells, play a crucial role in tumorigenesis and progression. Inspired by the Nature's tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed melanin formation within melanoma cells, here an approach is developed using a polysaccharide dually&#8208;functionalized with tyrosine and triphenylphosphine (TPP) for targeted mitochondria cross&#8208;linking in melanoma cells. This technique intricately weaves melanin nets within the cells, serving as a tether for the mitochondria and effectively decelerating tumor metabolism through nanoparticle&#8208;net transformation. Tyrosinase acts as the &#8220;needle&#8221;, while the functionalized polysaccharide serves as the &#8220;string&#8221; successfully constructing nets within the cell. Furthermore, the tyrosinase&#8208;catalyzed cross&#8208;linking of tyrosine not only facilitates the production of artificial melanin but also enhances the photothermal conversion efficiency of melanoma cells, leading to decrease of the tumor growth. This study unveils a non&#8208;drug method for regulating organelle physiological activity and introduces photothermal treatment. This work not only sheds light on the manipulation of cellular functions but also holds promise for advancing cancer therapeutic strategies.

         <title>Sea Cucumber&#8208;Inspired Polyurethane Demonstrating Record&#8208;Breaking Mechanical Properties in Room&#8208;Temperature Self&#8208;Healing Ionogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sea cucumber&#8208;inspired polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized, which is instrumental in the creation of self&#8208;healing ionogels. The polyurethane forms dynamic hard&#8208;phase regions within the ionogels, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds. This unique phase separation structure not only significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the ionogels but also ensures their self&#8208;healing capability at room temperature.








Abstract
Practical applications of existing self&#8208;healing ionogels are often hindered by the trade&#8208;off between their mechanical robustness, ionic conductivity, and temperature requirements for their self&#8208;healing ability. Herein, this challenge is addressed by drawing inspiration from sea cucumber. A polyurethane containing multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond donors and acceptors is synthesized and used to fabricate room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels with excellent mechanical properties, high ionic conductivity, puncture resistance, and impact resistance. The hard segments of polyurethane, driven by multiple hydrogen bonds, coalesce into hard phase regions, which can efficiently dissipate energy through the reversible disruption and reformation of multiple hydrogen bonds. Consequently, the resulting ionogels exhibit record&#8208;high tensile strength and toughness compared to other room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ionogels. Furthermore, the inherent reversibility of multiple hydrogen bonds within the hard phase regions allows the ionogels to spontaneously and efficiently self&#8208;heal damaged mechanical properties and ionic conductivity multiple times at room temperature. To underscore their application potential, these ionogels are employed as electrolytes in the fabrication of electrochromic devices, which exhibit excellent and stable electrochromic performance, repeatable healing ability, and satisfactory impact resistance. This study presents a novel strategy for the fabrication of ionogels with exceptional mechanical properties and room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing capability.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Yet Sustainable Triboelectric Nanogenerator Based on Sulfur&#8208;Rich Polymer Composite with MXene Segregated Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Elemental sulfur&#160;generated from petroleum refining as a huge waste&#160;is upcycled to sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)&#160;and this new polymer is applied to construct a sustainable and high&#8208;performance triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). TENG output performance is maximized by introducing MXene segregated&#160;structure integrated sulfur&#8208;rich polymer/MXene composite. This TENG demonstrated 8.4 times higher peak power density than that of the previous record from SRP&#8208;based TENGs.









Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) typically employ fluoropolymers, highly negative chargeable materials in triboelectric series. However, many researchers nowadays are concerned about environmental pollution caused by poly&#8208;and per&#8208;fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) due to their critical immunotoxicity as fluoropolymers are likely to release PFAS into the ecosystem during their life cycle. Herein, a sulfur&#8208;rich polymer (SRP)/MXene composite, offering high&#8208;performance yet sustainable TENG is developed. Value&#8208;addition of sulfur into SRP&#8208;based TENG has huge advantages since sulfur is abundant waste from petroleum refining and possesses the highest electron affinity (&#8722;200&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) among polymerizable atoms. MXene segregated structure is introduced into SRP to achieve homogeneous distribution without electrical percolation by utilizing below 0.5&#160;wt% of MXene, resulting in a significantly enhanced dielectric constant without a drastic increase of dielectric loss. Due to homogeneous MXene distribution, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG demonstrates 2.9 times and 19.5 times enhances peak voltage and peak current compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs. Additionally, it exhibits reusability without critical reduction of modulus and TENG performance due to dynamically exchangeable disulfide bonds. Finally, after the corona discharging and scaling&#8208;up process to a 4&#8208;inch wafer size, SRP/MXene composite&#8208;based TENG exhibits an 8.4 times improvement in peak power density, reaching 3.80&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;2 compared to previous SRP&#8208;based TENGs.

         <title>Cu/CuxO/Graphdiyne Tandem Catalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrocatalyst of Cu/CuxO nanoparticles on graphdiyne (Cu/CuxO/GDY) with tandem catalytic mechanism is successfully designed. The Cu/CuxO/GDY catalyst exhibits high NH3 yield rate and Faradaic efficiency for electrocatalytic nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR), revealing the enormous potentials of graphdiyne as a tandem catalyst to improve NO3RR kinetics and providing a new direction for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic reduction reaction of nitrate (NO3&#8722;) to ammonia (NH3) is a feasible way to achieve artificial nitrogen cycle. However, the low yield rate and poor selectivity toward NH3 product is a technical challenge. Here a graphdiyne (GDY)&#8208;based tandem catalyst featuring Cu/CuxO nanoparticles anchored to GDY support (termed Cu/CuxO/GDY) for efficient electrocatalytic NO3&#8722; reduction is presented. A high NH3 yield rate of 25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1 (25.4&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) with a Faradaic efficiency of 99.8% at an applied potential of &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus RHE using the designed catalyst is achieved. These performance metrics outperform most reported NO3&#8722; to NH3 catalysts in the alkaline media. Electrochemical measurements and density functional theory reveal that the NO3&#8722; preferentially attacks Cu/CuxO, and the GDY can effectively catalyze the reduction of NO2&#8722; to NH3. This work highlights the efficacy of GDY as a new class of tandem catalysts for the artificial nitrogen cycle and provides powerful guidelines for the design of tandem electrocatalysts.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Activated Probiotics Vesicles Coating for Titanium Implant Infections Through Bacterial Cuproptosis&#8208;Like Death and Immunoregulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers develop an innovative coating for titanium implants that combats infections and promotes healing. By combining ultrasound&#8208;activated metal&#8208;organic frameworks and probiotics, the coating triggers bacterial death and immune responses, enhancing antibacterial and bone regeneration effects. This method shows promise for preventing implant&#8208;related infections and promoting recovery, representing a significant advancement in medical implants.








Abstract
Implant&#8208;associated infections (IAIs) are the main cause of prosthetic implant failure. Bacterial biofilms prevent antibiotic penetration, and the unique metabolic conditions in hypoxic biofilm microenvironment may limit the efficacy of conventional antibiotic treatment. Escaping survival bacteria may not be continually eradicated, resulting in the recurrence of IAIs. Herein, a sonosensitive metal&#8208;organic framework of Cu&#8208;TCPP (tetrakis(4&#8208;carboxyphenyl) porphyrin) nanosheets and tinidazole doped probiotic&#8208;derived membrane vesicles (OMVs) with high&#8208;penetration sonodynamic therapy (SDT), bacterial metabolic state interference, and bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death to eradicate IAIs is proposed. The Cu&#8208;TCPP can convert O2 to toxic 1O2 through SDT in the normoxic conditions, enhancing the hypoxic microenvironment and activating the antibacterial activity of tinidazole. The released Cu(II) under ultrasound can be converted to Cu(I) by exogenous poly(tannic acid) (pTA) and endogenous glutathione. The disruption of the bacterial membrane by SDT can enhance the Cu(I) transporter activity. Transcriptomics indicate that the SDT&#8208;enhanced Cu(I) overload and hypoxia&#8208;activated therapy hinder the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA), leading to bacterial cuproptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, the OMVs&#8208;activated therapy can polarize macrophages to a M2&#8208;like phenotype and facilitate bone repair. The sonodynamic biofilm microenvironment modulation strategy, whereby the hypoxia&#8208;enhanced microenvironment is potentiated to synergize SDT with OMVs&#8208;activated therapy, provides an effective strategy for antibacterial and osteogenesis performance.

This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. The autotester enables OTFT research acceleration within the large parameter spaces created by both diverse material roles and device architectures.








Abstract
Automation is vital to accelerating research. In recent years,&#160;the application of self&#8208;driving labs to materials discovery and device optimization has highlighted many benefits and challenges inherent to these new technologies. Successful automated workflows offer tangible benefits to fundamental science and industrial scale&#8208;up by significantly increasing productivity and reproducibility all while enabling entirely new types of experiments. However, it's implemtation is often time&#8208;consuming and cost&#8208;prohibitive and necessitates establishing multidisciplinary teams that bring together domain&#8208;specific knowledge with specific skillsets in computer science and engineering. This perspective article provides a comprehensive overview of how the research group has adopted &#8220;hybrid automation&#8221; over the last 8 years by using simple automatic electrical testers (autotesters) as a tool to increase productivity and enhance reproducibility in organic thin film transistor (OTFT) research. From wearable and stretchable electronics to next&#8208;generation sensors and displays, OTFTs have the potential to be a key technology that will enable new applications from health to aerospace. The combination of materials chemistry, device manufacturing, thin film characterization and electrical engineering makes OTFT research challenging due to the large parameter space created by both diverse material roles and device architectures. Consequently, this research stands to benefit enormously from automation. By leveraging the multidisciplinary team and taking a user&#8208;centered design approach in the design and continued improvement of the autotesters, the group has meaningfully increased productivity, explored research avenues impossible with traditional workflows, and developed as scientists and engineers capable of effectively designing and leveraging automation to build the future of their fields to encourage this approach, the files for replicating the infrastructure are included, and questions and potential
collaborations are welcomed.

         <title>High Sensitivity X&#8208;Ray Detectors with Low Degradation Based on Deuterated Halide Perovskite Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy to achieve ultrasensitive and stable X&#8208;ray detectors through isotope engineering is developed. The ion migration of organic&#8208;inorganic perovskite single crystals is significantly suppressed, achieving five times higher stability and X&#8208;ray detection performance. The progress of this paper provides a new route to accelerate the adoption of perovskites in X&#8208;ray imaging and medical applications.








Abstract
Methylammonium lead single crystal (MAPbI3 SC) possesses superior optoelectronic properties and low manufacturing cost, making it an ideal candidate for X&#8208;ray detection. However, the ionic migration of the perovskites usually leads to instability, dark current drift, and hysteresis of the detector, limiting their applications in well&#8208;established technologies. Here, a series of X&#8208;ray detectors of MAPbI3 SCs are reported with different degrees of deuteration (DxMAPbI3, x = 0, 0.15, 0.75, 0.99). By controlling the content of deuterium (D) in organic cations, the sensitivity, detection limits, ion migration, and resistivity of the detector can be controlled, thereby improving its performance. Due to stronger hydrogen bonds (N&#9472;D&#183;&#183;&#183;I), the ion activation energy significantly increases to 886 meV. Consequently, the D0.99MAPbI3 SC detector shows more than five&#8208;fold enhancement, achieving a record&#8208;high mobility&#8211;lifetime (&#181;&#964;) product of 5.39&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8722;2&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, with an ultrahigh sensitivity of 2.18 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gy&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 under 120&#160;keV hard X&#8208;ray and a low detection limit of 4.8 nGyair s&#8722;1, as well as long&#8208;term stability. The study provides a straightforward strategy for constructing ultrasensitive X&#8208;ray detection and imaging systems based on perovskite SCs.

         <title>Scalable Layer&#8208;Controlled Oxidation of Bi2O2Se for Self&#8208;Rectifying Memristor Arrays With sub&#8208;pA Sneak Currents</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving controllable oxidation of single&#8208;crystal Bi2O2Se through the development of large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation allowed for the construction of &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor exhibited remarkable self&#8208;rectifying memristive performance, including ultra&#8208;high ON/OFF and rectification ratios, and nonlinearity. The scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying memristor arrays is successfully demonstrated, showcasing sub&#8208;pA sneak currents, desirable to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays.








Abstract
Smart memristors with innovative properties are crucial for the advancement of next&#8208;generation information storage and bioinspired neuromorphic computing. However, the presence of significant sneak currents in large&#8208;scale memristor arrays results in operational errors and heat accumulation, hindering their practical utility. This study successfully synthesizes a quasi&#8208;free&#8208;standing Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystalline film and achieves layer&#8208;controlled oxidation by developing large&#8208;scale UV&#8208;assisted intercalative oxidation, resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se heterostructures. The resulting &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor demonstrates remarkable self&#8208;rectifying resistive switching performance (over 105 for ON/OFF and rectification ratios, as well as nonlinearity) in both nanoscale (through conductive atomic force microscopy) and microscale (through memristor array) regimes. Furthermore, the potential for scalable production of self&#8208;rectifying &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5/Bi2O2Se memristor, achieving sub&#8208;pA sneak currents to minimize cross&#8208;talk effects in high&#8208;density memristor arrays is demonstrated. The memristors also exhibit ultrafast resistive switching (sub&#8208;100&#160;ns) and low power consumption (1.2 pJ) as characterized by pulse&#8208;mode testing. The findings suggest a synergetic effect of interfacial Schottky barriers and oxygen vacancy migration as the self&#8208;rectifying switching mechanism, elucidated through controllable &#946;&#8208;Bi2SeO5 thickness modulation and theoretical ab initio calculations.

Furthermore, the potential for scalable production of self-rectifying &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;/Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se memristor, achieving sub-pA sneak currents to minimize cross-talk effects in high-density memristor arrays is demonstrated. The memristors also exhibit ultrafast resistive switching (sub-100&#160;ns) and low power consumption (1.2 pJ) as characterized by pulse-mode testing. The findings suggest a synergetic effect of interfacial Schottky barriers and oxygen vacancy migration as the self-rectifying switching mechanism, elucidated through controllable &#946;-Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SeO&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; thickness modulation and theoretical ab initio calculations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Precisely Tunable Instantaneous Carbon Rearrangement Enables Low&#8208;Working&#8208;Potential Hard Carbon Toward Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries with Enhanced Energy Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable hard carbon (HC) with precisely tunable graphitic micro&#8208;domains and closed nanopores is achieved through a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically controlled synthesis. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the optimal sample exhibiting a plateau capacity of 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the assembled HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery is therefore increased by 20.7%.








Abstract
As the preferred anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, hard carbon (HC) confronts significant obstacles in providing a long and dominant low&#8208;voltage plateau to boost the output energy density of full batteries. The critical challenge lies in precisely enhancing the local graphitization degree to minimize Na+ ad&#8208;/chemisorption, while effectively controlling the growth of internal closed nanopores to maximize Na+ filling. Unfortunately, traditional high&#8208;temperature preparation methods struggle to achieve both objectives simultaneously. Herein, a transient sintering&#8208;involved kinetically&#8208;controlled synthesis strategy is proposed that enables the creation of metastable HCs with precisely tunable carbon phases and low discharge/charge voltage plateaus. By optimizing the temperature and width of thermal pulses, the high&#8208;throughput screened HCs are characterized by short&#8208;range ordered graphitic micro&#8208;domains that possess accurate crystallite width and height, as well as appropriately&#8208;sized closed nanopores. This advancement realizes HC anodes with significantly prolonged low&#8208;voltage plateaus below 0.1&#160;V, with the best sample exhibiting a high plateau capacity of up to 325&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The energy density of the HC||Na3V2(PO4)3 full battery can therefore be increased by 20.7%. Machine learning study explicitly unveils the &#8220;carbon phase evolution&#8722;electrochemistry&#8221; relationship. This work promises disruptive changes to the synthesis, optimization, and commercialization of HC anodes for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Machine Learning&#8208;Enabled Tomographic Imaging of Chemical Short&#8208;Range Atomic Ordering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning enhanced approach is introduced to break the inherent resolution limitation of atom probe tomography, and precisely image multiple arrangements of atoms associated with (non&#8208;) statistical chemical short&#8208;range order, in three dimensions, in CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloys with no prior knowledge of the presence of chemical short&#8208;range order or which type.








Abstract
In solids, chemical short&#8208;range order (CSRO) refers to the self&#8208;organization of atoms of certain species occupying specific crystal sites. CSRO is increasingly being envisaged as a lever to tailor the mechanical and functional properties of materials. Yet quantitative relationships between properties and the morphology, number density, and atomic configurations of CSRO domains remain elusive. Herein, it is showcased how machine learning&#8208;enhanced atom probe tomography (APT) can mine the near&#8208;atomically resolved APT data and jointly exploit the technique's high elemental sensitivity to provide a 3D quantitative analysis of CSRO in a CoCrNi medium&#8208;entropy alloy. Multiple CSRO configurations are revealed, with their formation supported by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Monte&#8208;Carlo simulations. Quantitative analysis of these CSROs allows establishing relationships between processing parameters and physical properties. The unambiguous characterization of CSRO will help refine strategies for designing advanced materials by manipulating atomic&#8208;scale architectures.

         <title>Solvation Regulation Reinforces Anion&#8208;Derived Inorganic&#8208;Rich Interphase for High&#8208;Performance Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Li Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The CIP solvated structure models with the faster kinetic process are established by introducing a multifunctional tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate initiator/additive in pDOL polymer system. A robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase is constructed for excellent reversibility of Li plating/stripping and superior quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state polymer lithium metal batteries are an important strategy for achieving high safety and high energy density. However, the issue of Li dendrites and inherent inferior interface greatly restricts practical application. Herein, this study introduces tris(2,2,2&#8208;trifluoroethyl)phosphate solvent with moderate solvation ability, which can not only complex with Li+ to promote the in&#8208;situ ring&#8208;opening polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL), but also build solvated structure models to explore the effect of different solvation structures in the polymer electrolyte. Thereinto, it is dominated by the contact ion pair solvated structure with pDOL chain segments forming less lithium bonds, exhibiting faster kinetic process and constructing a robust anion&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich interphase, which significantly improves the utilization rate of active Li and the high&#8208;voltage resistance of pDOL. As a result, it exhibits stable cycling at ultra&#8208;high areal capacity of 20 mAh cm&#8722;2 in half cells, and an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 2000&#160;h in symmetric cells can be realized. Furthermore, matched with LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 cathode, the capacity retention after 60 cycles is as high as 96.8% at N/P value of 3.33. Remarkably, 0.7 Ah Li||LiNi0.9Co0.05Mn0.05O2 pouch cell with an energy density of 461&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 can be stably cycled for five cycles at 100% depth of discharge.

         <title>Multidentate Fullerenes Enable Tunable and Robust Interfacial Bonding for Efficient Tin&#8208;Based Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structure&#8208;dependent effects of the four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerenes on the device performance of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Due to favorable energy level alignment and interface interactions, devices based on FM5 achieved a PCE of 15.05%, ranking among the top&#8208;performing tin&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Improving the efficiency of tin&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) is significantly hindered by energy level mismatch and weak interactions at the interface between the tin&#8208;based perovskite and fullerene&#8208;based electron transport layers (ETLs). In this study, four well&#8208;defined multidentate fullerene molecules with 3, 4, 5, and 6 diethylmalonate groups, labeled as FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6 are synthesized, and employed as interfacial layers in TPSCs. It is observed that increasing the number of functional groups in these fullerenes leads to shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and enhance interfacial chemical interactions. Notably, FM5 exhibits a suitable energy level and robust interaction with the perovskite, effectively enhancing electron extraction and defect passivation. Additionally, the unique molecular structure of FM5 allows the exposed carbon cage to be tightly stacked with the upper fullerene cage after interaction with the perovskite, facilitating efficient charge transfer and protecting the perovskite from moisture and oxygen damage. As a result, the FM5&#8208;based device achieves a champion efficiency of 15.05%, significantly surpassing that of the PCBM&#8208;based (11.77%), FM3&#8208;based (13.54%), FM4&#8208;based (14.34%), and FM6&#8208;based (13.75%) devices.

     alt="Multidentate Fullerenes Enable Tunable and Robust Interfacial Bonding for Efficient Tin-Based Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Structure-dependent effects of the four well-defined multidentate fullerenes on the device performance of tin-based perovskite solar cells are systemically investigated. Due to favorable energy level alignment and interface interactions, devices based on FM5 achieved a PCE of 15.05%, ranking among the top-performing tin-based devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Improving the efficiency of tin-based perovskite solar cells (TPSCs) is significantly hindered by energy level mismatch and weak interactions at the interface between the tin-based perovskite and fullerene-based electron transport layers (ETLs). In this study, four well-defined multidentate fullerene molecules with 3, 4, 5, and 6 diethylmalonate groups, labeled as FM3, FM4, FM5, and FM6 are synthesized, and employed as interfacial layers in TPSCs. It is observed that increasing the number of functional groups in these fullerenes leads to shallower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and enhance interfacial chemical interactions. Notably, FM5 exhibits a suitable energy level and robust interaction with the perovskite, effectively enhancing electron extraction and defect passivation. Additionally, the unique molecular structure of FM5 allows the exposed carbon cage to be tightly stacked with the upper fullerene cage after interaction with the perovskite, facilitating efficient charge transfer and protecting the perovskite from moisture and oxygen damage. As a result, the FM5-based device achieves a champion efficiency of 15.05%, significantly surpassing that of the PCBM-based (11.77%), FM3-based (13.54%), FM4-based (14.34%), and FM6-based (13.75%) devices. Moreover, the FM5-based unencapsulated device exhibits excellent stability, maintaining over 90% of its initial efficiency even after 300 h of air exposure.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Red Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes via Thermodynamic Crystallization Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional crystallization control strategy by ingenious vapor design is developed for preparing high&#8208;quality perovskite films. The target perovskite films exhibit efficient energy transfer and minimized charge loss. Consequently, a series of red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with record peak external quantum efficiency over 32%, along with remarkable half&#8208;lifetime are obtained.








Abstract
Efficient and stable red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) demonstrate promising potential in high&#8208;definition displays and biomedical applications. Although significant progress has been made in device performance, meeting commercial demands remains a challenge in the aspects of long&#8208;term stability and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). Here, an in situ crystallization regulation strategy is developed for optimizing red perovskite films through ingenious vapor design. Mixed vapor containing dimethyl sulfoxide and carbon disulfide (CS2) is incorporated to conventional annealing, which contributes to thermodynamics dominated perovskite crystallization for well&#8208;aligned cascade phase arrangement. Additionally, the perovskite surface defect density is minimized by the CS2 molecule adsorption. Consequently, the target perovskite films exhibit smooth exciton energy transfer, reduced defect density, and blocked ion migration pathways. Leveraging these advantages, spectrally stable red PeLEDs are obtained featuring emission at 668, 656, and 648&#160;nm, which yield record peak EQEs of 30.08%, 32.14%, and 29.04%, along with prolonged half&#8208;lifetimes of 47.7, 60.0, and 43.7&#160;h at the initial luminances of 140, 250, and 270&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides a universal strategy for optimizing perovskite crystallization and represents a significant stride toward the commercialization of red PeLEDs.

         <title>Robust Imidazole&#8208;Linked Covalent Organic Framework Enabling Crystallization Regulation and Bulk Defect Passivation for Highly Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
1D porous channels and high crystalline orientation of imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) facilitate the crystallization and defect elimination of the perovskite film. The recombination of photogenerated carriers is thus reduced and the perovskite solar cells exhibit excellent efficiency and high stability.








Abstract
The low crystallinity of the perovskite layers and many defects at grain boundaries within the bulk phase and at interfaces are considered huge barriers to the attainment of high performance and stability in perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a robust photoelectric imidazole&#8208;linked porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic framework (PyPor&#8208;COF) is introduced to precisely control the perovskite crystallization process and effectively passivate defects at grain boundaries through a sequential deposition method. The 1D porous channels, abundant active sites, and high crystallization orientation of PyPor&#8208;COF offer advantages for regulating the crystallization of PbI2 and eliminating defects. Moreover, the intrinsic electronic characteristics of PyPor&#8208;COF endow a more closely matched energy level arrangement within the perovskite layer, which promotes charge transport and thereby suppresses the recombination of photogenerated carriers. The champion PSCs containing PyPor&#8208;COF achieved power conversion efficiencies of 24.10% (0.09 cm2) and 20.81% (1.0 cm2), respectively. The unpackaged optimized device is able to maintain its initial efficiency of 80.39% even after being exposed to air for 2000 h. The device also exhibits excellent heating stability and light stability. This work gives a new impetus to the development of highly efficient and stable PSCs via employing COFs.

         <title>Mussel&#8208;Inspired, Self&#8208;Healing, Highly Effective Fully Polymeric Fire&#8208;Retardant Coatings Enabled by Group Synergy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the multifunctions of mussel's catechol groups, here a pioneering &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy has been proposed to create a waterborne fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating that exhibits self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and superior fire protection for various substrates from polymer foams to steel structures. These results offer a promising design principle for creating high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings.









Abstract
Fire&#8208;retardant coatings represent a universal cost&#8208;effective approach to providing fire protection for various substrates without compromising substrates&#8217; bulk properties. However, it has been attractive yet highly challenging to create waterborne polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coatings combining high&#8208;efficiency, generally strong adhesion, and self&#8208;repairability due to a lack of rational design principles. Inspired by mussel's unique adhesive, self&#8208;healing, and char&#8208;forming mechanisms, herein, a &#8220;group synergy&#8221; design strategy is proposed to realize the combination of self&#8208;healing, strong adhesion, and high efficiency in a fully polymeric fire&#8208;retardant coating via multiple synergies between catechol, phosphonic, and hydroxyethyl groups. As&#8208;created fire&#8208;retardant coating exhibits a rapid room&#8208;temperature self&#8208;healing ability and strong adhesion to (non)polar substrates due to multiple dynamic non&#8208;covalent interactions enabled by these groups. Because these functional groups enable the formation of a robust structurally intact yet slightly expanded char layer upon exposure to flame, a 200&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick such coating can make extremely flammable polystyrene foam very difficult to ignite and self&#8208;extinguishing, which far outperforms previous strategies. Moreover, this coating can provide universal exceptional fire protection for a variety of substrates from polymer foams, and timber, to fabric and steel. This work presents a promising material design principle to create next&#8208;generation sustainable high&#8208;performance fire&#8208;retardant coatings for general fire protection.

Engineered Regenerative Isolated Peripheral Nerve Interface
An engineered regenerative isolated peripheral nerve interface (eRIPEN) is developed using 3D bioprinting of myoblasts and skeletal muscle&#8208;derived decellularized extracellular matrix bioink, along with direct electrospinning to create a nanofiber membrane&#8208;envelope for in vivo host nerve implantation. More details can be found in article number 2406652 by Dong&#8208;Woo Cho, Dong Sung Kim, Junesun Kim, and co&#8208;workers.

3D&#8208;Printed Latticed Microneedles
3D&#8208;printed latticed microneedle array patches (L&#8208;MAPs) are a modular platform for minimally invasive drug delivery into the skin. L&#8208;MAPs can deliver diverse payloads, with multiple cargo release profiles on a single patch. Release kinetics can be tuned as a function of needle geometry and cargo formulation. This platform opens up opportunities to scale up transdermal drug delivery. More details can be found in article number 2404606 by Netra Rajesh, Jillian Perry, Joseph DeSimone, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Quantitative in Vivo Molecular MRI</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantitative molecular MRI is essential in preclinical research and drug development. This review aims to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of new tools for non&#8208;invasive quantitative imaging of biological processes.








Abstract
Molecular magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) combines chemistry, chemical biology, and imaging techniques to track molecular events non&#8208;invasively. Quantitative molecular MRI aims to provide meaningful, reproducible numerical measurements of molecular processes or biochemical targets within the body. In this review, the classifications of molecular MRI probes based on their signal&#8208;generating mechanism and functionality are first described. From there, the primary considerations for in vitro characterization and in vivo validation of molecular MRI probes, including how to avoid pitfalls and biases are discussed. Then, recommendations on imaging acquisition protocols and analysis methods to establish quantitative relationships between MRI signal change induced by the probes and the molecular processes of interest are provided. Finally, several representative case studies are highlighted that incorporate these features. Quantitative molecular MRI is a multidisciplinary research area incorporating expertise in chemical biology, inorganic chemistry, molecular probes, imaging physics, drug development, pathobiology, and medicine. The purpose of this review is to provide guidance to chemists developing MR imaging probes and methods in terms of in vitro and in vivo validation to accelerate the translation of these new quantitative tools for non&#8208;invasive imaging of biological processes.

         <title>Affinity&#8208;Controlled Partitioning of Biomolecules at Aqueous Interfaces and Their Bioanalytic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 36, Issue 44, November 1, 2024. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this paper, an in&#8208;depth exploration of all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and their potential applications in bioanalytics is provided. The key concepts, such as affinity&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena,&#160; and associated applications including interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and biosensing, are comprehensively discussed. Challenges, particularly in stabilizing all&#8208;aqueous interfaces and handling low&#8208;volume samples, as well as future directions, including optimizing material compositions and refining protocols to advance the field, are also presented.








Abstract
All&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems play essential roles in bioanalytical and biochemical applications. Compared to conventional oil and organic solvent&#8208;based systems, these systems are characterized by their rich bulk and interfacial properties, offering superior biocompatibility. In particular, phase separation in all&#8208;aqueous systems facilitates the creation of compartments with specific physicochemical properties, and therefore largely enhances the accessibility of the systems. In addition, the all&#8208;aqueous compartments have diverse affinities, with an important property known as partitioning, which can concentrate (bio)molecules toward distinct immiscible phases. This partitioning affinity imparts all&#8208;aqueous interfaces with selective permeability, enabling the controlled enrichment of target (bio)molecules. This review introduces the basic principles and applications of partitioning&#8208;induced interfacial phenomena in a typical all&#8208;aqueous system, namely aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPSs); these applications include interfacial chemical reactions, bioprinting, and assembly, as well as bio&#8208;sensing and detection. The primary challenges associated with designing all&#8208;aqueous phase separation systems and several future directions are also discussed, such as the stabilization of aqueous interfaces, the handling of low&#8208;volume samples, and exploration of suitable ATPSs compositions with the efficient protocol.

         <title>Surface Defects Control Bulk Carrier Densities in Polycrystalline Pb&#8208;Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Doping, the controlled addition of imperfections or impurities to a material, is crucial for semiconductors. This study shows that for&#160;Halide Perovskites, which have (very) low (intrinsic) defect densities because of&#160;effective self&#8208;healing and defect tolerance,&#160;the title's statement holds in an unprecedented fashion.








Abstract
The (opto)electronic behavior of semiconductors depends on their (quasi&#8208;)free electronic carrier densities. These are regulated by semiconductor doping, i.e., controlled &#8220;electronic contamination&#8221;. For metal halide perovskites (HaPs), the functional materials in several device types, which already challenge some of the understanding of semiconductor properties, this study shows that doping type, density and properties derived from these, are to a first approximation controlled via their surfaces. This effect, relevant to all semiconductors, and already found for some, is very evident for lead (Pb)&#8208;HaPs because of their intrinsically low electrically active bulk and surface defect densities. Volume carrier densities for most polycrystalline Pb&#8208;HaP films (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m grain diameter) are below those resulting from even &lt; 0.1% of surface sites being electrically active defects. This implies and is consistent with interfacial defects controlling HaP devices in multi&#8208;layered structures with most of the action at the two HaP interfaces. Surface and interface passivation effects on bulk electrical properties are relevant to all semiconductors and are crucial for developing those used today. However, because bulk dopant introduction in HaPs at controlled ppm levels for electronic&#8208;relevant carrier densities is so difficult, passivation effects are vastly more critical and dominate, to first approximation, their optoelectronic characteristics in devices.

A novel chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition method is presented for the precise fabrication of chiral nematic graphene film, which exhibits uniform Na plating without dendrite formation and noteworthy thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding performance. This work paves the way for creating a large family of chiral nematic materials in various applications of photoelectric conversion, energy storage, electromagnetism, and separation.








Abstract
Ordering a crucial material like pure&#8208;graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long&#8208;range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral&#8208;template&#8208;directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left&#8208;hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&#8722;1), high specific surface area (1508 m2&#160;g&#8722;1) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties. The films also achieved impressive thickness&#8208;dependent electromagnetic shielding, i.e., 35&#8211;63&#160;dB, demonstrating their potentially multi&#8208;disciplinary applications.

&lt;p&gt;Ordering a crucial material like pure-graphene into the chiral nematic structure can potentially revolutionize the fields of photonics, chiral separation, and energy storage. However, the controlled fabrication of highly ordered graphene films with a long-range chiral nematic mesoporous structure is very challenging and as such, has not been achieved. Here, a chiral-template-directed chemical vapor deposition growth strategy is presented for the precise fabrication of mesoporous chiral nematic graphene films by using nanocrystalline cellulose as templates. It is evidenced that such graphene films possess the left-hand helical ordering, chiral nematic mesoporous structure with adjustable pore sizes (6.4&#8211;13.1&#160;nm), tailored pitch, excellent electrical conductivity (556 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high specific surface area (1508 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and mechanical flexibility. By coating Na anode with this film, uniform Na plating is achieved with no dendrite formation, resulting from its unique chiral nematic structure and tunable physicochemical properties.
