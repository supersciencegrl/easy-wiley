         <title>Spin&#8208;Mixing Enhanced Proximity Effect in Aluminum&#8208;Based Superconductor&#8208;Semiconductor Hybrids</title>

Abstract
In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the development of topological qubits. In this application, however, aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, we&#160;resolve this limitation by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g. platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, we&#160;show that the increased field resilience originates from spin&#8208;orbit scattering introduced by Pt. we&#160;exploit this property in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor&#8208;superconductor hybrids, where we&#160;show that InSb nanowires strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7&#160;T. The two&#8208;electron charging effect, a fundamental requirement for topological quantum computation, is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms. Additionally, we&#160;use non&#8208;local spectroscopy in a three&#8208;terminal geometry to probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub&#8208;gap states. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that semiconductor states which are proximitized by Al/Pt films maintain their ability to Zeeman&#8208;split in an applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well&#8208;known fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to Al&#8208;based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors, whenever high&#8208;field resilience is&#160;required.

         <title>Roles of MXene in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D layered nanosheet MXene has been widely studied in pressure sensing due to the excellent mechanical and electrical properties, outstanding hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. To further promote the application of MXene in pressure sensors, the preparation of MXene, MXene&#8208;based microstructures, MXene pressure&#8208;sensor mechanisms, and the integration of multiple devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red&#8208;hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand&#8208;new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e&#8208;skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene&#8208;based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e&#8208;skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

         <title>Snakeskin&#8208;inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armors or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, here we&#160;propose a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor), which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of Kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, we show the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN &#8764; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27 K &#8211; 3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;cycling Lithium Metal Battery Enabled by Ultrathin, 2D shield&#8208;defensive, and Single lithium&#8208;ion Conducting Polymeric Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polymeric membranes are considered as promising materials to realize safe and long&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, they are usually based on soft one&#8208;dimensional (1D) linear polymers and thus cannot effectively inhibit piercing of lithium dendrites at high current density. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate single lithium&#8208;ion conducting molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) with a new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &#8220;soft&#8208;hard&#8208;soft&#8221; hierarchical structure by grafting hairy lithium polystyrenesulfonate (PSSLi) chains on both sides of graphene oxide (GO) sheets. We further construct ultrathin GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane by evaporation&#8208;induced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly of GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi molecular brushes. Unlike conventional soft 1D linear polymeric structure, the rigid 2D extended aromatic structure of intralayer GO backbones can bear the shield effect of preventing the dendrites possibly generated at high current density from piercing. More importantly, such a shield effect could be significantly strengthened by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected interlayer channels and the soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi side&#8208;chains on the surface of channels provide rapid lithium&#8208;ion transportation pathways and homogenize lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. As a result, LMBs with GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane possess long&#8208;term reversible lithium plating/striping (6 months) at high current density.

We further construct ultrathin GO-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSSLi membrane by evaporation-induced layer-by-layer self-assembly of GO-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSSLi molecular brushes. Unlike conventional soft 1D linear polymeric structure, the rigid 2D extended aromatic structure of intralayer GO backbones can bear the shield effect of preventing the dendrites possibly generated at high current density from piercing. More importantly, such a shield effect could be significantly strengthened by layer-by-layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected interlayer channels and the soft single lithium-ion conducting PSSLi side-chains on the surface of channels provide rapid lithium-ion transportation pathways and homogenize lithium-ion fluxes. As a result, LMBs with GO-&lt;i&gt;g&lt;/i&gt;-PSSLi membrane possess long-term reversible lithium plating/striping (6 months) at high current density.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultra&#8208;stable Silicon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, we build a layered conductive polyaniline (named as LCP) coating on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in&#8208;situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8764; 3 mAh cm&#8211;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5 A g&#8211;1. This work demonstrates great potential of regulating the SEI properties by layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices Utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its three&#8208;dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;luminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, we designed a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (PNCs) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs). We observed a dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs. The majority of this increase is driven by efficient inherent emission of 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best performing LECs reported to date.

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of fundamental mechanism understanding, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCN) were designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and an eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) was selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogeneous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8208;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity. This performance outperforms equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; was detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation was proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>How to Change the Reaction Chemistry on Non&#8208;Precious Metal Oxide Nanostructure Materials for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Glycerol to Renewable Chemicals?</title>

Abstract
Au and Pt are well&#8208;known catalysts for electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol. Although some non&#8208;precious metal based materials to replace the costly Au and Pt have been used for this reaction, the fundamental question of how the non&#8208;precious catalysts affect the reaction chemistry and mechanism compared to Au and Pt catalysts is still unanswered. In this work, both experimental and computational methods are used to understand how and why the reaction performance and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR) change with electrochemically&#8208;synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts. The Au and Pt catalysts generated major glyceric acid and glycolic acid products from the EGOR. Interestingly, the prepared Cu based oxides produced glycolic acid and formic acid with high selectivity of about 90.0%. This different reaction chemistry was related to the enhanced ability of C&#8208;C bond cleavage on the Cu based oxide materials. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the formic acids were mainly formed on the Cu based oxide surfaces rather than in the process of glycolic acid formation in the free energy diagram. This study provides critical scientific insights into developing future non&#8208;precious&#8208;based materials for electrochemical biomass conversions.

Interestingly, the prepared Cu based oxides produced glycolic acid and formic acid with high selectivity of about 90.0%. This different reaction chemistry was related to the enhanced ability of C-C bond cleavage on the Cu based oxide materials. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the formic acids were mainly formed on the Cu based oxide surfaces rather than in the process of glycolic acid formation in the free energy diagram. This study provides critical scientific insights into developing future non-precious-based materials for electrochemical biomass conversions.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/Nanoprocessing in Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development trends, and advantages and deficiencies of three processing methods: micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining (microcutting, micro/nanowelding, and LIGA) are systematically summarized, adding to the existing body of knowledge for employing appropriate polymer processing techniques in customized industrial applications.








Abstract
Polymers are widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy&#8208;harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nanoprocessing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high&#8208;resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high&#8208;resolution micro/nanostructures is explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small&#8208;batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nanoprocessing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and future trends for micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining are discussed. Moreover, an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer&#8208;based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors is provided. These techniques are expected to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next&#8208;generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart, and biodegradable devices.

         <title>Ultrahigh Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Materials from Spinodal Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications. Despite continuing efforts toward reducing material dimensions to increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, achieving further improvements without compromising material quality has become a fundamental challenge. To this end, we&#160;propose a method to drastically increase the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition while maintaining a low microwave loss. we&#160;used epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N as a model system and for the first time demonstrated the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material disorder. The measured kinetic inductance increased by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude compared with the best disordered superconducting nitrides reported to date. Our&#160;work paves the way for substantially enhancing and deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting quantum&#160;circuits.

         <title>Twisting Linear to Orbital Angular Momentum in an Ultrasonic Motor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact ultrasonic motor built with a meta engine block that enables high&#8208;efficiency momentum twisting and contactless rotation of sound&#8208;absorbing objects is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Without dependence on multiple sources or geometric symmetry, this passive device deeply simplifies the orbital angular momentum production in 2D acoustic systems and offers new possibilities for the miniaturization and integration of vortex devices.








Abstract
An ultrasonic motor built with a contactless meta engine block (MEB) is designed and experimentally demonstrated for twisting the linear momentum of sound emanating from a Helmholtz resonator&#8208;based metasurface into orbital angular momentum (OAM). The MEB is capable of hosting highly efficient excitations of eigenmodes carrying desired OAM whose Bessel acoustic intensity patterns are enhanced by over ten times compared to the incident wave. Thanks to this efficiency, bidirectional ultrasonic OAM is capable of driving loads at speeds up to 1000&#160;rpm at 4 W and remarkable sound radiation torque levels. Moreover, the possibility of using arbitrarily shaped MEBs is also demonstrated by engineering its physical boundary condition based on an analytically derived criterion to guarantee the high twisting efficiency of man&#8208;made OAM. The results show how noninvasive driving of an ultrasonic motor can be made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

         <title>Untangling the Mechanisms of Lattice Distortions in Biogenic Crystals across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy (DFXM) method is used to provide unprecedented information on large biogenic crystals across scales. Detailed analysis in 3D establishes correlations between local nanoscale lattice distortions, chemical composition, and the formation process of the biogenic crystal as a whole. Most importantly, it allows a number of mechanisms that drive the process of biomineral formation to be untangled.








Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth, and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional, and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex 3D architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this has only been possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study, the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy method is employed to study the link between 3D crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. Mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition, and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit are unraveled.

         <title>Spatial Distribution Control of Antimicrobial Peptides through a Novel Polymeric Carrier for Safe and Efficient Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric antimicrobial peptides (AMP) carrier that can enhance anticancer efficacy and minimize the potential side effects of AMPs by finely controlling their spatial distribution is reported. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability.








Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential for use in tumor treatment. However, developing AMP&#8208;based antitumor therapies is challenging due to circulatory instability, hemolytic toxicity, low selectivity, and poor cell permeability of AMPs. In this study, a polymeric carrier for AMPs (denoted as PAMPm&#8208;co&#8208;PPBEn/PCA) is presented that effectively enhances their anticancer efficacy while minimizing their potential side effects. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability. Upon employing KLA as the model AMP, the polymeric carrier's hemolytic toxicity during blood circulation is suppressed, its cellular internalization when reaching tumor tissues facilitated, and its membranolytic toxicity toward the mitochondria upon entering cancer cells restored and further enhanced. Animal studies indicate that this approach significantly improves the antitumor efficacy of KLA and reduces its toxicity. Considering that the loading method for most AMPs is identical to that of KLA, the polymeric carrier reported in this study may provide a feasible approach for the development of AMP&#8208;based cancer treatments.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics with Optimized Light Utilization for Printable Solar Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction strategy is an efficient strategy to improving average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) simultaneously due to the reduction of the optical loss, and the semitransparent devices afford a highest efficiency of 14.62% with a considerable AVT of 20.42%.








Abstract
The existing conformation of the active layer is defective for employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, scalable solar windows are successfully printed by introducing a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. The universality of the PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST&#8208;OSCs is proved. Furthermore, an inset of a superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8243;,3&#8243;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance. Moreover, the PCE of the unilateral broken solar windows retains 70.6% of the initial efficiency after being placed under simulated rainfall conditions for 1200 h at room temperature.

         <title>An On&#8208;Chip Liquid Metal Plug Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator is demonstrated. Reproducible liquid metal plugs of a given size are generated based on Laplace pressure tuning in constricted channels whereas plugs of varying sizes and interspacing are generated for modulated voltages in straight channels prefilled with 1 m NaOH. This device can be used to generate liquid metal plugs on demand directly on&#8208;chip.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nonspherical droplets (plugs) have seen increasing demand recently mainly because their high aspect ratios make them beneficial for a wide range of applications, including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, sensor technology, radio&#8208;frequency devices, actuators, and switches. However, reproducibility of the generation of such plugs, as well as precise control over their size, is yet challenging. In this work, a simple on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator using a commercially available 3D microprinter is presented and the plug generator in poly(dimethylsiloxane) is replicated via soft lithography. Liquid metal plugs are generated via a combination of electrochemical oxidation, design of well&#8208;defined constrictions based on Laplace pressure, and the application of modulated voltage control signals. It is shown that plugs of various aspect ratios can be generated reproducibly for channel widths of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.5&#160;mm with constriction widths of 0.1&#160;mm at 6&#160;V. Laplace&#8208;pressure&#8208;controlled plugs in constricted channels are compared to modulated&#8208;voltage&#8208;generated plugs in straight channels showing that this technique provides significantly enhanced reproducibility and control over the size and spacing between the plugs. This work paves the way to sub&#8208;millimeter liquid metal plugs generated directly on&#8208;chip for on&#8208;demand MEMS and microfluidic applications.

         <title>Automated Laser&#8208;Transfer Synthesis of High&#8208;Density Microarrays for Infectious Disease Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated laser&#8208;based synthesis machine is presented, combining laser&#8208;induced forward transfer and robotics to perform parallel chemistry in the microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. By developing an optimization pipeline, peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences can be synthesized in high yield to study the antibody responses in infectious disease patients.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limits LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, an automated synthesis instrument is reported that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

         <title>Crowning Lithium Ions in Hole&#8208;Transport Layer toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address the negative impacts of doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity and ion diffusion. Crowning Li+ ions in the hole&#8208;transporting layer enables perovskite solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency and significantly improves stability under humid and thermal conditions.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to that of silicon photovoltaic devices. However, the device stability remains a major obstacle that restricts widespread application. Doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity, ion diffusion, and use of polar solvents in the hole&#8208;transport layer are detrimental factors for performance degradation of PSCs. Here, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address these negative impacts. 12&#8208;Crown&#8208;4&#160;as an efficient phase&#8208;transfer catalyst promotes the dissolution of LiTFSI without requiring acetonitrile. A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates the host&#8211;guest interaction between Li+ ions and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Crowning Li+ ions by forming more stable and less diffusive crown&#8208;ether&#8211;Li+ complexes retards the generation of hygroscopic lithium oxides and mitigates Li+&#8208;ion migration. Optimized PSCs deliver enhanced PCE and significantly improved stability under humid and thermal conditions compared with a control device. This method can also be applied to dope &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The findings provide a facile avenue to improve the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Integrated Soft Thermoelectrics for Shape Memory Actuation and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) thermoelectric device is reported, which combining active Peltier heating and cooling of LCE, along with environmental and regenerative Seebeck energy harvesting in a 3D printed material architecture. A new method of actuating LCEs, along with a new, more efficient approach to soft robotics, is introduced.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have attracted tremendous interest as actuators for soft robotics due to their mechanical and shape memory properties. However, LCE actuators typically respond to thermal stimulation through active Joule heating and passive cooling, which make them difficult to control. In this work, LCEs are combined with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heats and cools to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage&#8208;controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed&#8208;loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking toward a heat source and harvesting energy is introduced. Lastly, phototropic&#8208;inspired autonomous deflection of the limbs toward a heat source is shown, demonstrating an additional method to increase energy recuperation efficiency for soft systems.

         <title>Giant Spin Hall Effect and Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques in 5d Transition Metal&#8211;Aluminum Alloys from Extrinsic Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral domain walls are moved with current pulses highly efficiently along synthetic antiferromagnetic racetracks formed on thin underlayers of several 5d&#8208;Al alloys. These alloys exhibit very large spin Hall angles of up to &#8776;1.0 and, moreover, template [001] oriented Co&#8211;Ni multilayers with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, making them highly useful for racetrack memories compatible with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
The generation of spin currents from charge currents via the spin Hall effect (SHE) is of fundamental and technological interest. Here, some of the largest SHEs yet observed via extrinsic scattering are found in a large class of binary compounds formed from a 5d element and aluminum, with a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) of &#8776;1 in the compound Os22Al78. A critical composition of the 5d element is found at which there is a structural phase boundary between poorly and highly textured crystalline material, where the SHA exhibits its largest value. Furthermore, a systematic increase is found in the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and SHA at this critical composition as the atomic number of the 5d element is systematically increased. This clearly shows that the SHE and SHC are derived from extrinsic scattering mechanisms related to the potential mismatch between the 5d element and Al. These studies show the importance of extrinsic mechanisms derived from potential mismatch as a route to obtaining large spin Hall angles with high technological impact. Indeed, it is demonstrated that a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art racetrack device has a several&#8208;fold increased current&#8208;induced domain wall efficiency using these materials as compared to prior&#8208;art materials.

         <title>A Universal Strategy of Intermolecular Exchange to Stabilize &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 and Manage Crystal Orientation for High&#8208;Performance Humid&#8208;Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine is introduced via antisolvent engineering into a formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite film, which promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis and superior stability.








Abstract
Preparation of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine (nHA) is introduced via antisolvent engineering into an FA&#8208;based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. Moreover, the existence of nHA in the final perovskite film also reduces the defects and suppresses ion migration. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis, and the fabricated devices exhibit superior reproductivity. The device stability is also enhanced, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1500 h in ambient air. Moreover, the PCE has no attenuation at the maximum power point under continuous 1&#8208;sun light soaking for 500 h. The universality of this method is also demonstrated by other perovskite compositions, including methylamine lead iodine (MAPbI3) and FAxMA1&#8722;xPbI3 in humid air.

An acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte is prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, ranking top among the solid proton conductors in terms of high proton conductivities, enlarged electrochemical stability window, and reduced chemical reactivity. Benefitting from the above advantages, the acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte can solve two main challenges in proton batteries: gassing and poor cycling performance.








Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. A family of new proton electrolytes is reported: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of micrometers) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8211;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#160;&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical reactivity. A proton battery is assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries are successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <dc:description>
The transient absorption in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides grown on fused silica by the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis technique exhibits very unusual decay dynamics that feature long&#8208;lived components progressively increasing with the excitation fluence. The experimental observations are interpreted as resulting from the strain&#8208;induced modification of the electronic bands and concomitant interplay of the intervalley and intravalley excitons&#8217; populations.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method is performed. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable redshifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of picoseconds to few nanoseconds) with an increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. The observations are related to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;Active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymer with stretchability up to 200% strain and 5000 repeated cycles is reported. The strain&#8208;induced electrical performance and structural evolution are systematically studied. An intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated to give the a normalized Gm of 233 S cm&#8722;1 and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Real&#8208;time on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram signal recording is realized.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to the uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, but they have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, a stretchable semiconductor is reported for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with OECT performance on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Validated by systematic characterizations and comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are a nonlinear backbone architecture, a moderate side&#8208;chain density, and a sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, an intrinsically stretchable OECT is fabricated with high normalized transconductance (&#8776;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording is demonstrated, which combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

         <title>Adaptive Self&#8208;Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1&#8208;decanethiol, the nanomaterials self&#8208;organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain&#8208;insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.








Abstract
Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here, a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block&#8208;copolymer matrix is presented. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&lt;50% strain). It is demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self&#8208;organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strain when their surface is conjugated with 1&#8208;decanethiol. Distinct self&#8208;organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions are found. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials can render the resistance of the nanocomposites insensitive to uniaxial or biaxial strains. As a result, the resistance can be maintained with a variance of &lt;&#160;1% during 1000 stretching cycles under uniaxial and biaxial strains of &lt;50% while a high conductivity of &#8776;31&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1 is achieved.

         <title>A Better Choice to Achieve High Volumetric Energy Density: Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of Li metal is low, so the abuse of Li foil in Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) can easily lead to the loss of their advantage in volumetric energy density over Li&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, Li plating on a Li substrate is not as dense as that on a Cu substrate. Therefore, anode&#8208;free LMBs are more worthy of recommendation.








Abstract
Volumetric energy density is a critical but easily neglected index of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Compared with gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density (VED) of LMBs is much more sensitive to the anode/cathode (A/C) ratio due to the low density of lithium (Li) metal and the volume expansion of the Li&#8208;metal anode owing to its pulverization during cycles. Anode&#8208;free LMBs (AF&#8208;LMBs) have high theoretical VED due to the absence of an anode and high retention with relatively low cell expansion. Because Li plating highly depends on the mother substrate, Li plating on copper (Cu) substrates is more reversible and denser than that on Li substrates during cycling, which is beneficial for maintaining high volumetric capacity and efficient Li utilization. Therefore, considering that excess Li must be strictly limited to achieve competitive energy density, AF&#8208;LMBs (with bare Cu foil as the anode current collector) for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;density batteries are recommended.

         <title>Facile, Energy&#8208;Efficient Microscale Fibrillation of Polyacrylamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into fiber formation can provide rationale for the design of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. An energy&#8208;efficient route to formation of fibers with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is reported. This strategy offers a molecular&#8208;level understanding of fiber formation under ambient conditions which reduces current required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Insight into fiber formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibers have shown impressive tensile properties, the fiber formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. Controlled fiber formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is demonstrated. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures yield a simple and energy&#8208;efficient route to fiber formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fiber forming conditions of polymeric solutions is achieved. Ethanol is utilized as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight of the polyacrylamides, and the entanglement regimes of the solutions are determined through rheological characterization showing fiber formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibers, it is shown that fibers with good mechanical properties can be obtained without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fiber formation under ambient conditions with molecular&#8208;level understanding of their&#160;assembly.

&lt;p&gt;Insight into fiber formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibers have shown impressive tensile properties, the fiber formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. Controlled fiber formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is demonstrated. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures yield a simple and energy-efficient route to fiber formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two-to-three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fiber forming conditions of polymeric solutions is achieved. Ethanol is utilized as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight of the polyacrylamides, and the entanglement regimes of the solutions are determined through rheological characterization showing fiber formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibers, it is shown that fibers with good mechanical properties can be obtained without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fiber formation under ambient conditions with molecular-level understanding of their&#160;assembly.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spanning Network Gels from Nanoparticles and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Their Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels of lead telluride nanoparticles are structurally characterized using graph theory. The morphology of the gels is quantified, identifying the effect of various salt concentrations and compositions on the connectivity of the network structures. Significant influence by divalent cations on gel structure is observed. Relationships between the structural descriptors and viscoelastic and charge transport properties are evaluated.








Abstract
Gels self&#8208;assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size&#8208;dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non&#8208;crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non&#8208;crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte by engineering of the molecular channels in lithiated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is presented. In situ electrolyte mediation in the COF increases charge&#8208;carrier concentration, eliminates interfacial defects, and activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner. The COF&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates reliable electrochemical cyclability in pouch cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+&#8208;conductive covalent organic framework (COF) is presented, which represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered microenvironment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

         <title>Quantum Sensing and Imaging of Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque&#8208;Driven Spin Dynamics in the Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet Mn3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum imaging of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films is achieved using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also established, highlighting the significant potential of NV centers in diagnosing the local magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials with vanishingly small magnetic moments.








Abstract
Novel non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, non&#8208;trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Cascade Downregulation of the HER Family by a Dual&#8208;Targeted Recombinant Protein&#8211;Drug Conjugate to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#160;and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#160;dual&#8208;targeted recombinant protein drug conjugate can downregulate the expressions of the HER family including EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4, inhibit the downstream signaling pathways, and improve the drug accumulation and distribution in tumors, leading to reduction of tumor size and significant inhibition of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2&#160;positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in the clinic due to tumor resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here, the development of a recombinant protein (RP&#8208;HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC&#8208;HI) to target both HER2&#160;and integrin is reported. When simultaneously blocking HER2&#160;and integrin by RP&#8208;HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of HER family members, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC&#8208;HI significantly improves the tumor inhibition efficacy to 97.5% in treating HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer, comparing to 34.3% for free DOX. RPDC&#8208;HI shows even better antitumor efficiency than a monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, when treating larger tumors. The developed dual&#8208;targeted RPDC platform offers a new and promising strategy for treating HER2&#8208;positive patients with synergistic therapeutic effects against tumor resistance to the conventional HER2&#8208;targeted treatment.

The rational design of a donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimer emitter that shows remarkable photophysical properties, including efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and high photoluminescence quantum yield, is reported. Its use is demonstrated in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge. An effective solution, highlighted in this work, is to use highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimers as emitters. Here, the design, synthesis, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, and photophysics of three triazine&#8208;based dendrimers, tBuCz2pTRZ, tBuCz2mTRZ, and tBuCz2m2pTRZ, is reported, which resolve the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small &#916;EST and a large oscillator strength by incorporating both meta&#8208; and para&#8208;connected donor dendrons about a central triazine acceptor. The solution&#8208;processed OLED containing a host&#8208;free emitting layer exhibits an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.7%, a current efficiency of 98.8&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 91.3&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The device emits with an electroluminescence maximum, &#955;EL, of 540&#160;nm and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.37, 0.57). This represents the most efficient host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED reported to date. Further optimization directed at improving the charge balance within the device results in an emissive layer containing 30 wt% OXD&#8208;7, which leads to an OLED with the similar EQEmax of 28.4% but showing a significantly improved efficiency rolloff where the EQE remains high at 22.7% at a luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>A Robust Memristor Based on Epitaxial Vertically Aligned Nanostructured BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 Films on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite films system consisting of ferroelectric material and dielectric film is proposed as a memristor medium to improve the comprehensive performances of the resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and epitaxial BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 ferroelectric films on silicon are obtained successfully. The durability of the device is more than 109 cycles, and the speed can be lower than 10 ns.








Abstract
With the exploration of ferroelectric materials, researchers have a strong desire to explore the next generation of non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memory with silicon&#8208;based epitaxy, high&#8208;density storage, and algebraic operations. Herein, a silicon&#8208;based memristor with an epitaxial vertically aligned nanostructures BaTiO3&#8211;CeO2 film based on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/SrTiO3/Si substrate is reported. The ferroelectric polarization reversal is optimized through the continuous exploring of growth temperature, and the epitaxial structure is obtained, thus it improves the resistance characteristic, the multi&#8208;value storage function of five states is achieved, and the robust endurance characteristic can reach 109 cycles. In the synapse plasticity modulated by pulse voltage process, the function of the spiking&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity and paired&#8208;pulse facilitation is simulated successfully. More importantly, the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are realized by using fast speed pulse of the width &#8776;50&#160;ns. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network is constructed for identifying the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset, to simulate the performance of the device; the online and offline learning recognition rate reach 90.03% and 92.55%, respectively. Overall, this study paves the way for memristors with silicon&#8208;based epitaxial ferroelectric films to realize multi&#8208;value storage, algebraic operations, and neural computing chip applications.

         <title>2D MBenes: A Novel Member in the Flatland</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, have recently gained tremendous attention due to their unique properties. This Perspective sheds light on the material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship of MBenes and elucidates the most prospective applications in various fields, thus opening a promising paradigm for designing new functional systems and high&#8208;performance devices with multipurpose functionalities.








Abstract
2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, are a very recent derivative of ternary or quaternary transition metal boride (MAB) phases and represent a new member in the flatland. Although holding great potential toward various applications, mainly theoretical knowledge about their potential properties is available. Theoretical calculations and preliminary experimental attempts demonstrate their rich chemistry, excellent reactivity, mechanical strength/stability, electrical conductivity, transition properties, and energy harvesting possibility. Compared to MXenes, MBenes&#8217; structure appears to be more complex due to multiple crystallographic arrangements, polymorphism, and structural transformations. This makes their synthesis and subsequent delamination into single flakes challenging. Overcoming this bottleneck will enable a rational control over MBenes&#8217; material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship. Innovations in MBenes&#8217; postprocessing approaches will allow for the design of new functional systems and devices with multipurpose functionalities thus opening a promising paradigm for the conscious design of high&#8208;performance 2D materials.

         <title>Porous Polymers as Universal Reversal Agents for Heparin Anticoagulants through an Inclusion&#8211;Sequestration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy is developed by making use of multicationic supramolecular organic frameworks and porous organic polymers as porous antidotes to neutralize heparins. In vitro and in vivo experiments and biocompatibility evaluations confirm that the porous polymers can realize rapid, safe, and universal reversal of heparin&#8208;based anticoagulants, superior to that of clinically used protamine.








Abstract
Heparins are widely used anticoagulants for surgical procedures and extracorporeal therapies. However, all of them have bleeding risks. Protamine sulfate, the only clinically approved antidote for unfractionated heparin (UFH), has adverse effects. Moreover, protamine can only partially neutralize low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight heparins (LMWHs) and is not effective for fondaparinux. Here, an inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy for efficient neutralization of heparin anticoagulants by cationic porous supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) is reported. Isothermal titration calorimetric and fluorescence experiments show strong binding affinities of these porous polymers toward heparins, whereas dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis confirm that the heparin sequences are adsorbed into the interior of the porous hosts. Activated partial thromboplastin time, anti&#8208;FXa, and thromboelastography assays indicate that their neutralization efficacies are higher than or as high as that of protamine for UFH and generally superior to protamine for LMWHs and fondaparinux, which is further confirmed by tail&#8208;transection model in mice and ex vivo aPTT or anti&#8208;FXa analysis in rats. Acute toxicity evaluations reveal that one of the SOFs displays outstanding biocompatibility. This work suggests that porous polymers can supply safe and rapid reversal of clinically used heparins, as protamine surrogates, providing an improved approach for their neutralization.

         <title>Polyiodide Confinement by Starch Enables Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the significant chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, the shuttle effect of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is effectively addressed by using starch, which strongly anchors polyiodide anions due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. Benefiting from this structure confinement, a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% and an ultralong life of 50&#160;000 cycles are realized in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy&#8208;storage system owing to their high energy/power density, safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the significant chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, the shuttle effect of Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries is effectively addressed by using starch, which strongly anchors polyiodide anions due to its unique double-helix structure. Benefiting from this structure confinement, a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% and an ultralong life of 50&#160;000 cycles are realized in Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy-storage system owing to their high energy/power density, safety, and cost-effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Inspired by the chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, a structure confinement strategy is proposed to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries by hiring starch, due to its unique double-helix structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates an I&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; presents a much stronger bonding with starch than I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;, inhibiting the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries, which is confirmed by in situ ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectra. Consequently, a highly reversible Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;100% at 0.2 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and ultralong cycling stability (&amp;gt;50&#160;000 cycles) is realized. Simultaneously, the Zn corrosion triggered by polyiodide is effectively inhibited owing to the desirable shuttling-suppression by the starch, as evidenced by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. This work provides a new understanding of the failure mechanism of Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries and proposes a cheap but effective strategy to realize high-cyclability Zn&#8211;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Platelet Pharmacytes for the Hierarchical Amplification of Antitumor Immunity in Response to Self&#8208;Generated Immune Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive platelet pharmacytes, consisting of encapsulated Rab27a siRNA nanocomplexes and backpacked anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanogels, are engineered to hierarchically amplify antitumor immunity. The platelet pharmacytes efficiently silence Rab27a in tumor cells to inhibit secretion of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes, which relieves the immunosuppression and cascadingly releases anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Systemic immunosuppression mediated by tumor&#8208;derived exosomes is an important cause for the resistance of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Herein, self&#8208;adaptive platelet (PLT) pharmacytes are engineered to mediate cascaded delivery of exosome&#8208;inhibiting siRNA and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPDL1) toward synergized antitumor immunity. In the pharmacytes, polycationic nanocomplexes (NCs) assembled from Rab27 siRNA (siRab) and a membrane&#8208;penetrating polypeptide are encapsulated inside the open canalicular system of PLTs, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;responsive aPDL1 nanogels (NGs) are covalently backpacked on the PLT surface. Upon systemic administration, the pharmacytes enable prolonged blood circulation and active accumulation to tumors, wherein PLTs are activated to liberate siRab NCs, which efficiently transfect tumor cells, silence Rab27a, and inhibit exosome secretion. The immunosuppression is thus relieved, leading to the activation, proliferation, and tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, which trigger latent aPDL1 release. As such, the competitive aPDL1 exhaustion by PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing exosomes is minimized to sensitize ICB. Synergistically, siRab and aPDL1 induce strong antitumor immunological response and memory against syngeneic murine melanoma. This study reports a bioinspired mechanism to resolve the blood circulation/cell internalization contradiction of polycationic siRNA delivery systems, and renders an enlightened approach for the spatiotemporal enhancement of antitumor immunity.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ&#8208;NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR&#8208;NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported. Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ&#8208;NP induces efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR&#8208;NP also leads to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ&#8208;NP and HDR&#8208;NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.

         <title>Negative Phototransistors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Weak&#8208;Light Detection Based on 1D/2D Molecular Crystal p&#8211;n Heterojunctions and their Application in Light Encoders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive negative phototransistors are developed based on 1D/2D molecular crystal (1D/2DMC) p&#8211;n heterojunctions. This unique structure utilizes photogenerated holes of p&#8208;type 1DMCs to dope electron carriers in n&#8208;type 2DMC channels under UV illumination, achieving complete depletion of the channel current. The negative phototransistor exhibits superior performance parameters, accurately controllable threshold voltage by light, and ultrasensitive detection of weak light.








Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors in which the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). In this work, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8211;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (P) (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;108) and detectivity (D*) (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones), greatly outperforming previously reported NPTs, which are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signals by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for the development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

A sustainable, cheap, fast (100 A g&#8722;1), stable (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), and high&#8208;loading (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) polymer anode is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte, surpassing the Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Self&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolytes for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K) as the active material, dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors that operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode are demonstrated. Mode switching is done via changing the polarity of the applied voltages, enabled by the dual&#8208;mode absorption capabilities of CPE&#8208;K. These transistors are used to create reconfigurable logic gates, paving the way for the use of organic electrochemical transistors in emerging reconfigurable electronics.








Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, be power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. This work reports an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which then allows the transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode&#8208;switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. It in shown that dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. A device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors is developed. Finally, the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly is demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrTe3 for Fabrication of In&#8208;Plane CrTe3/CrTe2 Monolayer Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CrTe3 films are successfully synthesized. Monolayer (ML) CrTe3 represents a unique van der Waals (vdW) magnet with intralayer antiferromagnetism, which is identified by scanning probe microscopy. A facile method is developed to fabricate CrTe3/CrTe2 magnetic heterostructures from ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface, which is significant for the development of miniaturized spintronic devices based on vdW magnets.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) magnets are heavily pursued for potential applications in developing high&#8208;density miniaturized electronic/spintronic devices as well as for topological physics in low&#8208;dimensional structures. Despite the rapid advances in ultrathin ferromagnetic vdW magnets, the antiferromagnetic counterparts, as well as the antiferromagnetic junctions, are much less studied owing to the difficulties in both material fabrication and magnetism characterization. Ultrathin CrTe3 layers have been theoretically proposed to be a vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer (ML) and bilayer CrTe3 on graphite surface is demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the ML CrTe3 are characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The CrTe3 MLs can be further utilized for the fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of ML CrTe2 and ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since ML CrTe2 is a metallic vdW magnet, such a heterostructure presents the first in&#8208;plane magnetic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe3, as well as the magnetic heterojunction, will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.

Abstract
Surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, a facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation is proposed to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge. 2,5&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). Thus, a Li&#8211;O2 battery with 50&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m DBHQ delivers an extraordinary discharge capacity of 18&#160;945 mAh g&#8722;1 (i.e., 9.47 mAh cm&#8722;2), even surpassing the capacity endowed by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reduction mediator of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. Besides, an ultrahigh Li2O2 yield of 97.1% is also achieved due to the depressed reactivity of the reduced oxygen&#8208;containing species (O2&#8722;, LiO2, and Li2O2) by the solvating and antioxidative abilities of DBHQ. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ exhibits excellent cycling lifetime and rate capability. Furthermore, the generalizability of this approach of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge is verified by other soluble catalysts that contain &#63743;OH or &#63743;NH groups, with implications that could bring Li&#8211;O2 batteries one step closer to being a viable technology.

High&#8208;quality gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based heterostructures are epitaxially grown on a 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, based on which, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors are fabricated, suggesting a practical approach to realizing GaN/SiC hybrid field&#8208;effect transistors (HyFETs). The distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain relaxation in the III&#8211;nitride epilayer is revealed, offering a design guideline of such an unconventional vicinal epitaxy technique.








Abstract
A hybrid field&#8208;effect transistor (HyFET), superior for power electronic applications, can be created by harnessing the merits of two representative wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). Yet, the incompactness in the epitaxy techniques hinders the development of the HyFET&#8212;GaN is usually grown on on&#8208;axis foreign substrates including SiC, whereas SiC homoepitaxy prefers off&#8208;axis substrates. This work presents a GaN&#8208;based heterostructure epitaxially grown on a conventional 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;SiC substrate, which manifests its high quality and suitability for constructing GaN&#8208;based high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors, thereby suggesting a practical approach to realizing HyFETs. In the meanwhile, a distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain&#8208;relaxation process is proposed and studied with comprehensive characterizations.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;valence strategy and construction of an &#8220;all in one&#8221; electrode is employed to prepare flexible carbon fiber cloth supported porous CoxP hierarchical structures comprising nanoneedles and nanosheets. The as&#8208;prepared CoxP@CFC electrode exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance with a high reversible capacity (814&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate performance (279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and record ultralong cycling life (almost 100%&#160;capacity retention after 9000&#160;cycles).








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record&#8208;high capacity of 279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Tunable Planar Focusing Based on Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A planar polariton focusing device based on the natural in&#8208;plane hyperbolic van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is developed, which achieves ultrahigh field compression and wide&#8208;range tunable performance. Moreover, a graphene/&#945;&#8208;MoO3 heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.








Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy&#8208;transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are combined with tunable surface&#8208;plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

Lead Telluride Nanoparticles
Lead telluride nanoparticles spontaneously assemble into a spanning nanofiber network as reported by Nicholas A. Kotov and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201313. The resulting transparent nanoparticle hydrogels have potential application as UV or X&#8208;ray sensors. The network morphology can be modified through variations in the composition and concentration of added electrolyte. Evaluation of the network morphology with graph theory is used to derive correlations to the gels' mechanical and electrical properties.

Dendrimer Emitters
In article number 2110344, Dianming Sun, Xiaohong Zhang, Anna K&#246;hler, Eli Zysman&#8208;Colman, and co&#8208;workers report the rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimer emitters that show remarkable photophysical properties, resolving the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small activation energy and a large oscillator strength. Their use in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), which shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies, is demonstrated. The dendrimer design strategy provides a route to high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed TADF OLEDs and evidences the full potential of dendrimers as emissive materials.

Biohybrid Robots
The next robotics frontier will be led by biohybrids, robots that incorporate living biological cells and tissue, which are addressed by Miriam Filippi, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108427. Microfluidics substantially contributes to the development of biological tissue in vitro, as microfluidic flow control enables fluid regulation at the microscale and fine tissue structuring during biofabrication. Microfluidics will advance the co&#8208;assembly, scale&#8208;up, and integration of biohybrid robots, and make these robots performant and functional for real&#8208;world use.

         <title>Surface Modification of 2D Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the research of 2D photocatalysts has made great progress in the past decades, there are still many challenges in understanding the deep relationship between the surface state and the reaction mechanism. The surface modification strategies and reaction mechanisms of 2D photocatalysts are reviewed, and some useful views are put forward for future research in this field.








Abstract
2D materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. Herein, the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions, followed by specific surface modification strategies, is introduced. Fundamental principles focusing on light harvesting, charge separation, and molecular adsorption/activation in the 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based photocatalytic system are systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems, including water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D&#160;materials, the review is expected to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Microfluidic Tissue Engineering and Bio&#8208;Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidics enables the engineering of biological tissues through micro&#8208;precision control over the cell microenvironment, fabrication of cell&#8208;laden matrices, and distribution of fluids to perfuse 3D tissue constructs. In particular, microfluidically&#8208;advanced functional muscle tissues can be used as performant actuators in the next generation of bio&#8208;hybrid robots.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio&#8208;hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self&#8208;assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment. Cells require a sufficient exchange of nutrients and gases, which is guaranteed by convection and diffusive transport through liquid media. The functional development and long&#8208;term survival of biological tissues in vitro can be improved by dynamic flow culture, but only microfluidic flow control can develop tissue with fine structuring and regulation at the microscale. Full control of tissue growth at the microscale will eventually lead to functional macroscale constructs, which are needed as the biological component of soft bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in microfluidic techniques to engineer biological tissues, focusing on the use of muscle cells for robotic bio&#8208;actuation. Moreover, the instances in which bio&#8208;actuation technologies greatly benefit from fusion with microfluidics are highlighted, which include: the microfabrication of matrices, biomimicry of cell microenvironments, tissue maturation, perfusion, and vascularization.

         <title>Tuning Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Pathways for H2O2 Electrosynthesis via Engineering Atomically Dispersed Single Metal Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts in surface functionalization, coordination environments, and local carbon structures can effectively tune two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction pathways for efficient hydrogen peroxide production. The review summarizes recent progress on catalyst development and electrode design to electrolyzer fabrication for clean and sustainable hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation via the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative and green strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process and unsafe direct synthesis using H2 and O2. It enables on&#8208;site and decentralized H2O2 production using air and renewable electricity for various applications. Currently, atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts have emerged as the most promising platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR. Further tuning their central metal sites, coordination environments, and local structures can be highly active and selective for H2O2 production via the 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, recent methodologies and achievements on developing single metal site catalysts for selective O2 to H2O2 reduction are summarized. Combined with theoretical computation and advanced characterization, a structure&#8211;property correlation to guide rational catalyst design with a favorable 2e&#8722; ORR process is aimed to provide. Due to the oxidative nature of H2O2 and the derived free radicals, catalyst stability and effective solutions to improve catalyst tolerance to H2O2 are emphasized. Transferring intrinsic catalyst properties to electrode performance for viable applications always remains a grand challenge. The key performance metrics and knowledge during the electrolyzer development are, therefore, highlighted.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, we overcome the above challenges and perform systematic studies on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, we analytically obtain the band structure and geometric phase without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. We experimentally demonstrate the topological edge state as localized heat diffusion and verify its dependence on the boundary conditions. Our approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8208;Sb Nanoplate with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for both ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), but it is still formidable challenging. Herein, for the first time we have successfully prepared a novel Pd&#8208;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions. Detailed structural characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs) with Pd&#8208;terminated surface. Significantly, the unique Pd8Sb3 HPs can exhibit much enhanced activity towards the oxidation of various alcohols in alkaline media. In particular, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 4.5 A mgPd&#8211;1 towards EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In&#8208;situ electrochemical ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of EOR, which is the key to the improved activity. As further disclosed by the density functional theory calculations, the higher EOR intrinsic catalytic activity of Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. In addition, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can also show superior performance to both commercial Pd/C and Pt/C in cathodic ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of Pd&#8208;Sb nanostructure, which give huge impetus to the design of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Designing a Redox Heterojunction for Photocatalytic &#8220;Overall Nitrogen Fixation&#8221; under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in different components, realizing synchronous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products&#8212;photocatalytic &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221; reactions.








Abstract
Ammonia and nitrates are the most fundamental and significant raw ingredients in human society. Till now, industrial synthetic ammonia by Haber&#8211;Bosch process and industrial synthetic nitrates by the Ostwald process have encountered increasingly serious challenges, i.e., high energy consumption, high cost, and environment&#8208;harmful gas emissions. Therefore, developing alternative approaches to achieve nitrogen fixation to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the well&#8208;established Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald processes has fascinated scientists for many years, especially the simultaneous formation of ammonia and nitrate directly from N2 molecules, which has been rarely studied. Herein, a heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system is designed to successfully achieve &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation,&#8221; a sustainable and simultaneous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products under mild conditions. In this heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CdS and WO3 components. As a result, N2 molecules can be activated and reduced to ammonia products with yields of 35.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a multi&#8208;electron process, and synchronously oxidized into nitrate products with yields of 14.2&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a hole&#8208;induced oxidation coupling process. This work provides a novel insight and promising approach to realize artificial nitrogen fixation under mild condition.

         <title>Doping Compensation Enables High&#8208;Detectivity Infrared Organic Photodiodes for Image Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping compensation strategy is utilized to reduce the trap density and to enhance the external quantum efficiency simultaneously, leading to a greatly improved detectivity in infrared organic photodiodes. Consequently, high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density organic photodiodes arrays without pattering sensing layers are successfully applied in image capture.








Abstract
Infrared organic photodiodes have gained increasing attention due to their great application potentials in night vision, optical communication, and all&#8208;weather imaging. However, the commonly occurring high dark current and low detectivity impede infrared photodetectors from portable applications at room temperature. Herein, an efficient and generic doping compensation strategy is developed to improve the detectivity of infrared organic photodiodes. A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is investigated, and it is found that doping compensation strategy not only reduces the trap density of states and dark currents, but also restrains the nonradiative recombination with improved charge transport and collection. As a result, an ultralow noise spectral density of 8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 A Hz&#8722;1/2 as well as a high specific detectivity over 1013 Jones in 780&#8211;1070&#160;nm is achieved at room temperature. More importantly, the high&#8208;performance infrared organic photodiodes can be successfully applied in high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density image arrays without patterning sensing layers. These findings provide important compensation design insights that will be crucial to further improve the performance of infrared organic photodiodes in the future.

         <title>A Dual&#8208;Ligand Strategy to Regulate the Nucleation and Growth of Lead Chromate Photoanodes for Photoelectrochemical Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;ligand growth strategy in fabricating high&#8208;quality PbCrO4 thin film is demonstrated by slowing down crystal growth and inducing faster heterogeneous nucleation during annealing process. The dual&#8208;ligand strategy can effectively improve crystallinity, reduce defect density, and subsequently boosts superior charge separation efficiency up to &#8776;90%.








Abstract
Photoelectrochemical (PEC) water splitting for renewable hydrogen production has been regarded as a promising solution to utilize solar energy. However, most photoelectrodes still suffer from poor film quality and poor charge separation properties, mainly owing to the possible formation of detrimental defects including microcracks and grain boundaries. Herein, a molecular coordination engineering strategy is developed by employing acetylacetone (Acac) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dual ligands to regulate the nucleation and crystal growth of the lead chromate (PbCrO4) photoanode, resulting in the formation of a high&#8208;quality film with large grain size, well&#8208;stitched grain boundaries, and reduced oxygen vacancies defects. With these efforts, the nonradiative charge recombination is efficiently suppressed, leading to the enhancement of its charge separation efficiency from 47% to 90%. After decorating with Co&#8211;Pi cocatalyst, the PbCrO4 photoanode achieves a photocurrent density of 3.15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V (vs RHE under simulated AM1.5G) and an applied bias photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (ABPE) of 0.82%. This work provides a new strategy to modulate the nucleation and growth of high&#8208;quality photoelectrodes for efficient PEC water splitting.

         <title>An Open&#8208;Environment Tactile Sensing System: Toward Simple and Efficient Material Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intelligent triboelectric tactile sensing system is proposed that combines triboelectric nanogenerator technology and deep&#8208;learning technology. Independent of touch conditions and external environmental conditions, the tactile sensing system can achieve accurate, simple, and real&#8208;time material identification.








Abstract
Robotic perception can have simple and effective sensing functions that are unreachable for humans using only the isolated tactile perception method, with the assistance of a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG). However, the reliability of triboelectric sensors remains a major challenge due to the inherent environmental limitations. Here, an intelligent tactile sensing system that combines a TENG and deep&#8208;learning technology is proposed. Using a triboelectric triple tactile sensor array, typical characteristics of each testing material can be maintained stably even under different contact conditions (touch conditions and external environmental conditions) by extracting features from three independent electrical signals as well as the normalized output signals. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network model is integrated, and a high accuracy of 96.62% is achieved in a material identification task. The tactile sensing system is exhibited to an open environment for material identification and the real&#8208;time demonstration. Compared to the complex process that humans must integrate multiple sensing (touching and viewing) to accomplish tactile perception, the proposed sensing system shows a huge advantage in cognitive learning for the visually impaired, biomimetic prosthetics, and virtual spaces construction.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and has been widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, we extend the notion of band topology from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike the wave systems that are usually Hermitian, the diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. Via direct probe of the temperature diffusion, we experimentally retrieve the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice, and observe the emergence of topological edge decays within the gap of bulk decays. Our results show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorders. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based Adaptive Photo Encoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitute the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here we introduce a medium scale integrated (MSI) circuit comprised of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21 memtransistors based on photosensitive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer MoS2 for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information. We show that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, i.e., higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in our photo encoder is exploited for adaptive photo encoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1 &#956;J by the 2D memtransistor&#8208;based photo encoder highlights the benefits in&#8208;sensor and bio&#8208;inspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, A killer of Mg Anode in Mist</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/striping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg metal anode in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the Mg metal anode failure has raising concerns when cycling under practical areal capacity (&gt; 4&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, we illustrate that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in wide range of current densities (&#8804; 5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under the moderate current densities (0.1&#8208;1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing Mg metal anode failure or short circuit of battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, we illustrate that this current dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of Mg metal anode must be considered comprehensively for the practical Mg metal batteries.

         <title>Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High Performance Blue Energy Harvester</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8208;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fishes, we construct sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes which lead to high performance salinity gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from 1D straight nanochannel (45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8764;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude for charge density. Thus, abundant surface charge and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. We demonstrate new routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance.

         <title>Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light&#8208;absorption efficiency and high carrier&#8208;recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.








Abstract
Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance.

     alt="Strain Engineering: A Boosting Strategy for Photocatalysis"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Strain engineering is a prospective means to break the bottlenecks of photocatalysts, such as low light-absorption efficiency and high carrier-recombination rate. The recent advances of strain engineering are summarized from its basics, creations, characterizations and simulations, as well as the potential applications in photocatalysis. Moreover, a vision for the future strained photocatalysts is also put forward.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whilst the photocatalytic technique is considered to be one of the most significant routes to address the energy crisis and global environmental challenges, the solar-to-chemical conversion efficiency is still far from satisfying practical industrial requirements, which can be traced to the suboptimal bandgap and electronic structure of photocatalysts. Strain engineering is a universal scheme that can finely tailor the bandgap and electronic structure of materials, hence supplying a novel avenue to boost their photocatalytic performance. Accordingly, to explore promising directions for certain breakthroughs in strained photocatalysts, an overview on the recent advances of strain engineering from the basics of strain effect, creations of strained materials, as well as characterizations and simulations of strain level is provided. Besides, the potential applications of strain engineering in photocatalysis are summarized, and a vision for the future controllable-electronic-structure photocatalysts by strain engineering is also given. Finally, perspectives on the challenges for future strain-promoted photocatalysis are discussed, placing emphasis on the creation and decoupling of strain effect, and the modification of theoretical frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsically High Magnetic Performance in Core&#8211;Shell Structural (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;Based Permanent Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) in (Sm,Y)Fe12&#8208;based magnet is demonstrated via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process, resulting in the relatively high anisotropy field of 9.24 T in the optimized alloy. It provides an innovative strategy and has important significance for the design of high&#8208;performance magnets.








Abstract
ThMn12&#8208;type SmFe12&#8208;based permanent magnets have exhibited great potential in advanced magnet motors because of their high temperature stability of magnetic properties. However, the applications could be seriously limited due to the trade&#8208;off between phase stability and intrinsic magnetic properties. In this work, an effective solution is demonstrated by constructing the core&#8211;shell structure (Sm&#8208;rich shell and Y&#8208;rich core) via a spontaneous spinodal decomposition process. The anisotropy field for the (Sm0.75Y0.25)(Fe0.8Co0.2)11.25Ti0.75 alloy is mostly optimized to be 9.24 T at room temperature. Such an enhancement is ascribed to the pinning process of domain walls by the magnetic&#8208;hardening Sm&#8208;rich shell, which is directly observed by in situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy and reconstructed by micromagnetic simulation. Moreover, the phase stability and saturation magnetization are simultaneously increased, which is attributed to the synergistic effect of Y, Co, and Ti substitutions. More importantly, the high &#956;0Ms value of 1.52 T is comparable to the reported (Sm,Zr)Fe12&#8208;based bulk alloys that contain a larger amount of soft &#945;&#8208;Fe phases, indicating that this strategy is more promising toward bulk magnets. The present study provides a significant concept for the development of advanced permanent magnets and also has implications for understanding the structural origin of intrinsic magnetic configurations.

         <title>Triggering Lattice Oxygen Activation of Single&#8208;Atomic Mo Sites Anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe Oxyhydroxides Nanoarrays for Electrochemical Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atomic Mo sites anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxides nanoarrays are prepared, exhibiting superior performance toward the oxygen evolution reaction in alkaline media. In&#160;situ characterizations and the theoretical analysis collaboratively reveal that Mo incorporation triggers enhanced metal&#8211;oxygen covalency and improved reactivity of oxygen ligands, leading to feasible lattice oxygen oxidation mechanisms.








Abstract
Tuning the reactivity of lattice oxygen is of significance for lowering the energy barriers and accelerating the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Herein, single&#8208;atomic Mo sites are anchored on Ni&#8211;Fe oxyhydroxide nanoarrays by a facile metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived strategy, exhibiting superior performance toward the OER in alkaline media. In&#160;situ electrochemical spectroscopy and isotope&#8208;labeling experiments reveal the involvement of lattice oxygen during OER cycles. Combining theoretical and experimental investigations of the electronic configuration, it is comprehensively confirmed that the incorporation of single&#8208;atomic Mo sites enables higher oxidation state of the metal and strengthened metal&#8211;oxygen hybridization, as well as the formation of oxidized ligand holes above the Fermi level. In a word, the considerable acceleration of water oxidation is achieved via enhancing the reactivity of lattice oxygen and triggering the lattice oxygen activation. This work may provide new insights for designing ideal electrocatalysts via tuning the chemical state and activating the anions ligands.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication, protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15&#160;versus 19 h) and decreases in motility (30&#160;versus 15&#160;&#956;m/h). The cytosol viscosity increases 3&#8208;fold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by A Camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions and accumulates in mitochondria through electrostatic attraction. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. In vitro results indicate that the meta&#8208;Defensomes successfully reprogram mitochondrial metabolism of RAW 246.7&#8208;differentiated M1 macrophages by restoring aerobic respiration by scavenging mtROS and inhibiting mtNOS, thereby increasing TFAM expression. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into CIOA mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score. Therefore, reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in clinical practice.

         <title>Catalytic Growth of Ultralong Graphene Nanoribbons on Insulating Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micrometer&#8208;long graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of &#8776;2 nm are directly grown on insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrates through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition. These ultranarrow GNRs feature a typical bandgap of &#8776;1 eV, which is suitable for fabricating field&#8208;effect devices. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices.








Abstract
Graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with widths of a few nanometers are promising candidates for future nanoelectronic applications due to their structurally tunable bandgaps, ultrahigh carrier mobilities, and exceptional stability. However, the direct growth of micrometer&#8208;long GNRs on insulating substrates, which is essential for the fabrication of nanoelectronic devices, remains an immense challenge. Here, the epitaxial growth of GNRs on an insulating hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) substrate through nanoparticle&#8208;catalyzed chemical vapor deposition is reported. Ultranarrow GNRs with lengths of up to 10&#160;&#181;m are synthesized. Remarkably, the as&#8208;grown GNRs are crystallographically aligned with the h&#8208;BN substrate, forming 1D moir&#233; superlattices. Scanning tunneling microscopy reveals an average width of 2&#160;nm and a typical bandgap of &#8776;1&#160;eV for similar GNRs grown on conducting graphite substrates. Fully atomistic computational simulations support the experimental results and reveal a competition between the formation of GNRs and carbon nanotubes during the nucleation stage, and van der Waals sliding of the GNRs on the h&#8208;BN substrate throughout the growth stage. This&#160;study provides a scalable, single&#8208;step method for growing micrometer&#8208;long narrow GNRs on insulating substrates, thus opening a route to explore the performance of high&#8208;quality GNR devices and the fundamental physics of 1D moir&#233; superlattices.

         <title>A Print&#8208;and&#8208;Fuse Strategy for Sacrificial Filaments Enables Biomimetically Structured Perfusable Microvascular Networks with Functional Endothelium Inside 3D Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Melt electrowriting&#8208;printed thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) scaffolds with biomimetic geometry are integrated into customized microscopy&#8208;compliant bioreactor. Filling of the bioreactor with a hydrogel precursor solution induces fusion of adjacent filaments in the scaffolds (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Subsequent temperature decrease below the lower critical solution temperature produces perfusable microchannels with circular cross&#8208;sections, biomimetic volume&#8208;ratio between mother and daughter channels, and leakage&#8208;free fluid connection that enable rapid endothelialization.








Abstract
A facile and flexible approach for the integration of biomimetically branched microvasculature within bulk hydrogels is presented. For this, sacrificial scaffolds of thermoresponsive poly(2&#8208;cyclopropyl&#8208;2&#8208;oxazoline) (PcycloPrOx) are created using melt electrowriting (MEW) in an optimized and predictable way and subsequently placed into a customized bioreactor system, which is then filled with a hydrogel precursor solution. The aqueous environment above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) of PcycloPrOx at 25&#160;&#176;C swells the polymer without dissolving it, resulting in fusion of filaments that are deposited onto each other (print&#8208;and&#8208;fuse approach). Accordingly, an adequate printing pathway design results in generating physiological&#8208;like branchings and channel volumes that approximate Murray's law in the geometrical ratio between parent and daughter vessels. After gel formation, a temperature decrease below the LCST produces interconnected microchannels with distinct inlet and outlet regions. Initial placement of the sacrificial scaffolds in the bioreactors in a pre&#8208;defined manner directly yields perfusable structures via leakage&#8208;free fluid connections in a reproducible one&#8208;step procedure. Using this approach, rapid formation of a tight and biologically functional endothelial layer, as assessed not only through fluorescent dye diffusion, but also by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#8208;&#945;) stimulation, is obtained within three days.

         <title>Directing Charge Transfer in a Chemical&#8208;Bonded BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky Heterojunction for Piezoelectric Enhanced Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The BaTiO3@ReS2&#160;piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system with interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond exhibits excellent synergy between piezoelectric and photocatalytic. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric response can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons. The interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bond ensures the formation of a seamless contact interface and acts as the &#8220;bridge&#8221; for the electron transfer.








Abstract
The piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis system, which can utilize solar energy and mechanical energy simulteneously, is promising but still challenging in the environmental remediation field. In this work, a novel metal&#8211;semiconductor BaTiO3@ReS2 Schottky heterostructure is designed and it shows high&#8208;efficiency on piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic molecular oxygen activation. By combining experiment and calculation results, the distorted metal&#8208;phase ReS2 nanosheets are found to be closely anchored on the surface of the BaTiO3 nanorods, through interfacial Re&#63743;O covalent bonds. The Schottky heterostructure not only forms electron&#8208;transfer channels but also exhibits enhanced oxygen activation capacity, which are helpful to produce more superoxide radicals. The polarization field induced by the piezoelectric BaTiO3 can lower the Schottky barrier and thus reduce the transfer resistance of photogenerated electrons directing to the ReS2. As a result of the synergy effect between the two components, the BaTiO3@ReS2 exhibits untrahigh activity for degradation of pollutants with an apparent rate constant of 0.133 min&#8722;1 for piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis, which is 16.6 and 2.44 times as that of piezocatalysis and photocatalysis, respectively. This performance is higher than most reported BaTiO3&#8208;based piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalysis systems. This work paves the way for the design of high&#8208;efficiency piezo&#8208;assisted photocatalytic materials for environmental remediation through using green energies in nature.

         <title>Advances in the Development of Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for High&#8208;Energy&#8208;Density Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The cycling stability and rate performance of Li&#8211;S batteries are adversely affected by the formation of Li dendrites and the polysulfide shuttle effect. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) can effectively guide Li deposition and suppress polysulfide migration, thus holding great promise for Li&#8211;S batteries. The recent progress in the development of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically summarized and analyzed.








Abstract
Although lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (&#8776;100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy&#8208;storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li&#8208;metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li&#8211;S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li&#8211;S batteries as well as other metal&#8211;S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li&#8211;S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.

Single-atom catalysts (SACs) can effectively guide Li deposition and suppress polysulfide migration, thus holding great promise for Li&#8211;S batteries. The recent progress in the development of SACs for Li&#8211;S batteries is systematically summarized and analyzed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are promising next-generation energy-storage systems, their practical applications are limited by the growth of Li dendrites and lithium polysulfide shuttling. These problems can be mitigated through the use of single-atom catalysts (SACs), which exhibit the advantages of maximal atom utilization efficiency (&#8776;100%) and unique catalytic properties, thus effectively enhancing the performance of electrode materials in energy-storage devices. This review systematically summarizes the recent progress in SACs intended for use in Li-metal anodes, S cathodes, and separators, briefly introducing the operating principles of Li&#8211;S batteries, the action mechanisms of the corresponding SACs, and the fundamentals of SACs activity, and then comprehensively describes the main strategies for SACs synthesis. Subsequently, the applications of SACs and the principles of SACs operation in reinforced Li&#8211;S batteries as well as other metal&#8211;S batteries are individually illustrated, and the major challenges of SACs usage in Li&#8211;S batteries as well as future development directions are presented.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Dual&#8208;Directional Sulfur Redox via a Biotemplated Single&#8208;Atomic Fe&#8211;N2 Mediator Promises Durable Li&#8211;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Fe&#8211;N2 single&#8208;atomic catalyst accommodated by a biomorphic hierarchical C3N4 support from a biomass template readily boosts the dual&#8208;directional conversion kinetics of lithium sulfide and realizes high&#8208;performance Li&#8722;S batteries.








Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) battery is considered as an appealing candidate for next&#8208;generation electrochemical energy storage systems because of high energy and low cost. Nonetheless, its development is plagued by the severe polysulfide shuttling and sluggish reaction kinetics. Although single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have emerged as a promising remedy to expedite sulfur redox chemistry, the mediocre single&#8208;atom loading, inferior atomic utilization, and elusive catalytic pathway handicap their practical application. To tackle these concerns, in this work, unsaturated Fe single atoms with high loading capacity (&#8776;6.32 wt%) are crafted on a 3D hierarchical C3N4 architecture (3DFeSA&#8208;CN) by means of biotemplated synthesis. By electrokinetic analysis and theoretical calculations, it is uncovered that the 3DFeSA&#8208;CN harnesses robust electrocatalytic activity to boost dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox. As a result, S@3DFeSA&#8208;CN can maintain a durable cyclic performance with a negligible capacity decay rate of 0.031% per cycle over 2000 cycles at 1.0 C. More encouragingly, an assembled Li&#8211;S battery with a sulfur loading of 5.75&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 can harvest a high areal capacity of 6.18 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work offers a promising solution to optimize the carbonaceous support and coordination environment of SACs, thereby ultimately elevating dual&#8208;directional sulfur redox in pragmatic Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>A High&#8208;Energy and Safe Lithium Battery Enabled by Solid&#8208;State Redox Chemistry in a Fireproof Gel Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of a molecular Li2S cathode and Si anode in a fireproof gel electrolyte enables a high&#8208;energy quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery with long life, good temperature adaptability, negligible self&#8208;discharge, and remarkable safety against extreme abuse in the air, water, or even on fire.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed thriving efforts in pursuing high&#8208;energy batteries at an unaffordable cost of safety. Herein, a high&#8208;energy and safe quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium battery is proposed by solid&#8208;state redox chemistry of polymer&#8208;based molecular Li2S cathode in a fireproof gel electrolyte. This chemistry fully eliminates not only the negative effect of extremely reactive Li metal and oxygen species on cell safety but also the damage of electrode reversibility by soluble redox intermediates. The molecular Li2S cathode exhibits an exceptional lifetime of 2000 cycles, 100% Coulombic efficiency, high capacity of 830 mA&#160;h g&#8722;1 with ultralow capacity loss of 0.005&#8211;0.01% per cycle and superior rate capability up to 10 C. Meanwhile, it shows high stability in the carbonate&#8208;involving electrolyte for maximizing the compatibility with carbonate&#8208;efficient Si anode. The optimized cell chemistry exerts high energy over 750&#160;W&#160;h kg&#8722;1 for 500 cycles with fast rate response, high&#8208;temperature adaptability, and no self&#8208;discharge. A fire&#8208;retardant composite gel electrolyte is developed to further strengthen the intrinsic safe redox between the Li2S cathode and the Si anode, which secures remarkable safety against extreme abuse of overheating, short circuits, and mechanical damage in air/water or even when on fire.

         <title>Enhancing Transition Dipole Moments of Heterocyclic Semiconductors via Rational Nitrogen&#8208;Substitution for Sensitive Near Infrared Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic semiconductors with stretched geometry show enhanced transition dipole moments, leading to large absorption coefficients of up to 4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1 beyond 900&#160;nm in thin films. The self&#8208;powered organic photodetectors in this work show high detectivity (1012 to 2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones) over a broad spectrum of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm, comparable with some commercial inorganic photodetectors.








Abstract
Designing ultrastrong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorbing organic semiconductors is a critical prerequisite for sensitive NIR thin film organic photodetectors (OPDs), especially in the region of beyond 900&#160;nm, where the absorption coefficient of commercial single crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) is below 103 cm&#8722;1. Herein, a pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;b]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]pyrrole heterocyclic core (named as BPPT) with strong electron&#8208;donating property and stretched geometry is developed. Relative to their analogue Y6, BPPT&#8208;contained molecules, BPPT&#8208;4F and BPPT&#8208;4Cl, show substantially upshifted and more delocalized highest occupied molecular orbitals, and larger transition dipole moments, leading to bathochromic and hyperchromic absorption spectra extending beyond 1000&#160;nm with very large absorption coefficients (up to 3.7&#8211;4.3 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) as thin films. These values are much higher than those (104 to 1 &#215; 105 cm&#8722;1) of typical organic semiconductors, and 1&#8211;2 orders higher than those of commercial inorganic materials, such as c&#8208;Si, Ge, and InGaAs. The OPDs based on BPPT&#8208;4F or BPPT&#8208;4Cl blending polymer PBDB&#8208;T show high detectivity of above 1012 Jones in a wide wavelength range of 310&#8211;1010&#160;nm with excellent peak values of 1.3&#8211;2.2 &#215; 1013 Jones, respectively, which are comparable with and even better than those commercial inorganic photodetectors.

         <title>Tailoring Oxygen Reduction Reaction Pathway on Spinel Oxides via Surficial Geometrical&#8208;Site Occupation Modification Driven by the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is crucial for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production, which proceeds via four&#8208;electron or two&#8208;electron pathways, respectively. Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&#8722; or the 2e&#8722; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo2O4 can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.








Abstract
The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated as a critical technology for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production. Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo2O4 oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e&#8722; ORR and 4e&#8722; ORR. Interestingly, the as&#8208;synthesized MnCo2O4&#8208;pristine (MnCo2O4&#8208;P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H2O2 selectivity (&#8776;80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75&#160;V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo2O4&#8208;activation (MnCo2O4&#8208;A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four&#8208;electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half&#8208;wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92&#160;V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo2O4&#8208;A toward the 4e&#8722; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.

Special electrocatalysts to promote either the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; or the 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; reaction route are important. The surficial metals occupation of partially inverse MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can be tuned to realize this reaction mechanism switching.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) has been demonstrated as a critical technology for both energy conversion technologies and hydrogen peroxide intermediate production. Herein, an in situ oxygen evolution reaction (OER) surface evolution strategy is applied for changing the surface structure of MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; oxide with tetrahedral and octahedral cations vacancies to realize reaction pathway switching from 2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR and 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ORR. Interestingly, the as-synthesized MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-pristine (MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-P) with the highest surficial Mn/Co octahedron occupation favors two electrons reaction routes exhibiting high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (&#8776;80% and reaches nearly 100% at 0.75&#160;V vs RHE); after surface atoms reconstruction, MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-activation (MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-A) with the largest Mn/Co tetrahedron occupation present excellent ORR performance through the four-electron pathway with an ultrahigh onset potential and half-wave potential of 0.78 and 0.92&#160;V, ideal mass activity (MA), and turnover frequencies (TOF) values. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal the concurrent modulations of both Co and Mn by the surface reconstructions, which improve the electroactivity of MnCo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-A toward the 4e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; pathway. This work provides a new perspective to building correlation of OER activation&#8211;ORR property, bringing detailed understating for reaction route transformation, and thus guiding the development of certain electrocatalysts with specific purposes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic Circularly Polarized Luminescence with Tunable Handedness and Intensity Enabled by Achiral Dichroic Dyes in Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Medium</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes, P1 and N1, are designed as anisotropic chromophores in the long and short molecular axes with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl derivatives in SLC1717 medium. Dynamic circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) handedness and intensity are achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|.








Abstract
Cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) are chiral supramolecular systems that self&#8208;assemble into a highly regular helical arrangement in a liquid crystal (LC) medium. Such an arrangement is highly beneficial for the chiral enlargement effect on circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) signals. Dichroic dyes with rod&#8208;like molecular structures can exhibit fluorescence anisotropy along both the long and short molecular axes owing to their transition dipole moment (TDM) vectors. In this work, a pair of donor&#8211;accepter (D&#8211;A) achiral dichroic dyes is prepared, namely, 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene derivative (P1, whose TDM vector is parallel to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&gt; F&#8869;) and anthraquinone derivative (N1, whose TDM vector is perpendicular to the long axis of the molecule, i.e., F||&#160;&lt; F&#8869;). CLCs can be fabricated by doping P1 or N1 together with chiral 1,1&#8242;&#8208;binaphthyl&#8208;derived inducers into SLC1717 medium. Dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity is achieved by changing the N1:P1 mass ratio, and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (gem) value reaches |0.71|. This work describes the first observation of dynamic CPL with tunable handedness and intensity enabled by TDM regulation of achiral dichroic dyes in a CLC medium.

         <title>Microstructured Hydrogels to Guide Self&#8208;Assembly and Function of Lung Alveolospheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epithelial cell organoids provide a system to probe tissue development and disease in vitro and for cell transplantation. Within the lung field, alveolar organoids almost exclusively depend on Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions. In this work, the design of an accessible hydrogel system with predefined microcavities to generate alveolar organoids through self&#8208;assembly and maintenance of progenitor cell fate and function is described.








Abstract
Epithelial cell organoids have increased opportunities to probe questions on tissue development and disease in vitro and for therapeutic cell transplantation. Despite their potential, current protocols to grow these organoids almost exclusively depend on culture within 3D Matrigel, which limits defined culture conditions, introduces animal components, and results in heterogenous organoids (i.e., shape, size, composition). Here, a method is described that relies on hyaluronic acid hydrogels for the generation and expansion of lung alveolar organoids (alveolospheres). Using synthetic hydrogels with defined chemical and physical properties, human&#8208;induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)&#8208;derived alveolar type 2 cells (iAT2s) self&#8208;assemble into alveolospheres and propagate in Matrigel&#8208;free conditions. By engineering predefined microcavities within these hydrogels, the heterogeneity of alveolosphere size and structure is reduced when compared to 3D culture, while maintaining the alveolar type 2 cell fate of human iAT2&#8208;derived progenitor cells. This hydrogel system is a facile and accessible system for the culture of iPSC&#8208;derived lung progenitors and the method can be expanded to the culture of primary mouse tissue derived AT2 and other epithelial progenitor and stem cell aggregates.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition (IVD) Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, we report the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition (IVD). This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and co&#8208;evaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>Ni&#8211;Co Bimetallic Hydroxide Nanosheet Arrays Anchored on Graphene for Adsorption&#8208;Induced Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of transition metal hydroxide NixCoy&#8211;graphene oxide (GR) composites forming porous aerogels with hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure are synthesized by using a simple in situ growth method. Through doping with an appropriate amount of electron&#8208;rich Co, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits the best photocatalytic performance due to excellent CO2 adsorption capacity, photoinduced electron/hole separation, and electron&#8208;transport efficiency.








Abstract
Photocatalytic CO2 reduction can be implemented to use CO2, a greenhouse gas, as a resource in an energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly way, in which suitable catalytic materials are required to achieve high&#8208;efficiency catalysis. Insufficient accessible active sites on the catalyst surface and inhibited electron transfer severely limit the photocatalytic performance. Therefore, porous aerogels are constructed from composites comprising different ratios of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide (NixCoy) grown on reduced graphene oxide (GR) into a hierarchical nanosheet&#8208;array structure using a facile in situ growth method. Detailed characterization shows that this structure exposes numerous active sites for enhanced adsorption&#8208;induced photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Moreover, under the synergistic effect of Ni&#8211;Co bimetallic hydroxide, the CO2 adsorption capacity as well as charge&#8208;carrier separation and transfer are excellent. As a result, the Ni7Co3&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;g&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO2. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.

As a result, the Ni&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#8211;GR catalyst exhibits highly improved catalytic performance when compared with recently reported values, with a high CO release rate of 941.5&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a selectivity of 96.3% during the photocatalytic reduction of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This work demonstrates a new strategy for designing nanocomposites with abundant active sites structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

In&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, NFMO with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V).








Abstract
The layered sodium transition metal oxide, NaTMO2 (TM = transition metal), with a binary or ternary phases has displayed outstanding electrochemical performance as a new class of strategy cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, an in&#8208;depth phase analysis of developed Na1&#8722;xTMO2 cathode materials, Na0.76Ni0.20Fe0.40Mn0.40O2 with P2&#8208; and O3&#8208;type phases (NFMO&#8208;P2/O3) is offered. Structural visualization on an atomic scale is also provided and the following findings are unveiled: i) the existence of a mixed&#8208;phase intergrowth layer distribution and unequal distribution of P2 and O3 phases along two different crystal plane indices and ii) a complete reversible charge/discharge process for the initial two cycles that displays a simple phase transformation, which is unprecedented. Moreover, first&#8208;principles calculations support the evidence of the formation of a binary NFMO&#8208;P2/O3 compound, over the proposed hypothetical monophasic structures (O3, P3, O&#8242;3, and P2 phases). As a result, the synergetic effect of the simultaneous existence of P&#8208; and O&#8208;type phases with their unique structures allows an extraordinary level of capacity retention in a wide range of voltage (1.5&#8211;4.5 V). It is believed that the insightful understanding of the proposed materials can introduce new perspectives for the development of high&#8208;voltage cathode materials for SIBs.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Modules via Bilayer&#8208;Merged&#8208;Annealing Assisted Blade Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance organic solar modules by blade coating are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing strategy, achieving impressive power conversion efficiency of 14.79% with an active area of 18.73 cm2, which represents the best organic solar minimodule by blade coating so far.








Abstract
Although encouraging progress is being made on spin&#8208;coated prototype cells, organic solar cells (OSCs) still face significant challenges, yet to be explored, for upscaling the multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers in the construction of large&#8208;area modules. Herein, high&#8208;performance opaque and semitransparent organic solar modules are developed via a bilayer&#8208;merged&#8208;annealing (BMA)&#8208;assisted blade&#8208;coating strategy, achieving impressive efficiencies of 14.79% and 12.01% with respect to active area of 18.73 cm2, which represent the best organic solar minimodules so far. It is revealed that the BMA strategy effectively resolves the de&#8208;wetting issues between polar charge transport layer solution and non&#8208;polar bulk heterojunction blends, hence improving the film coverage, along with electronic and electric contacts of multi&#8208;stacked photoactive layers. As result, organic solar modules coated under ambient conditions successfully retain the high&#8208;efficiency of small&#8208;area cells upon 312 times area scaling&#8208;up. Overall, this work provides a facile and effective method to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar modules under ambient conditions.

         <title>Activatable Cancer Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy using Semiconducting Polymer Nanobodies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable organic nanobody (SPNAb) is developed for cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy. Ultrasound irradiation of SPNAb can not only induce immunogenic cell death by sonodynamic therapy but also activate anti&#8208;CTLA4 antibodies to in situ trigger checkpoint blockade, resulting in enhanced systemic antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Despite the great promises of sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in combination cancer therapy, its clinical applications are hindered by the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activities of therapeutic agents and the lack of efficient sonosensitizers. Herein, the development of semiconducting polymers as efficient sonosensitizers and further development of sono&#8208;immunotherapeutic nanobodies (SPNAb) for activatable cancer sono&#8208;immunotherapy are reported. Conjugation of anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies onto the polymer nanoparticles through a 1O2&#8208;cleavable linker affords SPNAb with relatively low CTLA&#8208;4 binding affinity. Upon sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNAb generates 1O2 not only to elicit a sonodynamic effect to induce immunogenic cell death, but also to release anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibodies and trigger in situ checkpoint blockade. Such a synergistic therapeutic action mediated by SPNAb modulates the tumoricidal function of T&#8208;cell immunity by promoting the proliferation of cytotoxic T lymphocytes and depleting immunosuppressive regulatory T cells, resulting in effective tumor regression, metastasis inhibition, durable immunological memory, and prevention of relapse. Therefore, this study represents a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept sonodynamic strategy using semiconducting polymers for precise spatiotemporal control over immunotherapy.

         <title>Dendrimersome Synthetic Cells Harbor Cell Division Machinery of Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. The interactions between this active cell machinery and the synthetic membrane are tailored by adjusting its composition. Such fine&#8208;tuning enables the reproduction of the natural dynamic behavior in a synthetic system and constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements.








Abstract
The integration of active cell machinery with synthetic building blocks is the bridge toward developing synthetic cells with biological functions and beyond. Self&#8208;replication is one of the most important tasks of living systems, and various complex machineries exist to execute it. In Escherichia coli, a contractile division ring is positioned to mid&#8208;cell by concentration oscillations of self&#8208;organizing proteins (MinCDE), where it severs membrane and cell wall. So far, the reconstitution of any cell division machinery has exclusively been tied to liposomes. Here, the reconstitution of a rudimentary bacterial divisome in fully synthetic bicomponent dendrimersomes is shown. By tuning the membrane composition, the interaction of biological machinery with synthetic membranes can be tailored to reproduce its dynamic behavior. This constitutes an important breakthrough in the assembly of synthetic cells with biological elements, as tuning of membrane&#8211;divisome interactions is the key to engineering emergent biological behavior from the bottom&#8208;up.

         <title>Local Spin&#8208;State Tuning of Iron Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst by S&#8208;Coordinated Doping for Kinetics&#8208;Boosted Ammonia Synthesis</title>

An atomically dispersed monovalent iron(I) site with a medium&#8208;spin state is developed to promote cleavage of the N&#8801;N bonds and facilitate the rate&#8208;determining step of N2 hydrogenation kinetics.








Abstract
The electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (e&#8208;NRR) is envisaged as alternative technique to the Haber&#8211;Bosch process for NH3 synthesis. However, how to develop highly active e&#8208;NRR catalysts faces daunting challenges. Herein, a viable strategy to manipulate local spin state of isolated iron sites through S&#8208;coordinated doping (FeSA&#8208;NSC) is reported. Incorporation of S in the coordination of FeSA&#8208;NSC can induce the transition of spin&#8208;polarization configuration with the formation of a medium&#8208;spin&#8208;state of Fe (t2g6 eg1), which is beneficial for facilitating eg electrons to penetrate the antibonding &#960;&#8208;orbital of nitrogen. As a consequence, a record&#8208;high current density up to 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 can be achieved, together with a high NH3 selectivity of &#8776;10% in a flow cell reactor. Both experimental and theoretical analyses indicate that the monovalent Fe(I) atomic center in the FeSA&#8208;NSC after the S doping accelerates the N2 activation and protonation in the rate&#8208;determining step of *N2 to *NNH.

         <title>Recyclable, Healable, and Tough Ionogels Insensitive to Crack Propagation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irreversible covalent crosslinking in the matrix polymer network is avoided. The reversible entangled microdomains of the microspheres and linear segments in tough ionogels act as elastic physical crosslinking points to provide mechanical stability, dissipate stress concentration, and prevent crack propagation in any load direction. The entangled networks can be disentangled to restore the damaged mechanical properties and realize recycling.








Abstract
Most gels and elastomers introduce sacrificial bonds in the covalent network to dissipate energy. However, long&#8208;term cyclic loading caused irreversible fatigue damage and crack propagation cannot be prevented. Furthermore, because of the irreversible covalent crosslinked networks, it is a huge challenge to implement reversible mechanical interlocking and reorganize the polymer segments to realize the recycling and reuse of ionogels. Here, covalent crosslinking of host materials is replaced with entanglement. The entangled microdomains are used as physical crosslinking while introducing reversible bond interactions. The interpenetrating, entangled, and elastic microdomains of linear segments and covalent&#8208;network microspheres provide mechanical stability, eliminate stress concentration at the crack tip under load, and achieve unprecedented tear and fatigue resistance of ionogels in any load direction. Moreover, reversible entanglements and noncovalent interactions can be disentangled and recombined to achieve recycling and mechanical regeneration, and the recyclability of covalent&#8208;network microdomains is realized.

         <title>Unusual Mesoporous Titanium Niobium Oxides Realizing Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries Operated at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unusual mesoporous titanium niobium oxides@carbon (Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C) with large pore sizes and highly crystallized nanocrystals embedded in carbon frameworks are synthesized via a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy. As an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C shows exceptional performances at room temperature and even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) are a promising candidate for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, however, the sluggish ion&#8208;diffusion kinetics brought by the large radius of Na+ seriously limits the performance of SIBs, let alone at low temperatures. Herein, a confined acid&#8211;base pair self&#8208;assembly strategy to synthesize unusual Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C for high&#8208;performance SIBs operating at room and low temperatures is proposed. The confinement self&#8208;assembly of the acid&#8211;base pair around the micelles and confined crystallization by the carbon layer realize the formation of ordered and stoichiometric mesoporous frameworks with opened ion channels. Thus, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8722;x@C exhibits rapid Na+ diffusion kinetics at 25 and &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, which are one order higher than that of the nonporous one. A high reversible capacity of 233 mAh g&#8722;1, excellent rate (a specific capacity of 103 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 C), and cycling performances (&lt;0.03% fading per cycle) can be observed at 25&#160;&#176;C. More importantly, even at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C, the mesoporous Ti0.88Nb0.88O4&#8211;x@C can still deliver the 161 mAh g&#8722;1 capacity, a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 60% and outstanding cycling stability (99 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 C after 500 cycles). It is believed this strategy opens a new avenue for constructing novel mesoporous electrode materials for low&#8208;temperature energy storage.

         <title>Orbital Angular Momentum Multiplexing in Space&#8211;Time Thermoacoustic Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Space&#8211;time thermoacoustic metasurface possess unusual capacities to simultaneously manipulate sound field distributions and harmonic frequency responses. Along this frontier, a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing technique is established with a superposition of vortex beams carrying orthogonal orbital&#8208;angular&#8208;momentum modes at distinct frequency harmonics. The synthesized dimensionality introduces entirely new physics and design philosophies to multiplexing schemes, promising unprecedented functionalities in acoustic communication devices.








Abstract
Multiplexing technology with increased information capacity plays a crucial role in the realm of acoustic communication. Different quantities of sound waves, including time, frequency, amplitude, phase, and orbital angular momentum (OAM), have been independently introduced as the physical multiplexing approach to allow for enhanced communication densities. An acoustic metasurface is decorated with carbon nanotube patches, which when electrically pumped and set to rotate, functions as a hybrid mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexer with synthetic dimensions. Based on this spatiotemporal modulation, a superposition of vortex beams with orthogonal OAMs and symmetric harmonics are both numerically and experimentally demonstrated. Also, flexible combinations of OAM modes with diverse frequency shifts are obtained by transforming the azimuthal phase distributions, which inspires a mode&#8208;frequency&#8208;division multiplexing approach that significantly promotes the communication&#160;capacity.

         <title>A Stacked Plasmonic Metamaterial with Strong Localized Electric Field Enables Highly Efficient Broadband Light&#8208;Driven CO2 Hydrogenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation is achieved by coupling a broadband plasmonic metamaterial absorber with a single Cu atoms based alloy as catalytic sites. The design perfectly synergizes the effects of photothermal conversion, plasmonic hot electrons, and strong localized electric field.








Abstract
Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO2 photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that are implemented in such an application are restricted in a narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with a designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, a concept of coupling a Au&#8208;based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites, respectively, is reported for gas&#8208;phase light&#8208;driven catalytic CO2 hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in a broad spectral range (370&#8211;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, and also induces strong localized electric field in favor of transfer of hot electrons and reduced energy barrier in CO2 hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of a strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light&#8208;driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient light-driven catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation is achieved by coupling a broadband plasmonic metamaterial absorber with a single Cu atoms based alloy as catalytic sites. The design perfectly synergizes the effects of photothermal conversion, plasmonic hot electrons, and strong localized electric field.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Light utilization largely governs the performance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoconversion, whereas most of the materials that are implemented in such an application are restricted in a narrow spectral absorption range. Plasmonic metamaterials with a designable regular pattern and facile tunability are excellent candidates for maximizing light absorption to generate substantial hot electrons and thermal energy. Herein, a concept of coupling a Au-based stacked plasmonic metamaterial with single Cu atoms in alloy, as light absorber and catalytic sites, respectively, is reported for gas-phase light-driven catalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. The metamaterial structure works in a broad spectral range (370&#8211;1040&#160;nm) to generate high surface temperature for photothermal catalysis, and also induces strong localized electric field in favor of transfer of hot electrons and reduced energy barrier in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; hydrogenation. This work unravels the significant role of a strong localized electric field in photothermal catalysis and demonstrates a scalable fabrication approach to light-driven catalysts based on plasmonic metamaterials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Energy Conversion Analysis of Multilayered Triboelectric Nanogenerators for Synergistic Rain and Solar Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance instantaneous triboelectric nanogenerator (I&#8208;TENG) and a quantitative analysis method named &#8220;kinetic energy calculation and current integration&#8221; (KECCI) are developed to promote the understanding of energy flows and working principles of TENGs in&#8208;depth. Furthermore, multi&#8208;layered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics to work synergistically. This work guides the further development of TENG and promotes its commercialization process.








Abstract
The triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is an emerging technology that offers excellent potential for the conversion of mechanical energy from rain into electricity for hybrid energy applications. However, a high&#8208;performance TENG is yet to be achieved because a quantitative analysis method for the energy conversion process is still lacking. Herein, a quantitative analysis method, termed the "kinetic energy calculation and current integration" (KECCI) method, which significantly improves the understanding of the mechanical&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion process, is presented. Based on the KECCI method, a high&#8208;performance TENG is developed by systematically optimizing a biomimetic surface structure and instant switch design, with 1.25&#160;mA short&#8208;circuit current (Isc), 150&#160;V open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc), and a high energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 24.89%. Furthermore, a multilayered TENG device is proposed for continuously harvesting the kinetic energy of raindrops for further improvement in the energy&#8208;conversion efficiency. Finally, the multilayered TENGs are integrated with organic photovoltaics, achieving all&#8208;weather energy harvesting. This work presents a validated theoretical basis that will guide further development of TENGs toward higher performances, which will promote the commercialization of hybrid TENG systems for all&#8208;weather applications.

         <title>CO2&#8208;Induced Melting and Solvation Reconfiguration of Phase&#8208;Change Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gaseous CO2 can promote the melting and reconfigure the solvation structure of a phase&#8208;change electrolyte, thereby enhancing interactions between salt anions and Li+ cations to upgrade the solid electrolyte interphase layer. Ultimately, a Li&#8211;LiFePO4 battery with CO2&#8208;saturated electrolyte exhibits prolonged cycle life. Furthermore, a Li&#8211;CO2 battery with the baseline electrolyte can cycle stably for nearly 100 cycles at 200 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) are a unique and exciting class of materials with bright prospects in wide&#8208;ranging sustainable technologies such as thermal and electrochemical energy storage. While impressive, the effect of gaseous species on PCMs remains largely unexplored hitherto. Here, a gaseous co&#8208;solvent is reported that can facilitate melting and modulate physical properties such as viscosity and ion conduction of PCMs. Especially for the appealing application of PCMs as electrolytes, gaseous species also have a critical influence on both Li+&#8208;electrolyte structure and resultant solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Specifically, theoretical simulations and experimental analysis evidence that CO2 can promote melting while reconfiguring the solvation structure of a succinonitrile (SCL)&#8208;derived Li+ phase&#8208;change electrolyte (Li+&#8208;PCE) model system. Due to the enhanced interaction between Li+ cations and bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI&#8208;) anions in the reconfigured solvation structure, more TFSI&#8208;&#8208;derived F&#8208;rich component and extra CO2&#8208;derived Li2CO3 form in the upgraded SEI layer, thereby endowing proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept Li&#8208;metal batteries with prolonged cyclability. These findings may stimulate widespread interest in gas leverage to innovate electrolyte chemistry.

         <title>Cellulose Nanocrystal Aqueous Colloidal Suspensions: Evidence of Density Inversion at the Isotropic&#8208;Liquid Crystal Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new low&#8208;density liquid crystalline (LC) phase in aqueous colloidal suspensions of rod&#8208;like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) is demonstrated. This behavior is an indication that the LC phase is an indirect way to reveal CNCs/water interactions. The scale bar in the image is 100&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The colloidal suspensions of aqueous cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs) are known to form liquid crystalline (LC) systems above certain critical concentrations. From an isotropic phase, tactoid formation, growth, and sedimentation have been determined as the genesis of a high&#8208;density cholesteric phase, which, after drying, originates solid iridescent films. Herein, the coexistence of a liquid crystal upper phase and an isotropic bottom phase in CNC aqueous suspensions at the isotropic&#8211;nematic phase separation is reported. Furthermore, isotropic spindle&#8208;like domains are observed in the low&#8208;density LC phase and high&#8208;density LC phases are also prepared. The CNCs isolated from the low&#8208; and high&#8208;density LC phases are found to have similar average lengths, diameters, and surface charges. The existence of an LC low&#8208;density phase is explained by the presence of air dissolved in the water present within the CNCs. The air dissolves out when the water solidifies into ice and remains within the CNCs. The self&#8208;adjustment of the cellulose chain conformation enables the entrapment of air within the CNCs and CNC buoyancy in aqueous suspensions.

         <title>Metalloid&#8208;Cluster Ligands Enabling Stable and Active FeN4&#8208;Ten Motifs for the Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
p&#8208;Block metalloid clusters (e.g., Ten) are found to be able to effectively mimic the role of molecular ligands in enzymes. When incorporated into a pyrolyzed FeN4&#8208;carbon framework, the obtained FeN4&#8208;Ten catalyst not only mimics the coordination chemistry and catalytic behavior of CYP enzymes, but also keeps the stable nature as a heterogeneous catalyst.








Abstract
In nature, the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is catalyzed by cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes containing heme iron centers with an axial thiolate ligand (FeN4&#8208;S), which are among the most finely developed catalysts by natural selection. However, the exceptional ORR activity and selectivity of CYP enzymes originate from their non&#8208;rigid and self&#8208;adaptive coordination network with molecular ligands, which sacrifices the stability of the active motifs under electrochemical reaction conditions. Here, a design strategy to circumvent this dilemma by incorporating Fe&#8208;N4 motifs into carbon matrices instead of the protein scaffold and replacing the axial molecular thiolate ligand with a stable tellurium cluster (Ten) is demonstrated. Theoretical calculations indicate a moderate interaction between Fe 3d and Te 5p orbitals once n&#160;&gt; 2, allowing the Fe&#63743;Te bond to dynamically change its strength to adaptively facilitate the intermediate steps during the ORR process, which renders FeN4&#8208;Ten active sites with superior ORR activity. This adaptive behavior mimics the conformational dynamics of an enzyme during the reaction, but retains the stability nature as a heterogeneous catalyst. The experiments validate that the as&#8208;designed catalyst with a characterized FeN4&#8208;Ten structure outperforms the commercial Pt/C catalyst both on activity and stability.

         <title>Integrating Bi@C Nanospheres in Porous Hard Carbon Frameworks for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D carbon framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres wrapped by a carbon layer (Bi@C&#8834;CFs) is synthesized via thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8722;organic framework nanorods. Due to this novel and unique architecture design, the hybrid electrode indicates superior electrochemical performance as an anode material for sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) have emerged as an alternative technology because of their merits in abundance and cost. Realizing their real applications, however, remains a formidable challenge. One is that among the limitations of anode materials, the alloy&#8208;type candidates tolerate fast capacity fading during cycling. Here, a 3D framework superstructure assembled with carbon nanobelt arrays decorated with a metallic bismuth (Bi) nanospheres coated carbon layer by thermolysis of Bi&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework nanorods is synthesized as an anode material for SIBs. Due to the unique structural superiority, the anode design promotes excellent sodium&#8208;storage performance in terms of high capacity, excellent cycling stability, and ultrahigh rate capability up to 80&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with a capacity of 308.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. The unprecedented sodium&#8208;storage ability is not only attributed to the unique hybrid architecture, but also to the production of a homogeneous and thin solid electrolyte interface layer and the formation of uniform porous nanostructures during cycling in the ether&#8208;based electrolyte. Importantly, deeper understanding of the underlying cause of the performance improvement is illuminated, which is vital to provide the theoretical basis for application of SIBs.

         <title>Fabrications of Topological Solitons Array in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, which occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and time scale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and time scale. Here, we find a way to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using the cholesteric LC confined in the patterned substrates. Our experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on free energy minimization closely reconstructs our experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Polarization Engineering of Covalent Triazine Frameworks for Highly Efficient Photosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide from Molecular Oxygen and Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Thio)urea&#8208;functionalized covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) are rationally designed, showing an outstanding photocatalytic activity toward production of H2O2 in water (3268.1 &#956;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with a quantum yield of 8.6% at 400 nm for the thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF) via reducing molecular oxygen (O2). This is much higher than most of the reported metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts in nonsacrificial systems.








Abstract
Two&#8208;electron oxygen photoreduction to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is seriously inhibited by its sluggish charge kinetics. Herein, a polarization engineering strategy is demonstrated by grafting (thio)urea functional groups onto covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs), giving rise to significantly promoted charge separation/transport and obviously enhanced proton transfer. The thiourea&#8208;functionalized CTF (Bpt&#8208;CTF) presents a substantial improvement in the photocatalytic H2O2 production rate to 3268.1&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 with no sacrificial agents or cocatalysts that is over an order of magnitude higher than unfunctionalized CTF (Dc&#8208;CTF), and a remarkable quantum efficiency of 8.6% at 400&#160;nm. Mechanistic studies reveal the photocatalytic performance is attributed to the prominently enhanced two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction by forming endoperoxide at the triazine unit and highly concentrated holes at the thiourea site. The generated O2 from water oxidation is subsequently consumed by the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), thereby boosting overall reaction kinetics. The findings suggest a powerful functional&#8208;groups&#8208;mediated polarization engineering method for the development of highly efficient metal&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based photocatalysts.

         <title>Assembly of AIEgen&#8208;Based Fluorescent Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanosheets and Seaweed Cellulose Nanofibrils for Humidity Sensing and UV&#8208;Shielding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs)&#8208;based composites, with strong fluorescence emission sensitive to relative humidity, are fabricated by integrating 4.0 wt% aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based 2D metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets in a water suspension. The composite films also show efficient UV&#8208;shielding capacity without compromise of the optical transmittance and excellent mechanical properties, owing to the metal&#8211;carboxylate coordination between the 2D MOF nanosheets and the CNFs.








Abstract
Integrating synthetic low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials such as metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) nanosheets with a sustainable biopolymer is a promising strategy to endow composites with attractive structural and functional properties for expanded applications. Herein, aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission luminogen (AIEgen)&#8208;based MOF bulk crystals are successfully exfoliated into ultrathin 2D nanosheets. Seaweed cellulose nanofibrils (CNFs) are assembled with low amounts (0.3 to 4.0&#160;wt%) of the 2D nanosheets to generate luminescent composites. The 2D nanosheets are adsorbed onto the CNFs in dilute water suspensions owing to the flexibility of the MOF nanosheets and the high aspect ratio of the CNFs. Transparent films are prepared by solution casting from a water suspension of the CNF&#8208;MOF assembly. The fluorescence emission of the composite films is enhanced because of the favored affinity between MOF nanosheets and CNFs. Remarkably, these films demonstrate excellent UV&#8208;shielding capacity and high optical transmittance at the visible wavelength range. The composite films also show reversible changes in fluorescence emission intensity in response to ambient humidity. The tensile strength and modulus of the composite films are also enhanced owing to the increased adhesion between CNFs through the adsorbed MOF nanosheets. This work provides a novel pathway to fabricate luminescent CNFs&#8208;based composites with tunable optical properties for functional materials.

         <title>Simultaneous One&#8208;Pot Interpenetrating Network Formation to Expand 3D Processing Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A one&#8208;pot photoinitiated reaction strategy is utilized to create tough interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels that are amenable to processing modalities such as Digital Light Processing based 3D printing and microfluidic fabrication of microparticles. The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.








Abstract
The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single&#8208;network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one&#8208;pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free&#8208;radical crosslinking of methacrylate&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene&#8208;modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low&#8208;viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.

The mechanical properties of these IPN hydrogels are highly tunable with optimal formulations exhibiting high toughness and low hysteresis despite the high water content.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The incorporation of a secondary network into traditional single-network hydrogels can enhance mechanical properties, such as toughness and loading to failure. These features are important for many applications, including as biomedical materials; however, the processing of interpenetrating polymer network (IPN) hydrogels is often limited by their multistep fabrication procedures. Here, a one-pot scheme for the synthesis of biopolymer IPN hydrogels mediated by the simultaneous crosslinking of two independent networks with light, namely: i) free-radical crosslinking of methacrylate-modified hyaluronic acid (HA) to form the primary network and ii) thiol&#8211;ene crosslinking of norbornene-modified HA with thiolated guest&#8211;host assemblies of adamantane and &#946;-cyclodextrin to form the secondary network, is reported. The mechanical properties of the IPN hydrogels are tuned by changing the network composition, with high water content (&#8776;94%) hydrogels exhibiting excellent work of fracture, tensile strength, and low hysteresis. As proof-of-concept, the IPN hydrogels are implemented as low-viscosity Digital Light Processing resins to fabricate complex structures that recover shape upon loading, as well as in microfluidic devices to form deformable microparticles. Further, the IPNs are cytocompatible with cell adhesion dependent on the inclusion of adhesive peptides. Overall, the enhanced processing of these IPN hydrogels will expand their utility across applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Achieving Ultrahigh&#8208;Rate Planar and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc Electroplating for Aqueous Zinc Battery Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zinc&#8208;metal anodes, which are desirable for various aqueous zinc battery chemistries, degrade over repeated cycling due to dendrite growth. It is found that dendrites can be prevented by ensuring no defective regions form during zinc deposition, thus removing sites for dendrite nucleation and ensuring purely planar deposition. This allows unprecedentedly high charging rates to be achieved.








Abstract
Despite being one of the most promising candidates for grid&#8208;level energy storage, practical aqueous zinc batteries are limited by dendrite formation, which leads to significantly compromised safety and cycling performance. In this study, by using single&#8208;crystal Zn&#8208;metal anodes, reversible electrodeposition of planar Zn with a high capacity of 8 mAh cm&#8722;2 can be achieved at an unprecedentedly high current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This dendrite&#8208;free electrode is well maintained even after prolonged cycling (&gt;1200 cycles at 50 mA cm&#8722;2). Such excellent electrochemical performance is due to single&#8208;crystal Zn suppressing the major sources of defect generation during electroplating and heavily favoring planar deposition morphologies. As so few defect sites form, including those that would normally be found along grain boundaries or to accommodate lattice mismatch, there is little opportunity for dendritic structures to nucleate, even under extreme plating rates. This scarcity of defects is in part due to perfect atomic&#8208;stitching between merging Zn islands, ensuring no defective shallow&#8208;angle grain boundaries are formed and thus removing a significant source of non&#8208;planar Zn nucleation. It is demonstrated that an ideal high&#8208;rate Zn anode should offer perfect lattice matching as this facilitates planar epitaxial Zn growth and minimizes the formation of any defective regions.

         <title>Confined Assembly of Colloidal Nanorod Superstructures by Locally Controlling Free&#8208;Volume Entropy in Nonequilibrium Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Confined assembly of colloidal nanorods is achieved by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy near the three&#8208;phase contact line and optimized self&#8208;assembly thermodynamic conditions. By designing the shape of liquid bridge, nanorod&#8208;superstructure microassembly arrays with long&#8208;range order and designable geometry are fabricated, including microwires, microrings, and orthogonal&#8208;oriented patterns, which exhibit programmable polarized fluorescence emission and polarization&#8208;dependent photoresponse.








Abstract
Long&#8208;range&#8208;ordered structures of nanoparticles with controllable orientation have advantages in applications toward sensors, photoelectric conversion, and field&#8208;effect transistors. The assembly process of nanorods in colloidal systems undergoes a nonequilibrium process from dispersion to aggregation. A variety of assembly methods such as solvent volatilization, electromagnetic field induction, and photoinduction are restricted to suppress local perturbations during the nonequilibrium concentration of nanoparticles, which are adverse to controlling the orientation and order of assembled structures. Here, a confined assembly method is reported by locally controlling free&#8208;volume entropy in nonequilibrium fluids to fabricate microstructure arrays based on colloidal nanorods with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order. The unique fluid dynamics of the liquid bridge is utilized to form a local region, where the free volume entropy reduction triggers assembly near the three&#8208;phase contact line (TPCL), allowing nanorods to assemble in 2D closest packing parallel to the TPCL for the maximum Gibbs free energy reduction. By manipulating the orientation of liquid flow, microstructures are assembled with programmable geometry, which sustains polarized photoluminescence and polarization&#8208;dependent photodetection. This confined assembly method opens up perspectives on assemblies of nanomaterials with controllable orientation and long&#8208;range order as a platform for multifunctional integrated devices.

         <title>Controlled Doping of Electrocatalysts through Engineering Impurities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of ab&#160;initio calculations and atom probe tomography is used to evidence and rationalize B&#8208;doping of Pd nanocatalysts. The doping level is adjusted by controlling the wet&#8208;chemical synthesis conditions, that is, chemical potential and kinetics. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, an influence of B&#8208;doping on the electrocatalytic behavior toward the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction in alkaline conditions is demonstrated.








Abstract
Fuel cells recombine water from H2 and O2 thereby can power, for example, cars or houses with no direct carbon emission. In anion&#8208;exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs), to reach high power densities, operating at high pH is an alternative to using large volumes of noble metals catalysts at the cathode, where the oxygen&#8208;reduction reaction occurs. However, the sluggish kinetics of the hydrogen&#8208;oxidation reaction (HOR) hinders upscaling despite promising catalysts. Here, the authors observe an unexpected ingress of B into Pd nanocatalysts synthesized by wet&#8208;chemistry, gaining control over this B&#8208;doping, and report on its influence on the HOR activity in alkaline conditions. They rationalize their findings using ab&#160;initio calculations of both H&#8208; and OH&#8208;adsorption on B&#8208;doped Pd. Using this &#8220;impurity engineering&#8221; approach, they thus design Pt&#8208;free catalysts as required in electrochemical energy conversion devices, for example, next generations of AEMFCs, that satisfy the economic and environmental constraints, that is, reasonable operating costs and long&#8208;term stability, to enable the &#8220;hydrogen economy.&#8221;

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;Activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedral nanobox, a kind of dynamic framework nucleic acid nanocarrier, is fabricated to completely encapsulate target siRNA and realize controllable delivery of cargo strands upon a pH&#8208;responsive switch. Based on the protective encapsulation against degradation and detachment during delivery and final active release in cells, excellent gene&#8208;silencing effects are achieved for in vitro and in vivo experiments.








Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox is fabricated for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) gene is achieved in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, the nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Printable and Highly Stretchable Viscoelastic Conductors with Kinematically Reconstructed Conductive Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretch&#8208;induced kinematic reorganization of Ag flakes in a viscoelastic polymer matrix can lead to spontaneous formation of new and efficient conductive pathways with enhanced conductivity, successfully addressing the conductivity&#8211;stretchability dilemma. This study establishes a fundamentally new approach to fabricate filler&#8208;reinforced stretchable conductors, paving the way for the future development of polymer composites for soft, stretchable electronics.








Abstract
Printable and stretchable conductors based on metallic&#8208;filler&#8208;reinforced polymer composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity at large strains are essential for emerging applications in wearable electronics, soft robotics, and bio&#8208;integrated devices. Regulating microstructures of conductive fillers during mechanical deformations is the key to reconstructing the conductive pathway and retaining high electrical conductivity, which has proven to be challenging. Here, it is reported that Ag flakes can spontaneously reorganize inside a viscoelastic, liquid&#8208;like polymer matrix by cyclic mechanical stretching, resulting in reconstructed microstructures and forming highly efficient and stable conductive pathways. Consequently, the electrical conductivities of the resultant composites can be dramatically enhanced by &#8776;4&#8211;8 orders of magnitude and reach &#8776;104 S cm&#8722;1. The stretch&#8208;induced kinematic movements of Ag flakes inside the polymer matrix, together with the reorganization and stabilization mechanisms, are unraveled and validated by the dissipative particle dynamics simulations. This unique phenomenon enables high&#8208;performance stretchable conductors to be fabricated with significantly reduced conductive fillers. The printable and stretchable composites presented here hold great promise for use in soft and stretchable electronics, as demonstrated in stretchable light&#8208;emitting diode arrays and wearable electronics.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Line&#8208;Guided Growth of Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Slip lines on metal surfaces are found to play a pivotal role in determining the orientation of graphene. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the orientation of graphene grown on a variety of metal facets, further enabling the controllable synthesis of single&#8208;crystal graphene and grain&#8208;boundary engineering of bicrystal graphene on designed metal facets.








Abstract
Manipulating the crystal orientation of emerging 2D materials via chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is a key premise for obtaining single&#8208;crystalline films and designing specific grain&#8208;boundary (GB) structures. Herein, the controllable crystal orientation of graphene during the CVD process is demonstrated on a single&#8208;crystal metal surface with preexisting atomic&#8208;scale stair steps resulting from dislocation slip lines. The slip&#8208;line&#8208;guided growth principle is established to explain and predict the crystal orientation distribution of graphene on a variety of metal facets, especially for the multidirectional growth cases on Cu(hk0) and Cu(hkl) substrates. Not only large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal graphene, but also bicrystal graphene with controllable GB misorientations, are successfully synthesized by rationally employing tailored metal substrate facets. As a demonstration, bicrystal graphenes with misorientations of &#8776;21&#176; and &#8776;11&#176; are constructed on Cu(410) and Cu(430) foils, respectively. This guideline builds a bridge linking the crystal orientation of graphene and the substrate facet, thereby opening a new avenue for constructing bicrystals with the desired GB structures or manipulating 2D superlattice twist angles in a bottom&#8208;up manner.

         <title>Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase In&#8208;situ Formed on Magnesium Metal Anode by Using a Perfluorinated Alkoxide&#8208;based All&#8208;magnesium Salt Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Passivation of Mg anode surface in conventional electrolytes composes a critical issue for practical Mg batteries. In this work, a perfluorinated tert&#8208;butoxide magnesium salt, Mg(pftb)2, is co&#8208;dissolved with MgCl2 in tetrahydrofuran (THF) to form an all&#8208;magnesium salt electrolyte. Raman spectroscopy and density function theory calculation confirm that [Mg2Cl3&#183;6THF]+[Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; is the main electrochemically active species of the electrolyte. The proper lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of the [Mg(pftb)3]&#8211; anion enables in&#8208;situ formation of a stable a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on Mg anodes. A detailed analysis of the SEI reveals that its stability originates from a dual&#8208;layered organic/inorganic hybrid structure. Mg//Cu and Mg//Mg cells using the electrolyte achieve a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.7% over 3000 cycles, and low overpotentials over ultralong&#8208;cycle lives of 8100, 3000, and 1500 h at current densities of 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, respectively. The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side&#8208;reactions in a TFSI&#8211;&#8208;containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo6S8 full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.

The robust SEI layer, once formed on a Mg electrode, is also shown highly effective in suppressing side-reactions in a TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt;-containing electrolyte. A high Coulombic efficiency of 99.5% over 800 cycles is also demonstrated for a Mg//Mo&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; full cell, showing great promise of the SEI forming electrolyte in future Mg batteries.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Elastic Lattice Enabling Reversible Tetrahedral Li Storage Sites in High&#8208;Capacity Manganese Oxide Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The key to breaking through the capacity limitation imposed by intercalating chemistry lies in the ability to harness more active sites that can reversibly accommodate more ions (e.g., Li+) and electrons within a finite space. However, excessive Li&#8208;ion insertion into Li layer of layered cathodes result in fast performance decay due to the huge lattice change and irreversible phase transformation. In this study, an ultra&#8208;high reversible capacity is demonstrated by a layered oxide cathode purely based on manganese. Through a wealth of characterizations, it is clarified that the presence of low&#8208;content Li2MnO3 domains not only reduces the amount of irreversible O loss; but also regulates Mn migration in LiMnO2 domains, enabling elastic lattice with high reversibility for tetrahedral sites Li&#8208;ion storage in Li layers. Our work utilizs bulk cation disorder to create stable Li&#8208;ions storage tetrahedral sites and elastic lattice for layered materials, with a reversible capacity of 600&#160;mA h g&#8211;1 demonstrated in 0.6&#8208; 4.9&#160;V versus Li/Li+ at 10&#160;mA g&#8211;1. Admittedly, discharging to 0.6&#160;V might be too low for practical use, this exploration is still of great importance as it conceptually demonstrates the limit of Li&#8208;ions insertion into layered oxide materials.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>2D&#8208;Topology&#8208;Seeded Graphitization for Highly Thermally Conductive Carbon Fibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization strategy effectively generates a new species of highly thermally conductive carbon fibers. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude more conductive than commercial PAN&#8208;based carbon fibers. These fibers have great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials, high&#8208;power electronics, and energy storage.








Abstract
Highly thermally conductive carbon fibers (CFs) have become an important material to meet the increasing demand for efficient heat dissipation. To date, high thermal conductivity has been only achieved in specific pitch&#8208;based CFs with high crystallinity. However, obtaining high graphitic crystallinity and high thermal conductivity beyond pitch&#8208;CFs remains a grand challenge. Here, a 2D&#8208;topology&#8208;seeded graphitization method is presented to mediate the topological incompatibility in graphitization by seeding 2D graphene oxide (GO) sheets into the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) precursor. Strong mechanical strength and high thermal conductivity up to 850 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 are simultaneously realized, which are one order of magnitude higher in conductivity than commercial PAN&#8208;based CFs. The self&#8208;oxidation and seeded graphitization effect generate large crystallite size and high orientation to far exceed those of conventional CFs. Topologically seeded graphitization, verified in experiments and simulations, allows conversion of the non&#8208;graphitizable into graphitizable materials by incorporating 2D seeds. This method extends the preparation of highly thermally conductive CFs, which has great potential for lightweight thermal&#8208;management materials.

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

The MOF-driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex-solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark-level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone-sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex-solution process rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Highly Selective Adsorption of Perfluorinated Greenhouse Gases by Porous Organic Cages</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Anthropogenic greenhouse gases contribute to global warming. Among those gases, perfluorocarbons (PFCs) are thousands to tens of thousands times more harmful to the environment than comparable amounts of carbon dioxide. Till date, materials that selectively adsorb perfluorocarbons in favor to other less harmful gases have not been reported. Here a series of porous organic cage compounds with alkyl&#8208;, fluoroalkyl&#8208;, and partially fluorinated alkyl groups is presented. Their isomorphic crystalline states allowed us to study the property&#8208;relationship of the degree of fluorination of the alkyl chains on gas sorption properties for PFCs and their selective uptakes in comparison to other, non&#8208;fluorinated gases. By this approach, one compound was identified, having superior selectivities of PFCs versus N2 or CO2 under ambient conditions.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Stiffening of Shape&#8208;Memory Polyurethanes Composed of Hard Backbone Dangling PEG Soft Segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermally triggered phase transformation process and &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; achieved by lattice distortion of shape&#8208;memory alloys, a series of water&#8208;triggered stiffening shape&#8208;memory polyurethane are developed. They can achieve &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition by forming more continuous hard domains upon hydration.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Young's modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, the principle of phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape&#8208;memory metallic alloys (SMAs) is introduced to the design of molecular structures for shape&#8208;memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all&#8208;hard segments composed of main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieve a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovers. The stiffening process is driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and the soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation is enhanced and the hard domains are transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitates the shape&#8208;recovery process in the hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature (Tg). This work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape&#8208;memory property, and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from a BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on a Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, is reported, which integrates the nerve regenerative potential of microRNA&#8208;22 and tFNAs to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by improving the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages. MiDs can rapidly initiate the repair procedures of SCs and facilitate the polarization of macrophages into M2 macrophages to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, an innovative approach is adopted to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, which can integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrate that MiDs can amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs can initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

         <title>Structural Regulation of Coupled Phthalocyanine&#8208;Porphyrin Covalent Organic Frameworks to Highly Active and Selective Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have been applied as potential electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) due to their adjustable architecture and porous feature. Herein, tetraanhydrides of 2,3,9,10,16,17,23,24&#8208;octacarboxyphthalocyanine cobalt(II) (CoTAPc) is used as node to couple with 5,15&#8208;di(4&#8208;aminophenyl)&#8208;10,20&#8208;diphenylporphyrin (DAPor) or 5,15,10,20&#8208;tetrayl(4&#8208;aminophenyl)porphyrin (TAPor) via imidization reaction to fabricate novel coupled phthalocyanine&#8208;porphyrin Type 1:2 (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) or Type 1:1 (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) COFs for the first time. Electrocatalytic CO2RR experiments show that both Type 1:2 and Type 1:1 COFs exhibit the maximum Faraday efficiency over 90% with high stability, while Type 1:2 COF (CoPc&#8208;2H2Por) delivers lower overpotential, higher current density and CO selectivity than Type 1:1 COF (CoPc&#8208;H2Por) and CoPc monomer. Theoretical and experimental results reveal that the better CO2RR activity of CoPc&#8208;2H2Por than CoPc&#8208;H2Por can be attributed to its larger pore size and conjugate structure, which then cause more efficient electron transfer, adsorption/activation of CO2, faster mass transfer and reaction kinetics. This work provides a new idea in the structural design of COF&#8208;based electrocatalyst for efficient CO2RR.

         <title>All&#8208;Organic Self&#8208;Powered Photodetector with Ultra&#8208;Flexible Dual&#8208;Polarity Output for Bio&#8208;Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Endowing photodetectors with mechanically flexibility and actual functionality are current research issues in developing optoelectronic devices. However, rigid metal&#8208;based or metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based electrodes remain a block to the realization of ultra&#8208;flexible electronics. Thus, we design an ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;organic photodetectors (all&#8208;OPD) by innovatively introducing symmetrical organic electrodes PH1000/PH1000 to substitute the widely applied ITO/Ag electrodes. Specifically, this all&#8208;OPD exhibits a high self&#8208;powered responsivity (R) of over 100&#160;mA/W among 500&#8211;600&#160;nm and the photocurrent remains about 80% of the original performance after being bent 20000 circles, which can output steady bio&#8208;signals for photoplethysmography (PPG) application. More importantly, this all&#8208;OPD outputs dual&#8208;polarity photocurrent as it is flipped or folded. Benefitting from the ordered phase distribution and designed Schottky barrier heights, the photogenerated holes will be transferred and collected by nearer electrode, while electrons will be trapped in the thick bulk heterojunction (BHJ) as a result of the long channel. Our work offers a new avenue towards developing a multifunctional and ultra&#8208;flexible all&#8208;OPD with a straightforward all&#8208;solution method, and it is expected to be more compatible in complex application scenarios.

         <title>Blading of Conformal Electron Transport Layers in p&#8208;i&#8208;n Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising to reduce the cost of photovoltaic system due to their low&#8208;cost raw materials and high&#8208;throughput solution process, however it has not been demonstrated yet to fabricate all the active layers in perovskite modules using scalable solution process. Herein, we report the fabrication of highly efficient PSCs and modules in ambient conditions with all layers bladed except the metal electrode by overcoming the challenges of blading of 36&#177;9&#160;nm&#160;thick electron transport layer (ETL) on perovskite films with a roughness of &#8764;80&#160;nm. A combination of additives in phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM) allows PCBM to conformally cover perovskites and still have a good electrical conductivity. Amine functionalized molecules are added to enhance both the dispersity of PCBM molecules and the affinity to perovskites. A PCBM dopant of 4&#8208;(2,3&#8208;Dihydro&#8208;1,3&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;1H&#8208;benzimidazol&#8208;2&#8208;yl)&#8208;N,N&#8208;dimethylbenzenamine (N&#8208;DMBI) recovers the conductivity loss induced by small amine functionalized molecules. Perovskite solar cells (0.08 cm2) fabricated by all blading process have reached an average efficiency of &#8764;22.4&#177;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL solar cells. The all&#8208;bladed minimodule with an area of 25.03 cm2 shows an aperture efficiency of &#8764;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.

Perovskite solar cells (0.08 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) fabricated by all blading process have reached an average efficiency of &#8764;22.4&#177;0.5%&#160;and a champion efficiency of 23.1% for perovskites with a bandgap of 1.51&#160;eV, with much better stability compared to evaporated ETL solar cells. The all-bladed minimodule with an area of 25.03 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; shows an aperture efficiency of &#8764;19.3%, showing the good uniformity of the bladed ETLs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion&#8208; or surface&#8208;controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolytes: Underexplored Materials for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality is assessed. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds.

&lt;p&gt;The bulk conductivity of naphthalene-diimide-based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n-doping with cobaltocene. Following single-electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping-mechanism.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well-defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)-containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n-doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as-prepared NDI-containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub-2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge-carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron-spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI-radical anions. While the native NDI-based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;S&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n-doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out-of-plane (&#960;-stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross-plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well-defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n-type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of Free&#8208;Standing Flexible 2D Intercalated Nanofilm Uniform over Tens of cm2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported. The film can be laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The film is uniform over an area of 30 cm2, and shows electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending and proton conductivity up to 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Of a variety of intercalated materials, 2D intercalated systems have attracted much attention both as materials per se, and as a platform to study atoms and molecules confined among nanometric layers. High&#8208;precision fabrication of such structures has, however, been a difficult task using the conventional top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported here. The two&#8208;layered film can be further laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The 3 nm film forms uniformly over an area of several tens of cm2 at an air/water interface and can be transferred to either flat or perforated substrates. A free&#8208;standing film in air prepared by transfer to a gold comb electrode shows proton conductivity up to 1.4&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. Electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending of a free&#8208;standing 6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm hung in a vacuum is observed under electron beam irradiation.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

         <title>Organic Semiconductor Crystal Engineering for High&#8208;Resolution Layer&#8208;Controlled 2D Crystal Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution (1271 dpi), and layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.








Abstract
2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large&#8208;area and high&#8208;throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high&#8208;resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate&#8208; and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high&#8208;resolution and controllable molecular&#8208;layer numbers through solution&#8208;based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;step strategy to produce high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large&#8208;scale 2DOSCs with well&#8208;defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays&#8208;based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility.

&lt;p&gt;Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)-mold-assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large-area, high-resolution (1271 dpi), and layer-controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next-generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large-area and high-throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high-resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate- and template-assisted self-assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high-resolution and controllable molecular-layer numbers through solution-based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two-step strategy to produce high-resolution layer-controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large-scale 2DOSCs with well-defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution-processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high-resolution layer-controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold-assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field-effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6-bis(4-hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays-based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility. This strategy can be applied to various organic semiconductors and pattern arrays. These demonstrations will offer more opportunities for 2DOSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable All&#8208;Fluorescent White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a High External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% and Extended Device Lifetime</title>

Color&#8208;tunable white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with hole&#8208;trapping thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.








Abstract
White organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer device architecture capable of hole&#8208;trapping TADF&#8208;sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll&#8208;off. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This is the first time that all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

Conformal Films
In article number 2106683, Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a variety of ultrathin, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics that differ in layout, active area, and active material can be laminated to glass spheres of different sizes using a thermally activated shrink film. The wrinkling pattern that occurs in these ultrathin sheets allows even nonstretchable devices to conform to surfaces with a 3D curvature.

Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors
High&#8208;performance polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors with a linear dichroic ratio as high as 1.9 are successfully developed by Huanli Dong, Zhongming Wei, Liqiang Li, Wenping Hu, and co&#8208;workers, as described in article number 2105665, utilizing the intrinsic anisotropic nature of organic semiconductor single crystals. These devices show new opportunities for using organic semiconductors to develop highly compact polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors in diverse applications, and open up a new area for the study of organic semiconductors.

         <title>Controlled Growth and Self&#8208;Assembly of Multiscale Organic Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>

Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.

Abstract
Traditional electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), due to the lack of human brain&#8208;like thinking and judging capability, is powerless to accelerate the pace to the intelligent era. Herein, we propose an AI&#8208;motivated full&#8208;skin bionic (FSB) e&#8208;skin consisting of the structures of human vellus hair, epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis. Benefiting from the double interlocked layered microcone structure and supercapacitive iontronic effect, the FSB e&#8208;skin exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity of 8053.1 kPa&#8722;1 (&lt;1&#160;kPa), linear sensitivity of 3103.5 kPa&#8722;1 (1&#8208;34&#160;kPa), fast response/recovery time (&lt;5.6&#160;ms) and limit of detection (0.05&#160;Pa). In addition, it is also demonstrated it can realize the evolution from tactile perception to advanced intelligent tactile cognition after being equipped with a &#8220;brain&#8221;. Firstly, static/dynamic contactless tactile perception is achieved based on the triboelectric effect of the vellus hair bionics. Secondly, the supercapacitive iontronic effect based structural bionics of the epidermis&#8208;dermis&#8208;hypodermis and a 5&#8208;layer multilayer perception (MLP) enable the general intelligent tactile cognition of gesture cognition and robot interaction. Most importantly, by making full use of FSB e&#8208;skin with a 6&#8208;layer MLP neural network, we develop an advanced intelligent material cognition system for real&#8208;time cognition of the object material species and locations via one contact, which surpasses the capability of humans.

         <title>Diammonium mediated perovskite film formation for high&#8208;luminescence red perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) mixed halide perovskite&#8208;based red emitters combine excellent charge transport characteristics with simple solution processing and good film formation; however, light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on these emitters cannot yet outperform their nanocrystal counterparts. Here we explored the use of diammonium halides in regulating the formation of mixed bromide&#8208;iodide perovskite films. We found that the diammonium cations preferentially bond to Pb&#8208;Br, rather than Pb&#8208;I, octahedra, promoting the formation of quasi&#8208;2D phases. We propose that the perovskite formation is initially dominated by the crystallization of the thermodynamically more favorable 3D phase, but, as the solution gets depleted from the regular A cations, thin shells of amorphous quasi&#8208;2D perovskites form. This leads to crystalline perovskite grains with efficiently passivated surfaces and reduced lattice strain. As a result, the diammonium treated perovskite LEDs demonstrate a record luminance (10745&#160;cd m&#8211;2) and half&#8208;lifetime among 3D perovskite&#8208;based red LEDs.

         <title>Designing rewritable dual&#8208;mode patterns using a stretchable photoresponsive polymer via orthogonal photopatterning</title>

Abstract
The fabrication of dual&#8208;mode patterns in the same region of a material is a promising approach for high&#8208;density information storage, new anti&#8208;counterfeiting technologies, and highly secure encryption. However, dual&#8208;mode patterns are difficult to achieve because the two patterns in one material may interfere with each other during fabrication and usage. The development of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns requires new materials and patterning techniques. Herein, a novel orthogonal photopatterning technique is reported for the fabrication of non&#8208;interfering dual&#8208;mode patterns on an azopolymer P1. P1 is a unique material that exhibits both photo&#8208;induced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions and good stretchability. In the first step of orthogonal photopatterning, patterned photonic structures are fabricated on a P1 film via masked nanoimprinting controlled by photoinduced reversible solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid transitions. In the second step, the P1 film is stretched and irradiated with polarized light through a photomask, which generates a chromatic polarization pattern. In particular, the photonic structures and chromatic polarization in the dual&#8208;mode pattern are noninterfering. Another feature of dual&#8208;mode patterns is that they are rewritable via photo, thermal, or solution reprocessing, which are useful for recycling and reprogramming. Our study opens an avenue for the development of novel materials and techniques for photopatterning.

         <title>Electrochemical Construction of Edge&#8208;Contacted Metal&#8208;Semiconductor Junctions with Low Contact Barrier</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 have emerged as promising ultrathin channel materials for the further scaling of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs). However, the contact barrier at the metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions still significantly limits the device performance. By extending the application of electrochemical deposition in 2D electronics, we developed a distinct approach for constructing metal&#8208;2D semiconductor junctions in an edge&#8208;contacted configuration through the edge guided electrodeposition of varied metals. Both high resolution microscopic imaging and electrical transport measurements confirmed the successful creation of high quality Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions in desired geometry by combining electrodepostion with lithographic patterning. We further fabricated FETs on the obtained Pd&#8208;2D MoS2 junctions and confirmed that these junctions exhibited reduced contact barrier of &#8764;20 meV and extremely low contact resistance of 290 &#937;&#183;&#956;m and thus increased the averaged mobility of MoS2 FETs to &#8764;108 cm2V&#8211;1s&#8211;1. Our approach paves a new way for the construction of metal&#8208;semiconductor junctions and also demonstrates the great potential of electrochemical deposition technique in 2D electronics.

         <title>Cell&#8208;in&#8208;Catalytic&#8208;Shell Nanoarchitectonics: Catalytic Empowerment of Individual Living Cells by Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, up to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with supramolecular metal&#8208;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids, and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. Our system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;driven Self&#8208;healing of Metal Oxides Assisted By Polymer&#8208;inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here we have developed a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein we demonstrate that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials has been expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. We revealed that electrical properties of ITO can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Single&#8208;Layer&#8208;Particle Electrode Design for Practical Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efforts to enable fast charging and high energy density lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are hampered by the trade&#8208;off nature of the traditional electrode design: increasing the areal capacity usually comes with sacrificing the fast charge transfer. Here we report a single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design, where red phosphorus active material is embedded in nanochannels of vertically aligned graphene (red P/VAG) assemblies. Such electrode design addresses the sluggish charge transfer stemming from the high tortuosity and inner particle/electrode resistance of traditional electrode architectures consisting of randomly stacked active particles. The vertical ion transport nanochannels and electron transfer conductive nanowalls of graphene confine the direction of charge transfer to minimize the transfer distance, and the incomplete filling of nanochannels in the red P/VAG composite buffers volume change locally, thus avoiding the variation of electrodes thickness during cycling. The single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode displays a high areal capacity (5.6 mAh cm&#8211;2), which was the highest among the reported fast&#8208;charging battery chemistries. Paired with a high&#8208;loading LiNi0.6Co0.2Mn0.2O2 (NCM622) cathode, a pouch cell showed stable cycling with high energy density (405&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, 1040&#160;Wh L&#8211;1), and power density (1224 W kg&#8211;1 and 3137 W L&#8211;1 at 6 C, 30&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). Such single&#8208;layer chunky particle electrode design with inner vertical charge transport pathways can be extended to other advanced battery systems and boost the development of LIBs with fast&#8208;charging capability and high energy density.

Traditional alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AC&#8208;EL) devices adopting a sandwich structure are commonly used in solid&#8208;state lighting and displays, while the emerging coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven light&#8208;emitting variants manifest excellent application prospects in intelligent, multifunctional and full&#8208;color displays, and sensing purposes. Here, an asymmetrically&#8208;enhanced coplanar&#8208;electrode alternating&#8208;current&#8208;driven electroluminescent (AECE AC&#8208;EL) device with a universal and straightforward architecture is designed based on the impedance adjustment strategy. This newly devised asymmetric structure extends the functionalities of the coplanar&#8208;electrode AC&#8208;EL devices by overcoming the bottlenecks of complicated patterning procedures and high driving voltages of symmetric configuration. The developed device design enables a new type of information encryption and ultra&#8208;high stretchable patterned displays. Notably, the novel encryption appliances demonstrate feasible encryption/decryption features, multiple encryptions, and practical applicability; the biaxially&#8208;stretchable display devices achieve the highest tensile performance in the field of stretchable electroluminescent pattern displays, and outperforms the ultrahigh stretchable sandwich devices in terms of simple patterning process, higher brightness, wider color gamut and long&#8208;term stability. The proposed configuration opens up new avenues for AC&#8208;EL devices towards a plethora of smart applications in wearable electronics with intelligent displays, dynamic interaction of human&#8208;machine interface, and soft robotics.

         <title>Highly Curved, Quasi&#8208;Single&#8208;Crystalline Mesoporous Metal Nanoplates Promote C&#8212;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
The ability to manipulate metal nanocrystals with well&#8208;defined morphologies and structures is greatly important in material chemistry, catalysis chemistry, nanoscience and nanotechnology. Although two&#8208;dimensional (2D) metals serve as interesting platforms, further manipulating them in solution with highly penetrated mesopores and ideal crystallinity remains a huge challenge. Here, we report an easy yet powerful synthesis strategy to manipulating mesoporous structure and crystallinity of 2D metals in a controlled manner with cetyltrimethylammonium chloride as the mesopore&#8208;forming surfactant and extra iodine ion as the structure/facet&#8208;selective agent. This strategy allows for preparing an unprecedented type of 2D quasi&#8208;single&#8208;crystalline mesoporous nanoplates (SMPs) with highly curved morphology and controlled metal composition. The products, for example PdCu SMPs, feature abundant undercoordinated sites, optimized electronic structures, excellent electron/mass transfers, and confined mesopore environments. Curved PdCu SMPs exhibit remarkable electrocatalytic activity of 6.09 A mgPd&#8722;1 and stability for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) compared with its counterpart catalysts and commercial Pd/C. More importantly, PdCu SMPs are highly selective for EOR electrocatalysis that dramatically promotes the C&#8212;C bond cleavage with a superior C1 pathway selectivity as high as 72.1%. The findings in this work may put forward new insight into producing a new family of 2D and/or mesoporous metals with fascinating physicochemical properties for various targeted applications.

         <title>Biaxially Compressive Strain in Ni/Ru Core/Shell Nanoplates Boosts Li&#8208;CO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in the rechargeable Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8764;5.1% and &#8764;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8208;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8208;CO2 batteries. We demonstrate that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8211;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8211;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. Our study confirms that strain engineering though constructing the well&#8208;defined core/shell structure is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8208;CO2 batteries.

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited to mostly antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here we report a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform enabling screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, &#945;&#8208;Man, &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc, and &#946;&#8208;GalNAc) was converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). We systematically screened and identified GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors. The cypate&#8208;conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;&#8208;Man and &#946;&#8208;GlcNAc showed selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel&#8208;contained GlyNP displaying &#946;&#8208;Glc, &#946;&#8208;Gal, and &#945;&#8208;Man demonstrated targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrated that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer&#8208;targeting glyconanoparticles and suggested its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Driven Auto&#8208;Detachable Patterning of Flexible Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multi&#8208;material and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, we report a SHrinkage&#8208;Assisted Patterning by Evaporation (SHAPE) method, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong inter&#8208;layer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless microsupercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functioned stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>Nanochitin and Nanochitosan: Chitin Nanostructure Engineering with Multiscale Properties for Biomedical and Environmental Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanochitin and nanochitosan (with random copolymer&#8208;based multiscale architectures of glucosamine and N&#8208;acetylglucosamine units) have recently attracted immense attention for the development of green, sustainable, and advanced functional materials. Nanochitin and nanochitosan are multiscale materials from small oligomers, rod&#8208;shaped nanocrystals, longer nanofibers, to hierarchical assemblies of nanofibers. Various physical properties of chitin and chitosan depend on their molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;structures; translational research has utilized them for a wide range of applications (biomedical, industrial, environmental, and so on). Instead of reviewing the entire extensive literature on chitin and chitosan, this paper highlights recent developments in multiscale&#8208;dependent material properties and their applications; immune, medical, reinforcing, adhesive, green electrochemical materials, biological scaffolds, and sustainable food packaging have been discussed considering the size, shape, and assembly of chitin nanostructures. In summary, new perspectives for the development of sustainable advanced functional materials based on nanochitin and nanochitosan by understanding and engineering their multiscale properties are described.

         <title>Metasurface&#8208;Enhanced Infrared Spectroscopy: An Abundance of Materials and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Infrared (IR) spectroscopy provides unique information on the composition and dynamics of biochemical systems by resolving the characteristic absorption fingerprints of their constituent molecules. Based on this inherent chemical specificity and the capability for label&#8208;free, non&#8208;invasive, and real&#8208;time detection, IR spectroscopy approaches have unlocked a plethora of breakthrough application perspectives for fields ranging from environmental monitoring and defense to chemical analysis and medical diagnostics. Nanophotonics has played a crucial role for pushing the sensitivity limits of traditional far&#8208;field spectroscopy by using resonant nanostructures to focus the incident light into nanoscale hot&#8208;spots of the electromagnetic field, greatly enhancing light&#8208;matter interaction. Metasurfaces composed of regular arrangements of such resonators further increase the design space for tailoring this nanoscale light control both spectrally and spatially, which has established them as an invaluable toolkit for surface&#8208;enhanced spectroscopy. Starting from the fundamental concepts of metasurface&#8208;enhanced IR spectroscopy, we showcase a broad palette of resonator geometries, materials and arrangements for realizing highly sensitive metadevices, with a special focus on emerging systems such as phononic and 2D van der Waals materials, and integration with waveguides for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, we will highlight some advanced sensor functionalities of metasurface&#8208;based IR spectroscopy, including multiresonance, tunability, dielectrophoresis, live cell sensing, and machine&#8208;learning&#8208;aided analysis.

         <title>Carrier Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, we use operando photoemission electron microscopy to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during the transistor operation. Notably, we observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer showed that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by approximately 80%. Our technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

         <title>Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extreme strain induced by nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Graphene is known as a super&#8208;stiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, we report the Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool. Nanoindentation was performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light was focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signal of the G and 2D bands of graphene was redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. Our measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under super&#8208;high strain.

         <title>Semi&#8208;immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics towards Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries have been extensively investigated as next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries due to their advantages including high theoretical capacity, reliable safety, environment friendly, and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of zinc ion batteries. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode in a wide temperature range from &#8208;35&#176;C to 60&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition, the free anions of ILs can weaken hydrogen bonds of water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries has been greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800 h at 20&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000 h under a wide temperature window from &#8208;35&#176;C&#8764;60&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy has been well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20 A g&#8211;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80000 cycles. This work provides a new platform for constructing stable Zn anode and high&#8208;performance zinc ion batteries.

         <title>Ultrafast sintering for ceramic&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Long processing time and high temperatures are often required in sintering ceramic electrolytes, which lead to volatile element loss and high cost. Here, we report an ultrafast sintering method of microwave&#8208;induced carbothermal shock to fabricate various ceramic electrolytes in seconds. Furthermore, it is also able to integrate electrode and electrolyte in one step by simultaneous co&#8208;sintering. Based on this ultrafast co&#8208;sintering technique, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal battery with a high areal capacity is successfully achieved, realizing a promising electrochemical performance at room temperature. This method can extend to other various ceramic multilayer based solid devices.

         <title>Recent progress of metal sulfide photocatalysts for solar energy conversion</title>

Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. In this review, we describe how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, we highlight the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides and envision future development trends in photocatalysis.

         <title>Revealing the Structural Coloration of Self&#8208;Assembled Chitin Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The structural coloration of arthropods often arises from helicoidal structures made primarily of chitin. Although it is possible to achieve analogous helicoidal architectures by exploiting the self&#8208;assembly of chitin nanocrystals (ChNCs), to date no evidence of structural coloration has been reported from such structures. In this work, we identify that previous studies were constrained by both the experimental inability to access sub&#8208;micron helicoidal pitches and the intrinsically low birefringence of crystalline chitin. To expand the range of accessible pitches, here we isolate ChNCs from two phylogenetically distinct sources of &#945;&#8208;chitin, namely fungi and shrimp, while to increase the birefringence, we perform an in situ alkaline treatment, increasing the intensity of the reflected color by nearly two orders of magnitude. By combining this treatment with precise control over suspension formulation, we demonstrate structurally colored chitin&#8208;based films with reflection tunable from blue to near infrared.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>

Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel were fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor was integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS have provided a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

Abstract
Riding on the rapid growth in electric vehicles and the stationary energy storage market, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries and next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries (i.e., advanced batteries) have been long&#8208;accepted as essential building blocks for future technology reaching the specific energy density of 400&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at the cell&#8208;level. Such progress, mainly driven by the emerging electrode materials or electrolytes, necessitates the development of polymeric materials with advanced functionalities in the battery to address new challenges. Therefore, it is urgently required to understand the basic chemistry and essential research directions in polymeric materials and establish a library for the polymeric materials that enables the development of advanced batteries. Herein, based on indispensable polymeric materials in advanced high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion, lithium&#8208;sulfur, lithium metal, and dual&#8208;ion battery chemistry, the key research directions of polymeric materials for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety are summarized and design strategies for further improving performance are examined. Furthermore, the challenges of polymeric materials for advanced battery technologies are discussed.

Abstract
Phase change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8208;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8208;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention towards practical thermal energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, we aim to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8208;solid PCMs suitable for thermal energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. We start by presenting developing strategies of solid&#8208;solid PCMs and then discuss the structure&#8208;property relationship followed by potential applications. We finish by presenting an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions. We hope our efforts will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic and mechanical applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, it is still a grand challenge to achieve single&#8208;phase MEAAs using current synthetic methods. Herein, we report a general strategy for the preparation of ultralight three&#8208;dimensional (3D) porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3&#160;mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials and a very high porosity of 99.5% through combining the auto&#8208;combustion method and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 towards methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In&#8208;situ Fourier transform infrared and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies reveal that the highly selective CO2&#8208;emission&#8208;free conversion of methanol to formate over MEAA catalysts. We also demonstrate that the methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 173&#160;mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, and obtain value&#8208;added formate at anode to realize the sustainable H2 generation at cathode. This work lays the foundation for the design of advanced 3D MEAAs and broadens the electrocatalytic application of multimetallic MEAAs.

This work lays the foundation for the design of advanced 3D MEAAs and broadens the electrocatalytic application of multimetallic MEAAs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked of Multilayer and Weakly Bond Lowering Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling of lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding and lattice dynamics. Herein, we demonstrated a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inversed GaSe4 layers (g&#8217;), closed&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c&#8217;) along the c axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding arrange in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endue it a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity of 0.79 W/m/K at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W/m/K), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W/m/K), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W/m/K) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, also shed useful light on future design of low lattice thermal conductivity solids.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with adaptive adhesion and stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, we demonstrate a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8208;liquid stability and adhesion when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, we imaged the liquid impalement dynamics in three dimensions by confocal microscope and measured the stability and superhydrophobicity in varied systems. We envision our design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability could stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy (PTT) agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but &#8764;5 times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>Interface Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials. Here we report a facile approach to transform a RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by Mo&#8208;irradiation doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, we unveil a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating Mo irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device could achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. Our findings manifest the potential for modulating resistive switching in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Morphology Tuned Pt3Ge Accelerates Water Dissociation to Industrial Standard Hydrogen Production over a wide pH Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. We introduce a novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 mA/cm2 and 200 mA/cm2 current density, respectively in 0.5M H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15,000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA/cm2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displayed low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA/cm2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA/cm2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites and charge transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in&#8208;situ infrared spectroscopy and in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>The Non&#8208;Classical Crystallization Mechanism of a Composite Biogenic Guanine Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spectacular colors and visual phenomena in animals are produced by light interference from highly reflective guanine crystals. Little is known about how organisms regulate crystal morphology to tune the optics of these systems. By following guanine crystal formation in developing spiders, we elucidate a crystallization mechanism. Guanine crystallization is a &#8220;non&#8208;classical&#8221;, multi&#8208;step process involving a progressive ordering of states. Crystallization begins with nucleation of partially ordered nanogranules from a disordered precursor phase. Growth proceeds by orientated attachment of the nanogranules into platelets which coalesce into single crystals, via progressive relaxation of structural defects. Despite their prismatic morphology, the platelet texture is retained in the final crystals, which are composites of crystal lamellae and interlamellar sheets. Interactions between the macromolecular sheets and the planar face of guanine appear to direct nucleation, favoring platelet formation. These findings provide insights on how organisms control the morphology and optical properties of molecular crystals.

         <title>Fabrication of Bragg Mirrors by Multilayer Inkjet Printing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bragg mirrors are widely applied in optical and photonic devices due to their capability of light management. However, the fabrication of Bragg mirrors is mainly accomplished by physical and chemical vapor deposition processes, which are costly and do not allow for lateral patterning. We here report for the first time the fabrication of Bragg mirrors by fully inkjet printing. The photonic bandgap of Bragg mirrors is tailored by adjusting the number of bilayers in the stack and the layer thickness via simply varying printing parameters. An ultra&#8208;high reflectance of 99% is achieved with the devices consisting of ten bilayers only, and the central wavelength of Bragg mirrors is tuned from visible into near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Inkjet printing allows for fabricating Bragg mirrors on various substrates (e.g., glass and foils), in different sizes and variable lateral patterns. The printed Bragg mirrors not only exhibit a high reflection at designed wavelengths but also show an outstanding homogeneity in color over a large area. Our approach thus enables additive manufacturing for various applications ranging from microscale photonic elements to enhanced functionality and aesthetics in large&#8208;area displays and solar technologies.

         <title>Circuit Level Memory Technologies and Applications based on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances, low power consumption as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices in batches are discussed. Reports on 2D material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory (DRAM), static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM), and Flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to three&#8208;dimensional (3D) monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, which are mostly focused on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, we review the major challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D material&#8208;based memory, and also give perspectives on possible approaches towards a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication, hopefully shedding some light on future research in this field.

Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances, low power consumption as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D material-based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large-scale 2D memory devices in batches are discussed. Reports on 2D material-based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), static random-access memory (SRAM), and Flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to three-dimensional (3D) monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in-memory computing applications, which are mostly focused on logic-in-memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, we review the major challenges that impede the large-scale applications of 2D material-based memory, and also give perspectives on possible approaches towards a more reliable system-level fabrication, hopefully shedding some light on future research in this field.&lt;/p&gt;
