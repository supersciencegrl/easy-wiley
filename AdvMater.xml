         <title>Microbially Catalyzed Biomaterials for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Urease&#8208;producing haloalkalophilic&#160;bacteria can be used as biocatalyst adhered to the surface of bioceramics to form a biomineral layer: urea as the substrate is converted to carbonate by bacterial catalysis, and the subsequently increased CO32&#8722; reacts with the Ca2+ existing around the bacterial cells, leading to the formation of micro/nanostructures on the biomaterials. The newly generated micro/nanostructures facilitated by bacteria promote bone&#8208;forming bioactivity.








Abstract
Bone is a complex mineralized tissue composed of various organic (proteins, cells) and inorganic (hydroxyapatite, calcium carbonate) substances with micro/nanoscale structures. To improve interfacial bioactivity of bone&#8208;implanted biomaterials, extensive efforts are being made to fabricate favorable biointerface via surface modification. Inspired by microbially catalyzed mineralization, a novel concept to biologically synthesize the micro/nanostructures on bioceramics, microbial&#8208;assisted catalysis, is presented. It involves three processes: bacterial adhesion on biomaterials, production of CO32&#8722; assisted by bacteria, and nucleation and growth of CaCO3 nanocrystals on the surface of bioceramics. The microbially catalyzed biominerals exhibit relatively uniform micro/nanostructures on the surface of both 2D and 3D &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 bioceramics. The topographic and chemical cues of the grown micro/nanostructures present excellent in vitro and in vivo bone&#8208;forming bioactivity. The underlying mechanism is closely related to the activation of multiple biological processes associated with bone regeneration. The study offers a microbially catalytic concept and strategy of fabricating micro/nanostructured biomaterials for tissue regeneration.

         <title>Atmospheric Hygroscopic Ionogels with Dynamically Stable Cooling Interfaces Enable a Durable Thermoelectric Performance Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hygroscopic ionogel (RIG) is developed to dissipate waste heat from working thermoelectric generators (TEGs) through self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling to efficiently enhance their electric output. Moreover, the well&#8208;designed adhesive property of the RIG ensures a stable cooling interface with the targeted TEGs surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable improvement of thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
In thermoelectric generator (TEG) systems, heat dissipation from their cold sides is an accessible, low&#8208;cost, and effective way to increase the temperature gap for their thermoelectric performance enhancement. Although significant efforts have been dedicated mediated by hygroscopic hydrogel coolers as self&#8208;sustained alternatives for effective heat removal, it still remains a challenge for overcoming instabilities in their cooling process. The inevitable mechanical deformation of these conventional hydrogels induced by excessive water desorption may cause a detached cooling interface with the targeted substrates, leading to undesirable cooling failure. Herein, a self&#8208;sustained and durable evaporative cooling approach for TEG enabled by atmospheric hygroscopic ionogels (RIGs) with stable interfaces to efficiently improve its thermoelectric performance is proposed. Owing to its superior hygroscopicity, the RIGs can achieve higher heat dissipation for TEG through water evaporation than that of common commercial metal heat sinks. Moreover, its favorable adhesion enables the RIG closely interact with the TEG surface either in static or dynamic conditions for a durable thermoelectric performance enhancement. It is believed that such a self&#8208;sustained evaporative cooling strategy based on the RIG will have great implications for the enhancement of TEG's efficiency, demonstrating a great promise in intermittent thermal&#8208;energy utilizations.

         <title>Thermoplastic Elastomer Tunes Phase Structure and Promotes Stretchability of High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of introducing low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer in the active layer is put forward to address the long&#8208;standing challenge of mechanical properties improvement of organic solar cells. Meanwhile, the morphology and mechanical performance of ternary blend films are effectively modulated and characterized with advanced scattering and microscopic techniques. This approach is effective to many kinds of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:nonfullerene systems.








Abstract
Top&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs) consisting of conjugated polymer donors and nonfullerene small molecule acceptors (NF&#8208;SMAs) deliver rapid increases in efficiencies. Nevertheless, many of the polymer donors exhibit high stiffness and small molecule acceptors are very brittle, which limit their applications in wearable devices. Here, a simple and effective strategy is reported to improve the stretchability and reduce the stiffness of high&#8208;efficiency polymer:NF&#8208;SMA blends and simultaneously maintain the high efficiency by incorporating a low&#8208;cost commercial thermoplastic elastomer, polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;poly(ethylene&#8208;ran&#8208;butylene)&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene (SEBS). The microstructure, mechanical properties, and photovoltaic performance of PM6:N3 with varied SEBS contents and the molecular weight dependence of SEBS on microstructure and mechanical properties are thoroughly characterized. This strategy for mechanical performance improvement exhibits excellent applicability in some other OSC blend systems, e.g., PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl and PBDB&#8208;T:ITIC. More crucially, the elastic modulus of such complex ternary blends can be nicely predicted by a mechanical model. Therefore, incorporating thermoplastic elastomers is a widely applicable and cost&#8208;effective strategy to improve mechanical properties of nonfullerene OSCs and beyond.

         <title>Amorphous VO2: A Pseudocapacitive Platform for High&#8208;Rate Symmetric Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wide&#8208;window pseudocapacitive behavior in amorphous VO2 is reported, which allows the construction of a new pseudocapacitive&#8208;mechanism&#8208;enabled symmetric battery to mitigate the slow kinetics and cycling limitations of previous phase&#8208;transition&#8208;mechanism&#8208;based symmetric devices. Attractive safety superiority is illustrated in the new symmetric device, including high tolerance in overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, and large&#8208;current operation.








Abstract
Among the various VO2 polymorphs, the layered compound, VO2(B), has been the most widely investigated lithium&#8208;ion battery electrode material. For sodium&#8208;ion electrodes, however, an amorphous solid may be more advantageous as a result of the open framework to facilitate ion insertion and the ability to tolerate volumetric changes. Herein, it is shown that the Na+ insertion properties of amorphous VO2 (a&#8208;VO2) are superior to those of crystalline VO2(B). Amorphous VO2 exhibits a linear voltage characteristic over a 3 V range (4.0 to 1.0&#160;V vs Na/Na+) leading to a reversible capacity as high as 400 mAh g&#8722;1 and rapid redox kinetics, which is attributed to its pseudocapacitive nature. The linear voltage characteristic over 3 V affords the opportunity of fabricating a symmetric Na&#8208;ion battery in which the a&#8208;VO2 material serves as both the positive electrode and the negative electrode. Such a symmetric battery offers safer operation in terms of overcharging, overdischarging, polarity reversal, high charge/discharge current abuse, and long&#8208;term usage. The results suggest that amorphous transition metal oxides may offer advantageous attributes for rapid, safe, and energy&#8208;dense storage.

         <title>Optimized Photoclick (Bio)Resins for Fast Volumetric Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Volumetric printing enables the generation of centimeter&#8208;sized free&#8208;form 3D objects within seconds. Optimized photoclick&#8208;based photoresins show ideal biophysical and photochemical properties resulting in fast and biocompatible volumetric bioprinting. Thiol&#8211;norbornene photo&#8208;crosslinking outperforms chain&#8208;growth systems permitting significant reduction of radical generation and polymer concentration. This simple and scalable synthesis method opens new avenues for widespread use of photoclick resins in light&#8208;mediated biofabrication.








Abstract
Volumetric printing (VP) is a light&#8208;mediated technique enabling printing of complex, low&#8208;defect 3D objects within seconds, overcoming major drawbacks of layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing. An optimized photoresin is presented for VP in the presence of cells (volumetric bioprinting) based on fast thiol&#8211;ene step&#8208;growth photoclick crosslinking. Gelatin&#8208;norbornene (Gel&#8208;NB) photoresin shows superior performance, both in physicochemical and biocompatibility aspects, compared to (meth&#8208;)acryloyl resins. The extremely efficient thiol&#8211;norbornene reaction produces the fastest VP reported to date (&#8776;10 s), with significantly lower polymer content, degree of substitution (DS), and radical species, making it more suitable for cell encapsulation. This approach enables the generation of cellular free&#8208;form constructs with excellent cell viability (&#8776;100%) and tissue maturation potential, demonstrated by development of contractile myotubes. Varying the DS, polymer content, thiol&#8211;ene ratio, and thiolated crosslinker allows fine&#8208;tuning of mechanical properties over a broad stiffness range (&#8776;40&#160;Pa to &#8776;15&#160;kPa). These properties are achieved through fast and scalable methods for producing Gel&#8208;NB with inexpensive, off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf reagents that can help establish it as the gold standard for light&#8208;mediated biofabrication techniques. With potential applications from high&#8208;throughput bioprinting of tissue models to soft robotics and regenerative medicine, this work paves the way for exploitation of VPs unprecedented capabilities.

         <title>Light&#8208;Motivated SnO2/TiO2 Heterojunctions Enabling the Breakthrough in Energy Density for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photoaccelerated rechargeable lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is demonstrated. The lithiation kinetics and reversibility are greatly enhanced, leading to 1.8 times increase in areal specific capacity without attenuation even for 100 cycles. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the energy density of LIBs by conversion and storage of solar energy.








Abstract
Powering lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) by light&#8208;irradiation will bring a paradigm shift in energy&#8208;storage technologies. Herein, a photoaccelerated rechargeable LIB employing SnO2/TiO2 heterojunction nanoarrays as a multifunctional anode is developed. The electron&#8211;hole pairs generated by the LixTiO2 (x&#160;&#8805; 0) under light irradiation synergistically enhance the lithiation kinetics and electrochemical reversibility of both SnO2 and TiO2. Specifically, the electrons can quickly pour into the SnO2 and the generated Sn due to the more positive conduction band potentials (vs TiO2), and mean while the holes also promote the intercalation of Li+ into TiO2 by reaching charge balance. A remarkable increase in areal specific capacity is therefore achieved from 1.91 to 3.47 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. More impressively, there is no capacity loss even through 100 cycles, which is the best report for photorechargeable LIBs to date, owing to the strong and stable photoresponse current. This finding exhibits a feasible pathway to break the limitation in the energy density of LIBs by the efficient conversion and storage of solar energy.

         <title>A Morphologically Stable Li/Electrolyte Interface for All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by 3D&#8208;Micropatterned Garnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries. A novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. The stabilization is achieved by utilizing the synergistic effect of electrochemical and mechanical modifications at the Li/SSE interface.








Abstract
Morphological degradation at the Li/solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) interface is a prevalent issue causing performance fading of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs). To maintain the interfacial integrity, most ASSBs are operated under low current density with considerable stack pressure, which significantly limits their widespread usage. Herein, a novel 3D&#8208;micropatterned SSE (3D&#8208;SSE) that can stabilize the morphology of the Li/SSE interface even under relatively high current density and limited stack pressure is reported. Under the pressure of 1.0&#160;MPa, the Li symmetric cell using a garnet&#8208;type 3D&#8208;SSE fabricated by laser machining shows a high critical current density of 0.7&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and stable cycling over 500 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2. This excellent performance is attributed to the reduced local current density and amplified mechanical stress at the Li/3D&#8208;SSE interface. These two effects can benefit the flux balance between Li stripping and creep at the interface, thereby preventing interfacial degradation such as void formation and dendrite growth.

         <title>Rippling Ferroic Phase Transition and Domain Switching In 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ripples are strongly coupled with ferroic orders in 2D ferroics. Taking monolayer ferroelectric&#8211;ferroelastic GeSe as an example, it is shown that rippling ferroic phase transition and domain switching can render ultrahigh piezoelectric performance over a broad temperature range in 2D materials. This provides valuable guidance for ripple engineering in 2D materials with potential applications in 2D flexible electronics.








Abstract
Ripples are a class of native structural defects widely existing in 2D materials. They originate from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of 2D materials introducing spatially evolving electronic structure and friction behavior. However, the effect of ripples on 2D ferroics has not been reported. Here a molecular dynamics study of the effect of ripples on the temperature&#8208;induced ferroic phase transition and stress&#8208;induced ferroic domain switching in ferroelastic&#8208;ferroelectric monolayer GeSe is presented. Ripples stabilize the short&#8208;range ferroic orders in the high&#8208;temperature phase with stronger ferroicity and longer lifetime, thereby increasing the transition temperature upon cooling. In addition, ripples significantly affect the domain switching upon loading, changing it from a highly correlated process into a ripple&#8208;driven localized one where ripples act as source of dynamical random stress. These results reveal the fundamental role of ripples on 2D ferroicity and provide theoretical guidance for ripple engineering of controlled phase transition and domain switching with potential applications in flexible 2D electronics.

         <title>An Antipulverization and High&#8208;Continuity Lithium Metal Anode for High&#8208;Energy Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro&#8208;sized, and dendrite&#8208;free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high&#8208;continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&#8722;2. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high&#8208;capacity retentions in their corresponding ether&#8208;based or carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.

     alt="An Antipulverization and High-Continuity Lithium Metal Anode for High-Energy Lithium Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An antipulverization and high-continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid-state electrolyte nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper foil as supporting current collector is proposed to improve the lithium electrode stability and extend the cyclability of batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lithium metal is one of the most promising anode candidates for next-generation high-energy batteries. Nevertheless, lithium pulverization and associated loss of electrical contact remain significant challenges. Here, an antipulverization and high-continuity lithium metal anode comprising a small number of solid-state electrolyte (SSE) nanoparticles as conformal/sacrificial fillers and a copper (Cu) foil as the supporting current collector is reported. Guiding by the SSE, this new anode facilitates lithium nucleation, contributing to form a roundly shaped, micro-sized, and dendrite-free electrode during cycling, which effectively mitigates the lithium dendrite growth. The embedded Cu current collector in the hybrid anode not only reinforces the mechanical strength but also improves the efficient charge transfer among active lithium filaments, affording good electrode structural integrity and electrical continuity. As a result, this antipulverization and high-continuity lithium anode delivers a high average Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99.6% for 300 cycles under a current density of 1 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (elemental sulfur or sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathodes) equipped with this anode show high-capacity retentions in their corresponding ether-based or carbonate-based electrolytes, respectively. This new electrode provides important insight into the design of electrodes that may experience large volume variation during operations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Specificity In Vivo Tumor Imaging Using Bioorthogonal NIR&#8208;IIb Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioorthogonal lanthanide&#8208;based nanoprobes are developed for deep&#8208;tissue NIR&#8208;IIb imaging and MRI with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity. These bioorthogonal nanoprobes offer a 20&#8208;fold increase in the NIR&#8208;IIb imaging signal and a 2&#8208;fold increase in the MRI signal, compared with non&#8208;orthogonal probes.








Abstract
Lanthanide&#8208;based NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes are ideal for in vivo imaging. However, existing NIR&#8208;IIb nanoprobes often suffer from low tumor&#8208;targeting specificity, limiting their widespread use. Here the application of bioorthogonal nanoprobes with high tumor&#8208;targeting specificity for in vivo NIR&#8208;IIb luminescence imaging and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is reported. These dual&#8208;modality nanoprobes can enhance NIR&#8208;IIb emission by 20&#8208;fold and MRI signal by twofold, compared with non&#8208;bioorthogonal nanoprobes in murine subcutaneous tumors. Moreover, these bioorthogonal probes enable orthotopic brain tumor imaging. Implementation of bio&#8208;orthogonal chemistry significantly reduces the nanoprobe dose and hence cytotoxicity, providing a paradigm for real&#8208;time in vivo visualization of tumors.

         <title>ZnS@BSA Nanoclusters Potentiate Efficacy of Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters can promote reactive oxygen species accumulation and activate cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8211;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator signals in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), further suppressing tumor growth with more immune cells infiltration, which can serve as a new strategy for immunotherapy of HCC.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy such as immune checkpoint inhibitors has shown promising efficacy in cancer treatment, the responsiveness among patients is relatively limited. Activation of the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase/interferon gene stimulator (cGAS/STING) signaling pathway to upregulate innate immunity has become an emerging strategy for enhancing tumor immunotherapy. Herein, ZnS@BSA (bovine serum albumin) nanoclusters synthesized via a self&#8208;assembly approach are reported, where the released zinc ions under acidic tumor microenvironment significantly enhance cGAS/STING signals. Meanwhile, intracellular zinc ions can produce reactive oxygen species, which is further facilitated by the generated H2S gas from ZnS@BSA via specifically inhibiting catalase in hepatocellular carcinoma cells. It is found that the nanoclusters activate the cGAS/STING signals in mice, which promotes the infiltration of CD8+ T cells at the tumor site and cross&#8208;presentation of dendritic cells, leading to an improved immunotherapy efficacy against hepatocellular carcinoma.

         <title>Construction of Carbon Dots with Color&#8208;Tunable Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission by Nitrogen&#8208;Induced Intramolecular Charge Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon dots (CDs) with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission exhibit dual fluorescence emission at 480 and 580&#160;nm, which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of DTSA and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. With the increase of C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the intramolecular charge transfer efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of the CDs from green to red.








Abstract
As one of the most promising fluorescent nanomaterials, the fluorescence of carbon dots (CDs) in solution is extensively studied. Nevertheless, the synthesis of multicolor solid&#8208;state fluorescence (SSF) CDs is rarely reported. Herein, CDs with multicolor aggregation&#8208;induced emission are prepared using amine molecules, all of them exhibiting dual fluorescence emission at 480&#160;nm (Em&#8208;1) and 580&#8211;620&#160;nm (Em&#8208;2), which is related to the S&#63743;S bonds of dithiosalicylic acid and the conjugated structure attached to C&#63742;O/C&#63742;N bonds, respectively. As a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing group, the increase of C&#63742;N content makes dual&#8208;fluorescent groups on the surface of CDs produce push and pull electrons, which determines intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) between the double emission. With the increase in C&#63742;N content from 35.6% to 58.4%, the ICT efficiency increases from 8.71% to 45.94%, changing the fluorescence of CDs from green to red. The increase of ICT efficiency causes fluorescence quantum yield enhancement by nearly five times and redshift of the fluorescence peak. Finally, based on the multicolor luminescence properties induced by the aggregation of CDs, pattern encryption and white&#8208;LED devices are realized. Based on the fat solubility and strong ultraviolet absorption characteristics of CDs, fingerprint detection and leaf anti&#8208;UV hazards are applied.

         <title>Dynamically Tuneable Reflective Structural Coloration with Electroactive Conducting Polymer Nanocavities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically tuneable structural coloration is demonstrated based on an optical cavity with a conducting polymer based on thienothiophene as an electroactive spacer layer. Synergistic effects of optical properties and thickness changes enable low&#8208;voltage tuning of the structural color across the whole visible range with high and similar reflectance for all the redox states.








Abstract
Dynamic control of structural colors across the visible spectrum with high brightness has proven to be a difficult challenge. Here, this is addressed with a tuneable reflective nano&#8208;optical cavity that uses an electroactive conducting polymer (poly(thieno[3,4&#8208;b]thiophene)) as spacer layer. Electrochemical doping and dedoping of the polymer spacer layer provides reversible tuning of the cavity's structural color throughout the entire visible range and beyond. Furthermore, the cavity provides high peak reflectance that varies only slightly between the reduced and oxidized states of the polymer. The results indicate that the polymer undergoes large reversible thickness changes upon redox tuning, aided by changes in optical properties and low visible absorption. The electroactive cavity concept may find particular use in reflective displays, by opening for tuneable monopixels that eliminate limitations in brightness of traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems.

An n&#8208;type surface is realized successfully on p&#8208;type CZTSSe thin film by controlling the Ag distribution using Ag2ZnSnS4/Al2O3/CZTS precursors. The photogenerated charge collection is improved and the interface recombination is suppressed, thus significantly improving the conversion efficiency of the CZTSSe solar cells.








Abstract
As a low&#8208;cost substitute that uses no expensive rare&#8208;earth elements for the high&#8208;efficiency Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cell, the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cell has borrowed optimization strategies used for its predecessor to improve its device performance, including a profiled band gap and surface inversion. Indeed, there have been few reports of constructing CZTSSe absorber layers with surface inversion to improve efficiency. Here, a strategy that designs the CZTSSe absorber to attain surface modification by using n&#8208;type Ag2ZnSnS4 is demonstrated. It has been discovered that Ag plays two major roles in the kesterite thin film devices: surface inversion and front gradient distribution. It has not only an excellent carrier transport effect and reduced probability of electron&#8208;hole recombination but also results in increased carrier separation by increasing the width of the depletion region, leading to much improved VOC and JSC. Finally, a champion CZTSSe solar cell renders efficiency as high as 12.55%, one of the highest for its type, with the open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit reduced to as low as 0.306&#160;V (63.2% Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit). The band engineering for surface modification of the absorber and high efficiency achieved here shine a new light on the future of the CZTSSe solar cell.

         <title>Multifunctional Macroassembled Graphene Nanofilms with High Crystallinity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline macroassembled graphene nanofilms prepared by a camphor&#8208;assisted cooling&#8211;contraction strategy show excellent physical properties and advantages in high&#8208;performance electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
A &#8220;cooling&#8211;contraction&#8221; method to separate large&#8208;area (up to 4.2&#160;cm in lateral size) graphene oxide (GO)&#8208;assembled films (of nanoscale thickness) from substrates is reported. Heat treatment at 3000&#160;&#176;C of such free&#8208;standing macroscale films yields highly crystalline &#8220;macroassembled graphene nanofilms&#8221; (nMAGs) with 16&#8211;48&#160;nm thickness. These nMAGs present tensile strength of 5.5&#8211;11.3&#160;GPa (with &#8776;3&#160;&#181;m gauge length), electrical conductivity of 1.8&#8211;2.1 MS m&#8722;1, thermal conductivity of 2027&#8211;2820 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, and carrier relaxation time up to &#8776;23&#160;ps. As a demonstration application, an nMAG&#8208;based sound&#8208;generator shows a 30 &#181;s response and sound pressure level of 89&#160;dB at 1 W cm&#8722;2. A THz metasurface fabricated from nMAG has a light response of 8.2% for 0.159 W mm&#8722;2 and can detect down to 0.01&#160;ppm of glucose. The approach provides a straightforward way to form highly crystallized graphene nanofilms from low&#8208;cost GO sheets.

         <title>Conductive CuCo&#8208;Based Bimetal Organic Framework for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conductive bimetal&#8208;based catecholate (CAT) nanorod arrays show excellent hydrogen evolution reaction activities in both alkaline and neutral electrolyte, comparable to that of the benchmark Pt/C. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the incorporation of Co not only optimizes the &#916;GH* and the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Cu&#8208;CAT, but also increases the electrical conductivity of Cu&#8208;CAT.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with intrinsically porous structures and well&#8208;dispersed metal sites are promising candidates for electrocatalysis; however, the catalytic efficiencies of most MOFs are significantly limited by their impertinent adsorption/desorption energy of intermediates formed during electrocatalysis and very low electrical conductivity. Herein, Co is introduced into conductive Cu&#8208;catecholate (Cu&#8208;CAT) nanorod arrays directly grown on a flexible carbon cloth for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Electrochemical results show that the Co&#8208;incorporated Cu&#8208;CAT nanorod arrays only need 52 and 143&#160;mV overpotentials to drive a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in alkaline and neutral media for HER, respectively, much lower than most of the reported non&#8208;noble metal&#8208;based electrocatalysts and comparable to the benchmark Pt/C electrocatalyst. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of Co can optimize the adsorption energy of hydrogen (&#916;GH*) of Cu sites, almost close to that of Pt (111). Furthermore, the adsorption energy of water (&#916;EH2O) of Co sites in the CuCo&#8208;CAT is significantly lower than that of Cu sites upon coupling Cu with Co, effectively accelerating the Volmer step in the HER process. The findings, synergistic effect of bimetals, open a new avenue for the rational design of highly efficient MOF&#8208;based electrocatalysts.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 Costructures Boost Oxygen Reduction Reaction in Both Alkaline and Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ternary&#8208;atom electrocatalyst, in which atomically dispersed Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites are coanchored on N&#8208;doped carbon hosts (derived from reaction with ZIF&#8208;8), is synthesized. Synergistic effect is explicitly unraveled, which induces higher filling degree of Fe d&#8208;orbitals and outstanding oxygen reduction reaction activity in both alkaline and acidic media.








Abstract
Polynary transition&#8208;metal atom catalysts are promising to supersede platinum (Pt)&#8208;based catalysts for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Regulating the local configuration of atomic catalysts is the key to catalyst performance enhancement. Different from the previously reported single&#8208;atom or dual&#8208;atom configurations, a new type of ternary&#8208;atom catalyst, which consists of atomically dispersed, nitrogen&#8208;coordinated Co&#8211;Co dimers, and Fe single sites (i.e., Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 structures) that are coanchored on highly graphitized carbon supports is developed. This unique atomic ORR catalyst outperforms the catalysts with only Co2&#8211;N6 or Fe&#8211;N4 sites in both alkaline and acid conditions. Density functional theory calculations clearly unravels the synergistic effect of the Co2&#8211;N6 and Fe&#8211;N4 sites, which can induce higher filling degree of Fe&#8211;d orbitals and favors the binding capability to *OH intermediates (the rate determining step). This ternary&#8208;atom catalyst may be a promising alternative to Pt to drive the cathodic ORR in zinc&#8211;air batteries.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered InP nanowire array photodetector that can achieve single&#8208;photon&#8208;level light detection at room temperature without an external bias is reported.

Highly sensitive photodetectors with single&#8208;photon level detection are one of the key components to a range of emerging technologies, in particular the ever&#8208;growing field of optical communication, remote sensing, and quantum computing. Currently, most of the single&#8208;photon detection technologies require external biasing at high voltages and/or cooling to low temperatures, posing great limitations for wider applications. Here, InP nanowire array photodetectors that can achieve single&#8208;photon level light detection at room temperature without an external bias are demonstrated. Top&#8208;down etched, heavily doped p&#8208;type InP nanowires and n&#8208;type aluminium&#8208;doped zinc oxide (AZO)/zinc oxide (ZnO) carrier&#8208;selective contact are used to form a radial p&#8211;n junction with a built&#8208;in electric field exceeding 3 &#215; 105&#160;V cm&#8722;1&#160;at 0&#160;V. The device exhibits broadband light sensitivity and can distinguish a single photon per pulse from the dark noise at 0&#160;V, enabled by its design to realize near&#8208;ideal broadband absorption, extremely low dark current, and highly efficient charge carrier separation. Meanwhile, the bandwidth of the device reaches above 600&#160;MHz with a timing jitter of 538&#160;ps. The proposed device design provides a new pathway toward low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;sensitivity, self&#8208;powered photodetectors for numerous future applications.

         <title>Synergistic Enzyme Mixtures to Realize Near&#8208;Complete Depolymerization in Biodegradable Polymer/Additive Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
When enzymes with deep, narrow active sites are embedded inside of plastics, chain&#8208;end&#8208;mediated processive depolymerization is realized. However, polymer additives can induce bending in crystalline lamellae, which causes chain ends to preferentially segregate at the crystal/amorphous interface where they are inaccessible for enzyme binding. Synergistic enzyme mechanisms can be exploited to create new chain ends and facilitate near&#8208;complete depolymerization.








Abstract
Embedding catalysts inside of plastics affords accelerated chemical modification with programmable latency and pathways. Nanoscopically embedded enzymes can lead to near&#8208;complete degradation of polyesters via chain&#8208;end mediated processive depolymerization. The overall degradation rate and pathways have a strong dependence on the morphology of semicrystalline polyesters. Yet, most studies to date focus on pristine polymers instead of mixtures that contain additives and other components despite their nearly universal use in plastic production. Here, additives are introduced to purposely change the morphology of polycaprolactone (PCL) by increasing the bending and twisting of crystalline lamellae. These morphological changes immobilize chain ends preferentially at the crystalline/amorphous interfaces and limit chain&#8208;end accessibility by the embedded processive enzyme. This chain&#8208;end redistribution reduces the polymer&#8208;to&#8208;monomer conversion from &gt;95%&#160;to less than 50%, causing formation of highly crystalline plastic pieces, including microplastics. By synergizing both random chain scission and processive depolymerization, it is feasible to navigate morphological changes in polymer/additive blends and to achieve near&#8208;complete depolymerization. The random scission enzymes in the amorphous domains create new chain ends that are subsequently bound and depolymerized by processive enzymes. Present studies further highlight the importance to consider how the host polymer's morphologies affect the reactions catalyzed by embedded catalytic species.

         <title>Physical Disruption of Solid Tumors by Immunostimulatory Microrobots Enhances Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Micromotors coated with bacterial membrane are utilized for combinatorial cancer therapy. Upon intratumoral administration, the micromotors induce irreversible physical damage to the tumor tissue, while the immunostimulatory membrane recruits host immune cells to process tumor antigens in situ. Treatment of solid tumors using this platform results in robust antitumor immunity that can also control the growth of distant secondary tumors.








Abstract
The combination of immunotherapy with other forms of treatment is an emerging strategy for boosting antitumor responses. By combining multiple modes of action, these combinatorial therapies can improve clinical outcomes through unique synergisms. Here, a microrobot&#8208;based strategy that integrates tumor tissue disruption with biological stimulation is shown for cancer immunotherapy. The microrobot is fabricated by loading bacterial outer membrane vesicles onto a self&#8208;propelling micromotor, which can react with water to generate a propulsion force. When administered intratumorally to a solid tumor, the disruption of the local tumor tissue coupled with the delivery of an immunostimulatory payload leads to complete tumor regression. Additionally, treatment of the primary tumor results in the simultaneous education of the host immune system, enabling it to control the growth of distant tumors. Overall, this work introduces a distinct application of microrobots in cancer immunotherapy and offers an attractive strategy for amplifying cancer treatment efficacy when combined with conventional therapies.

         <title>Surface&#8208;Dependent Intermediate Adsorption Modulation on Iridium&#8208;Modified Black Phosphorus Electrocatalysts for Efficient pH&#8208;Universal Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient iridium&#8208;modified 2D black phosphorus electrocatalyst is rationally designed to achieve the desired adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates, and the resultant catalyst demonstrates outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performances, surpassing the commercially dominating catalysts. Furthermore, an interesting surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism is identified.








Abstract
2D black phosphorus (BP) is one promising electrocatalyst toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysis. The too strong adsorption of oxygen intermediates during OER, while the too weak adsorption of hydrogen intermediate during HER, however, greatly compromise its practical water splitting applications with overpotentials as high as 450&#160;mV for OER and 420&#160;mV for HER to achieve 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 under alkaline conditions. Herein, by rationally introducing the nanosized iridium (Ir) modifier together with optimized exposing surface toward electrolytes, an efficient Ir&#8208;modified BP electrocatalyst with much favorable adsorption energies toward catalytic intermediates possesses an outstanding pH&#8208;universal water splitting performance, surpassing the nearly all reported BP&#8208;based catalysts and the commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts. The Ir&#8208;modified BP catalyst with the optimized exposed surfaces only requires an overall cell voltage of 1.54 and 1.57&#160;V to achieve 10 mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline electrolysers, respectively. This design uncovers the potential applications of 2D BP in practical electrocatalysis fields via decreasing reaction intermediate adsorption energy barriers and promoting the interfacial electron coupling for heterostructured catalysts, and offers new insights into the surface&#8208;dependent activity enhancement mechanism.

         <title>Fluorescent Nanozeolite Receptors for the Highly Selective and Sensitive Detection of Neurotransmitters in Water and Biofluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorescent artificial receptors that bind neurotransmitters with unprecedented affinity and selectivity in biofluids are introduced. They are based on nanozeolite hybrid materials and can be used for emission&#8208; and absorbance&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentration, for (two&#8208;photon) imaging, and for label&#8208;free enzymatic reaction monitoring in real time.








Abstract
The design and preparation of synthetic binders (SBs) applicable for small biomolecule sensing in aqueous media remains very challenging. SBs designed by the lock&#8208;and&#8208;key principle can be selective for their target analyte but usually show an insufficient binding strength in water. In contrast, SBs based on symmetric macrocycles with a hydrophobic cavity can display high binding affinities but generally suffer from indiscriminate binding of many analytes. Herein, a completely new and modular receptor design strategy based on microporous hybrid materials is presented yielding zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs) which reversibly bind the neurotransmitters serotonin and dopamine with unprecedented affinity and selectivity even in saline biofluids. ZARs are thought to uniquely exploit both the non&#8208;classical hydrophobic effect and direct non&#8208;covalent recognition motifs, which is supported by in&#8208;depth photophysical, and calorimetric experiments combined with full atomistic modeling. ZARs are thermally and chemically robust and can be readily prepared at gram scales. Their applicability for the label&#8208;free monitoring of important enzymatic reactions, for (two&#8208;photon) fluorescence imaging, and for high&#8208;throughput diagnostics in biofluids is demonstrated. This study showcases that artificial receptor based on microporous hybrid materials can overcome standing limitations of synthetic chemosensors, paving the way towards personalized diagnostics and metabolomics.

         <title>Facile Synthesis of Palladium&#8208;Based Nanocrystals with Different Crystal Phases and a Comparison of Their Catalytic Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
There is a strong interest in developing phase&#8208;controlled metal nanocrystals to enhance their catalytic activity. In this work, template&#8208;directed growth is used to synthesize Ru@Pd nanocrystals with the Pd shells in either an fcc or hcp phase, and their catalytic properties are compared.








Abstract
A relatively unexplored aspect of noble&#8208;metal nanomaterials is polymorphism, or their ability to crystallize in different crystal phases. Here, a method is reported for the facile synthesis of Ru@Pd core&#8211;shell nanocrystals featuring polymorphism, with the core made of hexagonally close&#8208;packed (hcp)&#8208;Ru while the Pd shell takes either an hcp or face&#8208;centered cubic (fcc) phase. The polymorphism shows a dependence on the shell thickness, with shells thinner than &#8776;1.4&#160;nm taking the hcp phase whereas the thicker ones revert to fcc. The injection rate provides an experimental knob for controlling the phase, with one&#8208;shot and drop&#8208;wise injection of the Pd precursor corresponding to fcc&#8208;Pd and hcp&#8208;Pd shells, respectively. When these nanocrystals are tested as catalysts toward formic acid oxidation, the Ru@Pdhcp nanocrystals outperform Ru@Pdfcc in terms of both specific activity and peak potential. Density functional theory calculations are also performed to elucidate the origin of this performance enhancement.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Carbon Superstructures Achieving Ultra&#8208;Stable and Fast Proton&#8208;Coupled Charge Storage Kinetics</title>

Complementary acceptor&#8211;donor molecules of 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone form a porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which offers the cornerstone for H&#8208;bonding self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to carbon superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The superstructures achieve ultrastable and fast proton&#8208;coupled charge storage kinetics, giving unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles) and high energy density for carbon (zinc) supercapacitors.








Abstract
Designing ingenious and stable carbon nanostructures is critical but still challenging for use in energy storage devices with superior electrochemistry kinetics, durable capacitive activity, and high rate survivability. To pursue the objective, a simple self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed to access carbon superstructures built of nanoparticle embedded plates. The carbon precursors, 2,4,6&#8208;trichloro&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;triazine and 2,6&#8208;diaminoanthraquinone can form porous organic polymer with &#8220;protic salt&#8221;&#8208;type rigid skeleton linked by &#8722;NH2+Cl&#8722;&#8722; &#8220;rivets&#8221;, which provides the cornerstone for hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;guided self&#8208;assembly of the organic backbone to superstructures by &#960;&#8722;&#960; plane stacking. The ameliorative charge density distribution and decreased adsorption energy in as&#8208;fabricated carbon superstructures allow the high accessibility of the build&#8208;in protophilic sites and efficient ion diffusion with a low energy barrier. Such superstructures thus deliver ultra&#8208;stable charge storage and fast proton&#8208;coupled kinetics at the structural&#8722;chemical defects, contributing to unprecedented lifespan (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), high&#8208;rate capability (100 A g&#8722;1) for carbon&#8208;based supercapacitors, and an ultrahigh energy density (128&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) for Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors. The self&#8208;assembled carbon superstructures significantly improve the all&#8208;round electrochemical performances, and hold great promise for efficient energy storage.

         <title>A Regioselectively Oxidized 2D Bi/BiOx Lateral Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Hypoxic Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure is fabricated to effectively generate 1O2 under normoxia but produce cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances photodynamic therapy. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with surface molecular engineering, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation.








Abstract
Optoelectronic science and 2D nanomaterial technologies are currently at the forefront of multidisciplinary research and have numerous applications in electronics and photonics. The unique energy and optically induced interfacial electron transfer in these nanomaterials, enabled by their relative band alignment characteristics, can provide important therapeutic modalities for healthcare. Given that nano&#8208;heterostructures can facilitate photoinduced electron&#8211;hole separation and enhance generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), 2D nano&#8208;heterostructure&#8208;based photosensitizers can provide a major advancement in photodynamic therapy (PDT), to overcome the current limitations in hypoxic tumor microenvironments. Herein, a bismuthene/bismuth oxide (Bi/BiOx)&#8208;based lateral nano&#8208;heterostructure synthesized using a regioselective oxidation process is introduced, which, upon irradiation at 660&#160;nm, effectively generates 1O2 under normoxia but produces cytotoxic &#8226;OH and H2 under hypoxia, which synergistically enhances PDT. Furthermore, this Bi/BiOx nano&#8208;heterostructure is biocompatible and biodegradable, and, with the surface molecular engineering used here, it improves tumor tissue penetration and increases cellular uptake during in vitro and in vivo experiments, yielding excellent oxygen&#8208;independent tumor ablation with 660&#160;nm irradiation, when compared with traditional PDT agents.

Gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell quantum&#8208;rod downconverters showing high&#8208;efficacy light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) covering a wide color gamut are reported. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and Auger recombination and maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These LEDs show luminous efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 and wide color gamut.








Abstract
Efficient white light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with an efficacy of 200&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 are much desirable for lighting and displays. The phosphor&#8208;based LEDs in use today for display applications offer poor color saturation. Intensive efforts have been made to replace the phosphor with quantum&#8208;dot&#8208;based downconverters, but the efficiency and stability of these devices are still in their infancy. Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out&#8208;coupling efficiency in the solid&#8208;state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8722;xS/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid&#8208;state (81%). These QR&#8208;based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1 (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art quantum dots and phosphor&#8208;based on&#8208;chip LEDs.

Quantum rods (QRs), nanoparticles with an elongated shape, show superior properties such as relatively larger Stokes shifts, polarized emission, and high light out-coupling efficiency in the solid-state. However, these QRs usually suffer from poor optical quality for PL wavelengths &amp;lt;&#160;550&#160;nm. Herein, a gradient alloyed CdSe/Zn&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Cd&lt;sub&gt;1&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;S/ZnS and CdSe/CdS/ZnS core/shell/shell QR downconverters showing high efficacy LEDs covering a wide color gamut are reported. These QRs show high stability and a precisely tunable photoluminescence peak. The engineered shell thickness suppresses energy transfer and thus maintains the high quantum yield in the solid-state (81%). These QR-based LEDs attain an efficacy of 149&#160;lm&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (@10mA) and&#160;wide color gamut (118% NTSC), which is exceedingly higher than state-of-the-art quantum dots and phosphor-based on-chip LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Tailoring with Bifunctional Integration for High&#8208;Performance CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8211;Ru dual&#8208;atoms inside conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are designed for regulation of outstanding synergistic photocatalysis during light&#8208;driven CO2 conversion, of which the bifunctionalized Co&#8211;Ru sites feature atom&#8208;specific functions with Co for dynamic carrier mobility and Ru for selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom photocatalysis has been demonstrated as a novel strategy to promote heterogeneous reactions. There is a diversity of monoatomic metal species with specific functions; however, integrating representative merits into dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms and regulating cooperative photocatalysis remain a pressing challenge. For dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom catalysts, enhanced photocatalytic activity would be realized through integrating bifunctional properties and tuning the synergistic effect. Herein, dual&#8208;single&#8208;atoms supported on conjugated porous carbon nitride polymer are developed for effective photocatalytic CO2 reduction, featuring the function of cobalt (Co) and ruthenium (Ru). A series of in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations are conducted for quantitative analysis of structure&#8211;performance correlation. It is concluded that the active Co sites facilitate dynamic charge transfer, while the Ru sites promote selective CO2 surface&#8208;bound interaction during CO2 photoreduction. The combination of atom&#8208;specific traits and the synergy between Co and Ru lead to the high photocatalytic CO2 conversion with corresponding apparent quantum efficiency (AQE) of 2.8% at 385&#160;nm, along with a high turnover number (TON) of more than 200 without addition of any sacrificial agent. This work presents an example of identifying the roles of different single&#8208;atom metals and regulating the synergy, where the two metals with unique properties collaborate to further boost the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Fe&#8208;Ion Bolted VOPO4&#8729;2H2O as an Aqueous Fe&#8208;Ion Battery Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Iron&#8208;ion batteries are promising for grid energy storage due to their low cost and compatibility with aqueous electrolytes. This work demonstrates vanadium oxyphosphate as a capable cathode to host Fe2+. Vanadium oxyphosphate exhibits structural stability favoring Fe2+ to Zn2+ due to the bolting effect by the pre&#8208;intercalated Fe3+ before battery cycling.








Abstract
Iron ion batteries using Fe2+ as a charge carrier have yet to be widely explored, and they lack high&#8208;performing Fe2+ hosting cathode materials to couple with the iron metal anode. Here, it is demonstrated that VOPO4&#8729;2H2O can reversibly host Fe2+ with a high specific capacity of 100 mAh g&#8722;1 and stable cycling performance, where 68% of the initial capacity is retained over 800 cycles. In sharp contrast, VOPO4&#8729;2H2O's capacity of hosting Zn2+ fades precipitously over tens of cycles. VOPO4&#8729;2H2O stores Fe2+ with a unique mechanism, where upon contacting the electrolyte by the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O electrode, Fe2+ ions from the electrolyte get oxidized to Fe3+ ions that are inserted and trapped in the VOPO4&#8729;2H2O structure in an electroless redox reaction. The trapped Fe3+ ions, thus, bolt the layered structure of VOPO4&#8729;2H2O, which prevents it from dissolution into the electrolyte during (de)insertion of Fe2+. The findings offer a new strategy to use a redox&#8208;active ion charge carrier to stabilize the layered electrode materials.

         <title>Towards High Performance Li&#8211;S Batteries via Sulfonate&#8208;Rich COF&#8208;Modified Separator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of a sulfonate&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (COF)&#8208;modified separator is proposed for Li&#8211;S batteries, which provides a solution for tackling the issues of polysulfide shuttling and dendrite growth simultaneously. Benefiting from the chemical merits of strong electronegativity and large interlayer spacing for SCOF&#8208;2, the capacity and stability of rechargeable Li&#8211;S batteries are greatly improved.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are held great promise for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy&#8208;density devices; however, polysulfide shuttle and Li&#8208;dendrite growth severely hinders their commercial production. Herein, a sulfonate&#8208;rich COF (SCOF&#8208;2) is designed, synthesized, and used to modify the separator of Li&#8211;S batteries, providing a solution for the above challenges. It is found that the SCOF&#8208;2 features stronger electronegativity and larger interlayer spacing than that of none/monosulfonate COFs, which can facilitate the Li+ migration and alleviate the formation of Li&#8208;dendrites. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations and in situ Raman analysis demonstrate that the SCOF&#8208;2 possesses a narrow bandgap and strong interaction on sulfur species, thereby suppressing self&#8208;discharge behavior. As a result, the modified batteries deliver an ultralow attenuation rate of 0.047% per cycle over 800 cycles at 1 C, and excellent anti&#8208;self&#8208;discharge performance by a low&#8208;capacity attenuation of 6.0% over one week. Additionally, even with the high&#8208;sulfur&#8208;loading cathode (3.2&#8211;8.2 mgs cm&#8208;2) and lean electrolyte (5&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8208;1), the batteries still exhibit &#8776;80% capacity retention over 100 cycles, showing great potential for practical application.

         <title>Enzymatically Transformable Polymersome&#8208;Based Nanotherapeutics to Eliminate Minimal Relapsable Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzymatically transformable nanotherapeutics is presented to improve the targeted delivery of old drugs&#8212;MMP inhibitor and colchicine&#8212;into minimal relapsable cancer. This distinct combination therapy not only ensures direct killing of residual cancer cells but also disrupts the premetastatic microenvironment to prevent distant seeding/outgrowth, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence after surgery.








Abstract
Prevention of metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence of cancer after surgery remains difficult. Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer&#8208;based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor&#8208;associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule&#8208;disrupting and anti&#8208;inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell&#8208;targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature&#8208;specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local&#8208;regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.

Targeting postsurgical premetastatic niche and microresiduals presents an excellent prospective opportunity but is often challenged by poor therapeutic delivery into minimal residual tumors. Here, an enzymatically transformable polymer-based nanotherapeutic approach is presented that exploits matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) overactivation in tumor-associated tissues to guide the codelivery of colchicine (microtubule-disrupting and anti-inflammatory agent) and marimastat (MMP inhibitor). The dePEGylation of polymersomes catalyzed by MMPs not only exposes the guanidine moiety to improve tissue/cell-targeting/retention to increase bioavailability, but also differentially releases marimastat and colchicine to engage their extracellular (MMPs) and intracellular (microtubules) targets of action, respectively. In primary tumors/overt metastases, the vasculature-specific targeting of nanotherapeutics can function synchronously with the enhanced permeability and retention effect to deter malignant progression of metastatic breast cancer. After the surgical removal of large primary tumors, nanotherapeutic agents are localized in the premetastatic niche and at the site of the postsurgical wound, disrupting the premetastatic microenvironment and eliminating microresiduals, which radically reduces metastatic and local-regional recurrence. The findings suggest that nanotherapeutics can safely widen the therapeutic window to resuscitate colchicine and MMP inhibitors for other inflammatory disorders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Extracellular Vesicles Enriched with Palmitoylated ACE2 as COVID&#8208;19 Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineered EVs enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2) efficiently capture SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 viruses and block their interaction with the cell surface ACE2, leading to reduced infection both in vitro and in vivo. This work identifies a novel palmitoylation&#8208;dependent mechanism whereby human cells package ACE2 into EVs, meanwhile developing PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs as a novel candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.








Abstract
Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is a key receptor present on cell surfaces that directly interacts with the viral spike (S) protein of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus&#8208;2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2). It is proposed that inhibiting this interaction can be promising in treating COVID&#8208;19. Here, the presence of ACE2 in extracellular vesicles (EVs) is reported and the EV&#8208;ACE2 levels are determined by protein palmitoylation. The Cys141 and Cys498 residues on ACE2 are S&#8208;palmitoylated by zinc finger DHHC&#8208;Type Palmitoyltransferase 3 (ZDHHC3) and de&#8208;palmitoylated by acyl protein thioesterase 1 (LYPLA1), which is critical for the membrane&#8208;targeting of ACE2 and their EV secretion. Importantly, by fusing the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with ACE2, EVs enriched with ACE2 on their surface (referred to as PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs) are engineered. It is shown that PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell surface ACE2 in vitro. PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs show neutralization potency against pseudotyped and authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 in human ACE2 (hACE2) transgenic mice, efficiently block viral load of authentic SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2, and thus protect host against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2&#8208;induced lung inflammation. The study provides an efficient engineering protocol for constructing a promising, novel biomaterial for application in prophylactic and therapeutic treatments against COVID&#8208;19.

         <title>Self&#8208;Supporting 3D Carbon Nitride with Tunable n &#8594; &#960;* Electronic Transition for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) polymeric carbon nitride (PCN), with tunable n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition, is successfully synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. The synergistic optimization of the SSD structure and n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in PCN significantly advance the exciton dissociation and optical absorption, leading to enhanced visible&#8208;light H2 evolution activity in the spectral region above 500&#160;nm.








Abstract
Self&#8208;supporting 3D (SSD) carbon nitrides (UCN&#8208;X, X&#160;= 600&#8211;690; where X represents the pyrolytic temperature) consisting of curved layers, with plenty of wrinkles and enlarged size, are synthesized via a facile stepwise pyrolytic strategy. Such unique features of the SSD structure exhibiting dramatically improved charge mobility, extended &#960;&#8208;conjugated aromatic system, and partial distortion of heptazine&#8208;based skeleton can not only keep the easier activation of the intrinsic &#960;&#160;&#8594; &#160;&#960;* electronic transition but also awaken the n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in carbon nitride. The n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition of UCN&#8208;X can be controllably tuned through changing the pyrolytic temperature, which can greatly extend the photoresponse range to 600&#160;nm. More importantly, the change regularity of H2 evolution rates is highly positive, correlated with the change tendency of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition in UCN&#8208;X, suggesting the positive contribution of n &#8594; &#960;* electronic transition to enhancing photocatalytic activity. The UCN&#8208;670, with optimal structural and optical properties, presents enhanced H2 evolution rate up to 9230&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 (Pt 1.1 wt%). This work realizes the synergistic optimization of optical absorption and exciton dissociation via fabricating an SSD structure. It offers a new strategy for the development of novel carbon nitride materials for efficient photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Spacer Cation Alloying in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskites for Efficient Red Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Precisely Tunable Wavelengths</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and general strategy of spacer cation alloying is developed to modulate the thickness distribution of quantum wells in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskite films. Based on this method, efficient perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak external quantum efficiencies up to 11.5%.








Abstract
Perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have recently shown significant progress with external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) exceeding 20%. However, PeLEDs with pure&#8208;red (620&#8722;660&#160;nm) light emission, an essential part for full&#8208;color displays, remain a great challenge. Herein, a general approach of spacer cation alloying is employed in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPPs) for efficient red PeLEDs with precisely tunable wavelengths. By simply tuning the alloying ratio of dual spacer cations, the thickness distribution of quantum wells in the RPP films can be precisely modulated without deteriorating their charge&#8208;transport ability and energy funneling processes. Consequently, efficient PeLEDs with tunable emissions between pure red (626&#160;nm) and deep red (671&#160;nm) are achieved with peak EQEs up to 11.5%, representing the highest values among RPP&#8208;based pure&#8208;red PeLEDs. This work opens a new route for color tuning, which will spur future developments of pure&#8208;red or even pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs with high performance.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermal Imprinting of Plasmonic Hotspots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Plasmonic heating ordinarily leads to isotropic heating of the material. However, through nanoparticle shaping, pulsed illumination, and the right choice of material (e.g., HfN), plasmonic absorption hotspots can be directly imprinted on the lattice as heat. This approach results in extreme thermal hotspots, lasting hundreds of picoseconds, which can boost the chemical reactivity of catalytic nanoreactors by orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Plasmonic photochemistry is driven by a rich collection of near&#8208;field, hot charge carrier, energy transfer, and thermal effects, most often accomplished by continuous wave illumination. Heat generation is usually considered undesirable, because noble metal nanoparticles heat up isotropically, losing the extreme energy confinement of the optical resonance. Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat&#8208;transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&gt;10 K nm&#8722;1) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano&#8208;photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.

Here it is demonstrated through optical and heat-transfer modelling that the judicious choice of nanoreactor geometry and material enables the direct thermal imprint of plasmonic optical absorption hotspots onto the lattice with high fidelity. Transition metal nitrides (TMNs, e.g., TiN/HfN) embody the ideal material requirements, where ultrafast electron&#8211;phonon coupling prevents fast electronic heat dissipation and low thermal conductivity prolongs the heat confinement. The extreme energy confinement leads to unprecedented peak temperatures and internal heat gradients (&amp;gt;10 K nm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) that cannot be achieved using noble metals or any current heating method. TMN nanoreactors consequently yield up to ten thousand times more product in pulsed photothermal chemical conversion compared with noble metals (Ag, Au, Cu). These findings open up a completely unexplored realm of nano-photochemistry, where adjacent reaction centers experience substantially different temperatures for hundreds of picoseconds, long enough for bond breaking to occur.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Cancer Therapy
In article number 2104037, Xiang Li, Zhen Gu, Xiujun Cai, and co&#8208;workers report that the generated H2S and released zinc ions from ZnS@BSA nanoclusters promote accumulation of reactive oxygen species to activate cGAS/STING signals in tumor cells. ZnS@BSA nanoclusters are further demonstrated to facilitate antitumor immunotherapy by immune cell infiltration, showing potential for clinical translation.

Detection of Neurotransmitters
So far, only modestly performing synthetic binders have been accessible for small bioactive molecules such as serotonin and dopamine. In article number 2104614, Luisa De Cola, Frank Biedermann, and co&#8208;workers introduce zeolite&#8208;based artificial receptors (ZARs), which are microporous inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid materials applicable for the optical&#8208;based detection of serotonin and dopamine in urine at physiological relevant concentrations. These ZARs outperform protein receptors with respect to response times, robustness and scalability.

COVID&#8208;19 Therapy
In their work reported in article number 2103471, Long Zhang, Fangfang Zhou, and co&#8208;workers fuse the S&#8208;palmitoylation&#8208;dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and engineer extracellular vesicles (EVs) on their surface enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs). The PM&#8208;ACE2&#8208;EVs can bind to the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 S&#8208;RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell&#8208;surface ACE2, thereby preventing SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 from entering the host cell. This study provides a novel EV&#8208;based candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID&#8208;19.

&lt;p&gt;In their work reported in article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202103471"&gt;2103471&lt;/a&gt;, Long Zhang, Fangfang Zhou, and co-workers fuse the S-palmitoylation-dependent plasma membrane (PM) targeting sequence with angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and engineer extracellular vesicles (EVs) on their surface enriched with palmitoylated ACE2 (PM-ACE2-EVs). The PM-ACE2-EVs can bind to the SARS-CoV-2 S-RBD with high affinity and block its interaction with cell-surface ACE2, thereby preventing SARS-CoV-2 from entering the host cell. This study provides a novel EV-based candidate for prophylactic and therapeutic treatment against COVID-19.

         <title>Nanophotonic Color Routing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoscale color routing is reviewed with a focus on the emerging concepts and the technology development trend, in particular for the applications in high&#8208;resolution imaging. Nanophotonic methods to manipulate light in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum are presented. The remaining challenges and the potential solutions are also discussed.








Abstract
Recent advances in low&#8208;dimensional materials and nanofabrication technologies have stimulated many breakthroughs in the field of nanophotonics such as metamaterials and plasmonics that provide efficient ways of light manipulation at a subwavelength scale. The representative structure&#8208;induced spectral engineering techniques have demonstrated superior design of freedom compared with natural materials such as pigment/dye. In particular, the emerging spectral routing scheme enables extraordinary light manipulation in both frequency&#8208;domain and spatial&#8208;domain with high&#8208;efficiency utilization of the full spectrum, which is critically important for various applications and may open up entirely new operating paradigms. In this review, a comparative introduction on the operating mechanisms of spectral routing and spectral filtering schemes is given and recent progress on various color nanorouters based on metasurfaces, plasmonics, dielectric antennas is reviewed with a focus on the potential application in high&#8208;resolution imaging. With a thorough analysis and discussion on the advanced properties and drawbacks of various techniques, this report is expected to provide an overview and vision for the future development and application of nanophotonic color (spectral) routing techniques.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts toward hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production are reviewed. In particular, the design of functional groups and the dependence of electrolyte pH play important roles to further improve the selectivity of H2O2 production via the oxygen reduction reaction.








Abstract
Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an environment&#8208;friendly and efficient oxidant with a wide range of applications in different industries. Recently, the production of hydrogen peroxide through direct electrosynthesis has attracted widespread research attention, and has emerged as the most promising method to replace the traditional energy&#8208;intensive multi&#8208;step anthraquinone process. In ongoing efforts to achieve highly efficient large&#8208;scale electrosynthesis of H2O2, carbon&#8208;based materials have been developed as 2e&#8722; oxygen reduction reaction catalysts, with the benefits of low cost, abundant availability, and optimal performance. This review comprehensively introduces the strategies for optimizing carbon&#8208;based materials toward H2O2 production, and the latest advances in carbon&#8208;based hybrid catalysts. The active sites of the carbon&#8208;based materials and the influence of coordination heteroatom doping on the selectivity of H2O2 are extensively analyzed. In particular, the appropriate design of functional groups and understanding the effect of the electrolyte pH are expected to further improve the selective efficiency of producing H2O2 via the oxygen reduction reaction. Methods for improving catalytic activity by interface engineering and reaction kinetics are summarized. Finally, the challenges carbon&#8208;based catalysts face before they can be employed for commercial&#8208;scale H2O2 production are identified, and prospects for designing novel electrochemical reactors are proposed.

         <title>Emerging Technologies in Multi&#8208;Material Bioprinting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi&#8208;material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi&#8208;material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi&#8208;material technologies.








Abstract
Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell&#8208;laden bioinks. However, single&#8208;material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi&#8208;material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi&#8208;cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single&#8208;material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi&#8208;material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom&#8208;designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed.

     alt="Emerging Technologies in Multi-Material Bioprinting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A comprehensive overview of the available 3D bioprinting technologies for fabricating multi-material constructs is presented. The technologies are classified into four major categories, and their advantages and shortcomings are compared. Available multi-material commercial bioprinters are reviewed, concluding with a perspective of the future path for developing multi-material technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bioprinting, within the emerging field of biofabrication, aims at the fabrication of functional biomimetic constructs. Different 3D bioprinting techniques have been adapted to bioprint cell-laden bioinks. However, single-material bioprinting techniques oftentimes fail to reproduce the complex compositions and diversity of native tissues. Multi-material bioprinting as an emerging approach enables the fabrication of heterogeneous multi-cellular constructs that replicate their host microenvironments better than single-material approaches. Here, bioprinting modalities are reviewed, their being adapted to multi-material bioprinting is discussed, and their advantages and challenges, encompassing both custom-designed and commercially available technologies are analyzed. A perspective of how multi-material bioprinting opens up new opportunities for tissue engineering, tissue model engineering, therapeutics development, and personalized medicine is offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Electrochemical Transistors for In Vivo Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The role of organic electrochemical transistors in different in vivo bioelectronic applications, ranging from human electrophysiology to plant interfacing, is discussed. Particular emphasis is given on analyzing the key materials  design and device design aspects that make these devices ideal for addressing future in vivo biological systems. Finally, some challenges, limitations, and future applications are critically assessed.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are presently a focus of intense research and hold great potential in expanding the horizons of the bioelectronics industry. The notable characteristics of OECTs, including their electrolyte&#8208;gating, which offers intimate interfacing with biological environments, and aqueous stability, make them particularly suitable to be operated within a living organism (in vivo). Unlike the existing in vivo bioelectronic devices, mostly based on rigid metal electrodes, OECTs form a soft mechanical contact with the biological milieu and ensure a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio because of their powerful amplification capability. Such features make OECTs particularly desirable for a wide range of in vivo applications, including electrophysiological recordings, neuron stimulation, and neurotransmitter detection, and regulation of plant processes in vivo. In this review, a systematic compilation of the in vivo applications is presented that are addressed by the OECT technology. First, the operating mechanisms, and the device design and materials design principles of OECTs are examined, and then multiple examples are provided from the literature while identifying the unique device properties that enable the application progress. Finally, one critically looks at the future of the OECT technology for in vivo bioelectronic applications.

         <title>Controlled Vertically Aligned Structures in Polymer Composites: Natural Inspiration, Structural Processing, and Functional Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 49, December 9, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in polymer composites with vertically oriented structures is summarized, with an emphasis on natural prototypes, processing methods, and multifunctional applications. Like the fairy tale, the Magpie bridge (processing methods) should be highlighted to connect the gap between the Weaver Girl (natural prototypes of vertical structures) and the Cowherd (functional polymeric composites) for close correlations from inspirations to implementations.








Abstract
Vertically aligned structures, which are a series of characteristic conformations with thickness&#8208;direction alignment, interconnection, or assembly of filler in polymeric composite materials that can provide remarkable structural performance and advanced anisotropic functions, have attracted considerable attention in recent years. The past two decades have witnessed extensive development with regard to universal fabrication methods, subtle control of morphological features, improvement of functional properties, and superior applications of vertically aligned structures in various fields. However, a systematic review remains to be attempted. The various configurations of vertical structures inspired from biological samples in nature, such as vertically aligned structures with honeycomb, reed, annual ring, radial, and lamellar configurations are summarized here. Additionally, relevant processing methods, which include the transformation of oriented direction, external&#8208;field inducement, template method, and 3D printing method, are discussed in detail. The diverse applications in mechanical, thermal, electric, dielectric, electromagnetic, water treatment, and energy fields are also highlighted by providing representative examples. Finally, future opportunities and prospects are listed to identify current issues and potential research directions. It is expected that perspectives on the vertically aligned structures presented here will contribute to the research on advanced multifunctional composites.

         <title>A Low&#8208;cost and Air&#8208;Stable Rechargeable Aluminum&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Rechargeable aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AIBs) are promising for large&#8208;scale energy storage due to the abundant reserve, low cost, and high capacity of Al anode. However, the development of AIBs is currently hindered by the usage of AlCl3/1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium chloride electrolyte, which is expensive, highly corrosive, and extremely air&#8208;sensitive. Herein, we report a new hydrated eutectic electrolyte (HEE) composed of hydrated aluminum perchlorate and succinonitrile for low&#8208;cost, non&#8208;corrosive, and air&#8208;stable AIBs. The crystal water in hydrated aluminum perchlorate plays a vital role in forming the HEE, in which one H2O and five SN and molecules coordinate with one Al3+ ion. The optimized ratio of Al(ClO4)3&#183;9H2O to succinonitrile is 1:12. When combining with the self&#8208;doped polyaniline cathode, the associated AIB delivers a high discharge capacity of 185 mAh g&#8211;1 over 300 cycles; the charge/discharge mechanism in the HEE was studied experimentally and theoretically. The HEE is non&#8208;flammable, air&#8208;stable, and non&#8208;corrosive, thus enabling good air tolerance and facile fabrication of AIBs.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Wicking, Breathable, and Intrinsically Antibacterial Electronic Skin Based on Dual&#8208;Gradient Poly(ionic liquid) Nanofiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gradient poly(ionic liquid) electronic skin with moisture&#8208;wicking, breathable, and antibacterial properties is prepared. Sweat can be delivered to the outside, away from the skin, keeping the electrode&#8208;skin interface dry, ensuring stable and safe collection of bioelectric signals, further enabling real&#8208;time control of a robotic hand. This work provides an unprecedented practical strategy for monitoring and utilization of bioelectrical signals under real conditions.








Abstract
Electronic skin can detect minute electrical potential changes in the human skin and represent the body's state, which is critical for medical diagnostics and human&#8211;computer interface development. On the other hand, sweat has a significant effect on the signal stability, comfort, and safety of electronic skin in a real&#8208;world application. In this study, by modifying the cation and anion of a poly(ionic liquid) (PIL) and employing a spinning process, a PIL&#8208;based multilayer nanofiber membrane (PIL membrane) electronic skin with a dual gradient is created. The PIL electronic skin is moisture&#8208;wicking and breathable due to the hydrophilicity and pore size&#8208;gradients. The intrinsically antimicrobial activities of PILs allow the safe collection of bioelectrical signals from the human body, such as electrocardiography (ECG) and electromyography (EMG). In addition, a robotic hand may be operated in real&#8208;time, and a preliminary human&#8211;computer interface can be accomplished by simple processing of the collected EMG signal. This study establishes a novel practical approach for monitoring and using bioelectrical signals in real&#8208;world circumstances via the multifunctional electronic skin.

         <title>Stretchable Soft Composites with Strain&#8208;Induced Architectured Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Color&#8208;changing composites are manufactured using magnetically aligned coated platelets dispersed in a stretchable polymer matrix. Stretching of such composites enables color change through the strain&#8208;induced rotation of the embedded reflecting platelets. By harnessing the concept of architectured color, the composites feature unique direction&#8208;selective coloration effects that can be exploited in low&#8208;energy optical displays, robotic actuators, and soft tactile sensors.








Abstract
Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low&#8208;power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man&#8208;made color&#8208;changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy intensive. Here, architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input are reported. The orientation&#8208;dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre&#8208;aligned in a well&#8208;defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, composites with strain&#8208;modulated color&#8208;changing effects that cannot be achieved using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art technologies are created. The proposed concept of strain&#8208;induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low&#8208;power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins, and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano&#8208;optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.

     alt="Stretchable Soft Composites with Strain-Induced Architectured Color"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Color-changing composites are manufactured using magnetically aligned coated platelets dispersed in a stretchable polymer matrix. Stretching of such composites enables color change through the strain-induced rotation of the embedded reflecting platelets. By harnessing the concept of architectured color, the composites feature unique direction-selective coloration effects that can be exploited in low-energy optical displays, robotic actuators, and soft tactile sensors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Colors enable interaction and communication between living species in a myriad of biological and artificial environments. While living organisms feature low-power mechanisms to dynamically control color in soft tissues, man-made color-changing devices remain predominantly rigid and energy intensive. Here, architectured composites that display striking color changes when stretched in selective directions under ambient light with minimum power input are reported. The orientation-dependent color change results from the rotation of reflective coated platelets that are embedded in a soft polymer matrix and pre-aligned in a well-defined architecture. The light reflected by the platelets generates structural color defined by the oxide coating on the platelet surface. By magnetically programming the initial orientation and spatial distribution of selected platelets within the soft matrix, composites with strain-modulated color-changing effects that cannot be achieved using state-of-the-art technologies are created. The proposed concept of strain-induced architectured color can be harnessed to develop low-power smart stretchable displays, tactile synthetic skins, and autonomous soft robotic devices that undergo fast and reversible color changes through the mechano-optic coupling programmed within their soft composite architecture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Lattice Orientation Heredity in the Transformation of 2D Epitaxial Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lattice orientation heredity is shown to be a universal strategy in the transformation of highly oriented 2D van der Waals layered and nonlayered thin films. Different from the classical and direct epitaxial deposition, this process is developed based on the heredity phenomena in material science. It opens a new window for growing textured films on disordered substrates (e.g., GaN&#8208;related technology), and provides an effective route for large&#8208;area growth of epitaxial 2D MoS2 thin films.








Abstract
The ability to control lattice orientation is often an essential requirement in the growth of both 2D van der Waals (vdW) layered and nonlayered thin films. Here, a unique and universal phenomenon termed &#8220;lattice orientation heredity&#8221; (LOH) is reported. LOH enables product films (including 2D&#8208;layered materials) to inherit the lattice orientation from reactant films in a chemical conversion process, excluding the requirement on the substrate lattice order. The process universality is demonstrated by investigating the lattice transformations in the carbonization, nitridation, and sulfurization of epitaxial MoO2, ZnO, and In2O3 thin films. Their resultant compounds all inherit the mono&#8208;oriented crystal feature from their precursor oxides, including 2D vdW&#8208;layered semiconductors (e.g., MoS2), metallic films (e.g., MXene&#8208;like Mo2C and MoN), wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors (e.g., hexagonal ZnS), and ferroelectric semiconductors (e.g., In2S3). Using LOH&#8208;grown MoN as a seeding layer, mono&#8208;oriented GaN is achieved on an amorphous quartz substrate. The LOH process presents a universal strategy capable of growing epitaxial thin films (including 2D vdW&#8208;layered materials) not only on single&#8208;crystalline but also on noncrystalline substrates.

         <title>Controlled Deposition of Zinc&#8208;Metal Anodes via Selectively Polarized Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A thin ferroelectric polymer (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) film is constructed on a zinc&#8208;metal anode as a surface protective layer. After selective polarization, such a protective layer could enable a locally concentrated zinc&#8208;ion distribution along the coated surface, and thus induce zinc to grow into horizontally aligned plates. Highly stable zinc batteries are achieved via such modified zinc anodes.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are regarded as ideal candidates for stationary energy&#8208;storage systems due to their low cost and high safety. However, zinc can readily grow into dendrites, leading to limited cycling performance and quick failure of the batteries. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to mitigate this dendrite problem, in which a selectively polarized ferroelectric polymer material (poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE))) is employed as a surface protective layer on zinc anodes. Such a polarized ferroelectric polymer layer can enable a locally concentrated zinc&#8208;ion distribution along the coated surface and thus enable the horizontal growth of zinc plates. As a result, symmetrical zinc batteries using such anodes exhibit long cycling lifespan at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 0.2 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 2000 h, and a high rate performance up to 15&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Also, the full cell (including a Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery and a zinc&#8208;ion capacitor) based on this anode is demonstrated. This work provides a novel strategy to protect the zinc anode and even other metal anodes exploiting polymer ferroelectricity.

         <title>Tailored Double Emulsions Made Simple</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple method is developed to produce double emulsions of a single core and a thin shell at a milliliter per minute production rate, requiring minimal instrumentation, cost, and expertise. This two&#8208;step emulsification technique offers control of shell thickness, diversity of liquid formulations, integration with microfluidic devices, and potential to scale&#8208;up.








Abstract
Double emulsions, such as water&#8208;in&#8208;oil&#8208;in&#8208;water droplets, are important material platforms for conducting fundamental research and for technological applications. To date, well&#8208;defined double&#8208;emulsion droplets consisting of a single water core and a thin oil shell can be exclusively formed with sophisticated microfluidic devices. The fabrication, preparation, and operation of such devices is challenging, which reduces the availability of tailored double emulsions to a limited community of experts. Here, a simple method is introduced to produce single&#8208;core double emulsions with high yield in large quantities, using a vortex mixer. Utilizing the density difference between the dispersed droplet and the continuous phase, this two&#8208;step emulsification method can achieve very small core droplet diameters below 10 &#956;m and ultrathin shells with thicknesses below 1 &#956;m. A detailed picture of the formation mechanism is provided and it is demonstrated that the process can be extended to produce multishell and multicore emulsions. Finally, its application is demonstrated to produce structurally colored colloidal supraparticles with unprecedented uniformity and yield. The method allows the creation of tailored double emulsions with minimal time, cost, effort, and expertise, and may widen its application to nonspecialized scientific communities.

         <title>Tailoring Interlayer Spacers for Efficient and Stable Formamidinium&#8208;Based Low&#8208;Dimensional Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the flexible monovalent spacer cations are introduced into the formamidinium&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, which effectively alleviates lattice distortion and reduce crystal defects. The resultant perovskite films possess desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states, and improved charge transport capability, which delivers highly efficient and thermostable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
2D Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite solar cells generally show mediocre device performances as they are restrained by their defective film quality. The rigid diammonium organic interlayer spacers are intolerant to lattice mismatches, which induces defects and distortions and ultimately deteriorates the optoelectronic properties. Herein, a secondary interlayer spacer is introduced into formamidinium (FA)&#8208;based low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, which substantially improves the film quality. The flexible monovalent spacer cations effectively alleviate lattice distortions and reduce crystal defects, providing perovskite films with desirable microscopic morphology, preferable crystal orientation, reduced defect states, and improved charge transport capability. As a result, the optimized perovskite solar cell based on the (PDA0.9PA0.2)(FA)3Pb4I13 (PDA = propane&#8208;1,3&#8208;diammonium, PA = propylammonium) film exhibits the exceptional power conversion efficiency of 16.0%, the highest reported value in its class. In addition, the device demonstrates the enhanced thermal stability, retaining 90% of its initial efficiency after aging at 85&#160;&#176;C for 800 h.

         <title>Unravelling the Mechanism of Intermediate&#8208;Temperature CO2 Interaction with Molten&#8208;NaNO3&#8208;Salt&#8208;Promoted MgO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The use of 18O2 verifies the proposed theoretical reaction path: conversion of NO3&#8722; to NO2+ followed by adsorption on MgO, causing significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength and formation of [Mg2+&#8230; O2&#8722;] ion pairs. This prevents the presence of impermeable MgCO3 shell which increases the rate of MgO carbonation to a significantly greater extent compared to the unpromoted MgO.








Abstract
The optimization of MgO&#8208;based adsorbents as advanced CO2&#8208;capture materials is predominantly focused on their molten&#8208;salt modification, for which theoretical and experimental contributions provide great insights for their high CO2&#8208;capture performance. The underlying mechanism of the promotion effect of the molten salt on CO2 capture, however, is a topic of controversy. Herein, advanced experimental characterization techniques, including in situ environmental transmission electron microscopy (eTEM) and CO2 chemisorption by diffuse&#8208;reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS), transient 18O&#8208;isotopic exchange, and density functional theory (DFT), are employed to elucidate the mechanism of the CO2 interaction with molten&#8208;salt&#8208;modified MgO in the 250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C range. Herein, eTEM studies using low (2&#8211;3 mbar) and high (700 mbar) CO2 pressures illustrate the dynamic evolution of the molten NaNO3 salt promoted and unpromoted MgO carbonation with high magnification (&lt;50&#160;nm). The formation of 18O&#8208;NaNO3 (use of 18O2) and C16O18O following CO2 interaction, verifies the proposed reaction path: conversion of NO3&#8722; (NO3&#8722;&#160;&#8594; NO2+&#160;+ O2&#8211;), adsorption of NO2+ on MgO with significant weakening of CO2 adsorption strength, and formation of [Mg2+&#8230; O2&#8722;] ion pairs preventing the development of an impermeable MgCO3 shell, which largely increases the rate of bulk MgO carbonation.

         <title>Mechanically Durable Memristor Arrays Based on a Discrete Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable memristor with mechanical damage endurance is developed based on a discrete structure design. The discrete&#8208;structure&#8208;based memristor exhibits large stretchability (&#8776;40%) and stable performance under various mechanical deformations. Moreover, the device possesses excellent tolerance against adverse mechanical damage, including puncture and tearing, while retaining reliable functions.








Abstract
Memristors constitute a promising functional component for information storage and in&#8208;memory computing in flexible and stretchable electronics including wearable devices, prosthetics, and soft robotics. Despite tremendous efforts made to adapt conventional rigid memristors to flexible and stretchable scenarios, stretchable and mechanical&#8208;damage&#8208;endurable memristors, which are critical for maintaining reliable functions under unexpected mechanical attack, have never been achieved. Here, the development of stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance based on a discrete structure design is reported. The memristors possess large stretchability (40%) and excellent deformability (half&#8208;fold), and retain stable performances under dynamic stretching and releasing. It is shown that the memristors maintain reliable functions and preserve information after extreme mechanical damage, including puncture (up to 100 times) and serious tearing situations (fully diagonally cut). The structural strategy offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation stretchable memristors with mechanical damage endurance, which is vital to achieve reliable functions for flexible and stretchable electronics even in extreme and highly dynamic environments.

         <title>Tackling Humidity with Designer Ionic Liquid&#8208;Based Gas Sensing Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Relative humidity (RH) is simultaneously a desired sensing target and an undesired contaminant for gas and volatile organic compound (VOC) sensing systems. Existing gas and VOC sensors are sensitive to water and thus strategies to control humidity interference before or after the sensing materials are required. An unmet challenge is the creation of gas sensitive materials where the response to humidity is controlled by the material itself.
Here, humidity effects are controlled through the design of gelatin formulations in ionic liquids without (ionomaterials) and with liquid crystal (hybrid materials) as electrical and optical sensors, respectively. In this design, the anions [DCA]&#8722; and [Cl]&#8722; of room temperature ionic liquids from the 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium family tailor the response to humidity and subsequently the possibility to sense VOCs in dry and humid conditions. Due to the combined effect of the materials formulations and sensing mechanisms, changing the anion from [DCA]&#8722; to the much more hygroscopic [Cl]&#8722;, leads to stronger electrical responses and much weaker optical responses to humidity. Thus, we obtain either humidity sensors or humidity&#8208;tolerant VOC sensors that do not require sample pre&#8208;conditioning or signal processing for correction of humidity impact. With the widespread of 3 and 4D&#8208;printing and intelligent devices, the possibility to monitor and tune humidity in sustainable bio&#8208;based materials offers excellent opportunities in e&#8208;nose sensing arrays and wearable devices compatible with operation at room conditions.

         <title>Commensurate Stacking Phase Transitions in an Intercalated Transition Metal Dichalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intercalation and stacking order modulation are two active ways in manipulating the interlayer interaction of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), which lead to a variety of emergent phases and allow for engineering material properties. Herein, the growth of Pb intercalated TMDCs&#8211;Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2, the first 124&#8208;phase, is reported. Pb(Ta1+xSe2)2 exhibits a unique two&#8208;step first&#8208;order structural phase transition at around 230 K. The transitions are solely associated with the stacking degree of freedom, evolving from a high temperature phase with ABC stacking and symmetry R3m to an intermediate phase with AB stacking and P3m1, and finally to a low temperature phase with again symmetry R3m, but with ACB stacking. Each step involves a rigid slide of building blocks by a vector [1/3, 2/3, 0]. Intriguingly, gigantic lattice contractions occur at the transitions on warming. At low temperature, bulk superconductivity with Tc &#8776; 1.8 K is observed. The underlying physics of the structural phase transitions are discussed from first&#8208;principle calculations. The symmetry analysis reveals topological nodal lines in the band structure. Our results demonstrate the possibility to realize higher order metal intercalated phases of TMDCs, advance our knowledge of polymorphic transitions and may inspire stacking order engineering in TMDCs and&#160;beyond.

         <title>Programmable Matter: The Nanoparticle Atom and DNA Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal crystal engineering with DNA has led to significant advances in bottom&#8208;up materials synthesis and a new way of thinking about fundamental concepts in chemistry. Here, programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), comprised of nanoparticles (the &#8220;atoms&#8221;) functionalized with DNA (the &#8220;bonding elements&#8221;), are assembled through DNA hybridization into crystalline lattices. Unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (e.g., the nanoparticle shape, size, and composition) and the &#8220;bond&#8221; (e.g., the DNA length and sequence) can be tuned independently, yielding designer materials with unique catalytic, optical, and biological properties. In this review, nearly three decades of work that have contributed to the evolution of this class of programmable matter is chronicled, starting from the earliest examples based on gold&#8208;core PAEs, and then delineating how advances in synthetic capabilities, DNA design, and fundamental understanding of PAE&#8208;PAE interactions have led to new classes of functional materials that, in several cases, have no natural equivalent.

Here, programmable atom equivalents (PAEs), comprised of nanoparticles (the &#8220;atoms&#8221;) functionalized with DNA (the &#8220;bonding elements&#8221;), are assembled through DNA hybridization into crystalline lattices. Unlike atomic systems, the &#8220;atom&#8221; (e.g., the nanoparticle shape, size, and composition) and the &#8220;bond&#8221; (e.g., the DNA length and sequence) can be tuned independently, yielding designer materials with unique catalytic, optical, and biological properties. In this review, nearly three decades of work that have contributed to the evolution of this class of programmable matter is chronicled, starting from the earliest examples based on gold-core PAEs, and then delineating how advances in synthetic capabilities, DNA design, and fundamental understanding of PAE-PAE interactions have led to new classes of functional materials that, in several cases, have no natural equivalent.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D Continuously Porous Graphene for Energy Applications</title>

Abstract
Constructing bulk graphene materials with well&#8208;reserved 2D properties is essential for device and engineering applications of atomically thick graphene. In this article we review the recent progress in the fabrications and applications of sterically continuous porous graphene with designable microstructures, chemistries and properties for energy storage and conversion. Both template&#8208;based and template&#8208;free methods have been developed to synthesize the 3D continuously porous graphene, which typically has the microstructure reminiscent of pseudo&#8208;periodic minimal surfaces. The 3D graphene can well preserve the properties of 2D graphene of being highly conductive, surface abundant, and mechanically robust, together with unique 2D electronic behaviors. Additionally, the bicontinuous porosity and large curvature offer new functionalities, such as rapid mass transport, ample open space, mechanical flexibility, and tunable electric/thermal conductivity. Particularly, the 3D curvature provides a new degree of freedom for tailoring the catalysis and transport properties of graphene. The 3D graphene with those extraordinary properties have shown great promises for a wide range of applications, especially for energy conversion and storage. This article overviews the recent advances made in addressing the challenges of developing 3D continuously porous graphene, the benefits and opportunities of the new materials for energy&#8208;related applications, and the remaining challenges that warrant future study.

         <title>Nanostructure Control in 3D Printed Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation is applied to 3D printing using a robust and rapid photoinitiated RAFT polymerization process. The resulting materials display sub&#8208;10&#160;nm features that are controllable through the choice of resin components and provide enhanced mechanical properties. This process is a new highly accessible route to nanoscale structured materials.








Abstract
Currently, there are no straightforward methods to 3D print materials with nanoscale control over morphological and functional properties. Here, a novel approach for the fabrication of materials with controlled nanoscale morphologies using a rapid and commercially available Digital Light Processing 3D printing technique is demonstrated. This process exploits reversible deactivation radical polymerization to control the in&#8208;situ&#8208;polymerization&#8208;induced microphase separation of 3D printing resins, which provides materials with complex architectures controllable from the macro&#8208; to nanoscale, resulting in the preparation of materials with enhanced mechanical properties. This method does not require specialized equipment or process conditions and thus represents an important development in the production of advanced materials via additive manufacturing.

         <title>POM Anolyte for All&#8208;anion Redox Flow Batteries with High Capacity Retention and Coulombic Efficiency at Mild pH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly soluble and stable Li5BW12O40 cluster delivers 2 e&#8722; redox reaction with fast electron transfer rates (2.5 * 10&#8722;2&#160;cm s&#8722;1) and high diffusion coefficients (&#8764;2.08 * 10&#8722;6 cm2 s&#8722;1) at mild pH ranging from 3 to 8. In&#8208;operando aqueous&#8208;flowing Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations reveals that Raman shift changing of {BW12} clusters should be due to the bond length changing between W&#8208;Ob&#8208;W and W&#8208;Oc&#8208;W at different redox states of clusters. All above structure changing and redox chemistry of Li5BW12O40 are highly reversible, which makes the Li5BW12O40 cluster versatile to construct all&#8208;anion aqueous redox flow batteries at different pH. The cation&#8208;exchange Nafion membrane will also repel the cross permeability of the anion redox couples. As a result, by coupling with Li3K[Fe(CN)6] catholyte, the aqueous RFB can be operated at pH 8 with a capacity retention up to 95% and an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) more than 99.79% over 300 cycles within the voltage window ranging from 0 to 1.2&#160;V. Meanwhile, Li5BW12O40 cluster can also be paired with LiI catholyte to form aqueous RFBs at pH 7 and pH 3, the capacity retention of 94% and 90% can be realized over 300 cycles within 0 to 1.3&#160;V.

         <title>Continuous Energy Harvesting from Ubiquitous Humidity Gradients using Liquid&#8208;Infused Nanofluidics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Humidity gradients surrounding sweating surfaces can continuously output electric energy when integrated with ionic liquid (IL)&#8208;infused nanofluidics, which is attributed to the nanoconfined IL that integrates van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to block movement of Omim+ clusters while allowing for directional transmembrane diffusion of moisture&#8208;liberated Cl&#8722;.








Abstract
Humidity&#8208;based power generation that converts internal energy of water molecules into electricity is an emerging approach for harvesting clean energy from nature. Here it is proposed that intrinsic gradient within a humidity field near sweating surfaces, such as rivers, soil, or animal skin, is a promising power resource when integrated with liquid&#8208;infused nanofluidics. Specifically, capillary&#8208;stabilized ionic liquid (IL, Omim+Cl&#8208;) film is exposed to the above humidity field to create a sustained transmembrane water&#8208;content difference, which enables asymmetric ion&#8208;diffusion across the nanoconfined fluidics, facilitating long&#8208;term electricity generation with the power density of &#8776;12.11 &#181;W cm&#8208;2. This high record is attributed to the nanoconfined IL that integrates van der Waals and electrostatic interactions to block movement of Omim+ clusters while allowing for directional diffusion of moisture&#8208;liberated Cl+. This humidity gradient triggers large ion&#8208;diffusion flux for power generation indicates great potential of sweating surfaces considering that most of the earth is covered by water or soil.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Oriented Antibody&#8208;Decorated Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Nanocrystals for Active Targeting Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Antibody (Ab)&#8208;targeted nanoparticles are becoming increasingly important for precision medicine. By controlling the Ab orientation, targeting properties can be enhanced; however, to afford such an ordered configuration, cumbersome chemical functionalization protocols are usually required. This aspect limits the progress of Abs&#8208;nanoparticles toward nano&#8208;medicine translation. Herein, a novel one&#8208;step synthesis of oriented monoclonal Ab&#8208;decorated metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanocrystals is presented. The crystallization of a zinc&#8208;based MOF, Zn2(mIM)2(CO3), from a solution of Zn2+ and 2&#8208;methylimidazole, is triggered by the fragment crystallizable (Fc) region of the Ab. This selective growth yields biocomposites with oriented Abs on the MOF nanocrystals (MOF*Ab): the Fc regions are partially inserted within the MOF surface and the antibody&#8208;binding regions protrude from the MOF surface towards the target. This ordered configuration imparts antibody&#8208;antigen recognition properties to the biocomposite and shows preserved target binding when compared to the parental antibodies. Next, the biosensing performance of the system was tested by loading MOF*Ab with luminescent quantum dots. The targeting efficiency of the QD&#8208;containing MOF*Ab is, again, fully preserved. The present work reports a simple self&#8208;assembly approach for the fabrication of antibody&#8208;decorated MOF nanocrystals with broad potential for sensing, diagnostic imaging, and targeted drug delivery.

The present work reports a simple self-assembly approach for the fabrication of antibody-decorated MOF nanocrystals with broad potential for sensing, diagnostic imaging, and targeted drug delivery.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Conductivity mechanism in ionic 2D carbon nitrides: from hydrated ion motion to enhanced photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Carbon nitrides are among the most studied materials for photocatalysis, however, limitations arise from inefficient charge separation and transport within the material. Here, this aspect is addressed in the 2D carbon nitride poly(heptazine imide) (PHI) by investigating the influence of various counterions, such as M = Li+, Na+, K+, Cs+, Ba2+, NH4+ and tetramethyl ammonium, on the material's conductivity and photocatalytic activity. These ions in the PHI pores affect the stacking of the 2D layers, which further influences the predominantly ionic conductivity in M&#8208;PHI. Na&#8208;containing PHI outperforms the other M&#8208;PHI in various relative humidity (RH) environments (0&#8208;42%RH) in terms of conductivity, likely due to pore channel geometry and size of the (hydrated) ion. With increasing RH, the ionic conductivity increases by 4&#8211;5 orders of magnitude (for Na&#8208;PHI up to 10&#8211;5 S cm&#8211;1 at 42%RH). At the same time, the highest photocatalytic hydrogen evolution rate is observed for Na&#8208;PHI, which is mirrored by increased photo&#8208;generated charge carrier lifetimes, pointing to efficient charge carrier stabilization by, e.g., mobile ions. These results indicate that also ionic conductivity is an important parameter that can influence the photocatalytic activity. Besides, RH&#8208;dependent ionic conductivity is of high interest for separators, membranes, or sensors.

         <title>Advancing the Mechanical Performance of Glasses: Perspectives and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Glasses are materials that lack a crystalline microstructure and long&#8208;range atomic order. Instead, they feature heterogeneity and disorder on superstructural scales, which have profound consequences for their elastic response, material strength, fracture toughness and the characteristics of dynamic fracture. These structure&#8208;property relations present a rich field of study in fundamental glass physics and are also becoming increasingly important in the design of modern materials with improved mechanical performance. A first step in this direction involves glass&#8208;like materials that retain optical transparency and the haptics of classical glass products, while overcoming the limitations of brittleness. Among these, novel types of oxide glasses, hybrid glasses, phase&#8208;separated glasses and bioinspired glass&#8208;polymer composites hold significant promise. Such materials are designed from the bottom&#8208;up, building on structure&#8208;property relations, modeling of stresses and strains at relevant length scales, and machine learning predictions. Their fabrication requires a more scientifically driven approach to materials design and processing, building on the physics of structural disorder and its consequences for structural rearrangements, defect initiation and dynamic fracture in response to mechanical load. In this article, we provide a perspective on this highly interdisciplinary field of research in terms of its most recent challenges and opportunities.

         <title>In situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultra&#8208;long cycling life have always been the constant pursuit of rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Herein, a facile strategy has been employed to successfully synthesize the porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose electroactive surfaces to electrolyte, which is favorable for ultra&#8208;fast sodium ions storage. In addition, the carbon fiber cloth (CFC) provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides inherent flexibility of CFC, the integration of hierarchical structures of CoxP with CFC as well as the strong synergistic effect between them do effectively help buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structure integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as anode has shown a record high capacity of 279 mAh/g at 5.0 A/g with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <title>Inorganic&#8208;Cation Pseudo&#8208;Halide Two&#8208;dimensional Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 Perovskite Single Crystal</title>

Abstract
Various layered lead halide perovskites based on the Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) structure with the general formula of An+1BnX3n+1 (n = 1, 2, &#8230;) have been developed. Most of them are comprised of alternating layered perovskite&#8208;like stacks and an organic spacer with a long insulating chain especially for the A&#8208;site&#8208;substituted RP&#8208;type perovskites. To date, only a small number of layered X&#8208;site&#8208;substituted two&#8208;dimensional (2D) RP type perovskites are reported. Herein, we report the first inorganic&#8208;cation pseudo&#8208;halide 2D phase perovskite single crystal, Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2. It was synthesized by the anti&#8208;solvent vapor assisted crystallization (AVC) method, and exhibits a standard single&#8208;layer (n = 1) Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper structure described in space group of Pmmn (#59) and has a small separation (d = 1.69 &#197;) between the perovskite sheets. Notably, the SCN&#8211; anions are found to bend the 2D Pb(SCN)2Br2 framework slightly into a kite&#8208;shaped octahedron, limiting the formation of a quasi&#8208;2D perovskite structure (n &gt;1).&#160;Surprisingly, this 2D single crystal exhibits a reversible first&#8208;order phase transformation to 3D CsPbBr3 (Pm3m #221) at 450 K. The Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 single crystal exhibits a very low exciton binding energy of 160 meV, as measured by temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence (PL), which is one of the lowest values reported for 2D perovskites (n = 1) and is comparable to the binding energies of quasi&#8208;2D RP&#8208;phase perovskites. A photodetector based on Cs2Pb(SCN)2Br2 single crystal is demonstrated with a responsivity of 8.46&#160;mA W&#8211;1 and detectivity of &#8764;1.2 x 1010 Jones requiring a low bias voltage of only 0.5&#160;V.

         <title>Strain Engineering of Low&#8208;dimensional Materials for Emerging Quantum Phenomena and Functionalities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron&#8208;electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. In this Review, we highlight recent advances in strain&#8208;tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low&#8208;dimensional quantum materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent discoveries of exotic physical phenomena, such as unconventional superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene, dissipationless Dirac fermions in topological insulators, and quantum spin liquids, have triggered tremendous interest in quantum materials. The macroscopic revelation of quantum mechanical effects in quantum materials is associated with strong electron-electron correlations in the lattice, particularly where materials have reduced dimensionality. Owing to the strong correlations and confined geometry, altering atomic spacing and crystal symmetry via strain has emerged as an effective and versatile pathway for perturbing the subtle equilibrium of quantum states. In this Review, we highlight recent advances in strain-tunable quantum phenomena and functionalities, with particular focus on low-dimensional quantum materials. Experimental strategies for strain engineering are first discussed in terms of heterogeneity and elastic reconfigurability of strain distribution. The nontrivial quantum properties of several strain-quantum coupled platforms, including two-dimensional van der Waals materials and heterostructures, topological insulators, superconducting oxides, and metal halide perovskites, are next outlined, with current challenges and future opportunities in quantum straintronics followed. Overall, strain engineering of quantum phenomena and functionalities is a rich field for fundamental research of many-body interactions and holds substantial promise for next-generation electronics capable of ultrafast, dissipationless, and secure information processing and communications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Future&#8208;oriented Advanced Diarylethene Photoswitches: From Molecular Design to Spontaneous Assembly Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diarylethene (DAE) photoswitch is a new and promising family of photochromic molecules and has shown superior performance as a smart trigger in stimulus&#8208;responsive materials. During the past few decades, the DAE family has achieved a leap from simple molecules to functional molecules and developed toward validity as a universal switching building block. In recent years, the introduction of DAE into an assembly system is an attractive strategy that enables the photochromic behavior of the building blocks to be manifested at the level of the entire system, beyond the DAE unit itself. This assembly&#8208;based strategy will bring many unexpected results that promoting the design and manufacture of a new generation of advanced materials. This review summarizes recent advances in the design and fabrication of diarylethene as a trigger in materials science, chemistry, and biomedicine.

         <title>Photosensitizer Nanodot Eliciting Immunogenicity for Photo&#8208;Immunologic Therapy of Postoperative Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus Infection and Secondary Recurrence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The treatment of postoperative infection caused by multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria, such as methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), has become an intractable clinical challenge owing to its low therapeutic efficacy and high risk of recurrence. Apart from imperfect antibacterial therapies, induction of insufficient immunogenicity required for the successful clearance of a pathogen may also contribute to the problem. Herein, we utilized an ultra&#8208;micro photosensitizer, AgB nanodots, using photothermal therapy, photodynamic therapy, and Ag+ ion sterilization to efficiently clear invading MRSA both in vitro and in vivo. AgB nanodots were also found to upregulate host immunogenicity in a murine model and establish immunological memory by promoting the upregulated expression of danger signals that are commonly induced by stress&#8208;related responses, including sudden temperature spikes or excess reactive oxygen production. These stimulations boost the antibacterial effects of macrophages, dendritic cells, T cells, or even memory B cells, which is usually defined as infection&#8208;related immunogenic cell death. Hence, the proposed AgB nanodot strategy may offer a novel platform for the effective treatment of postoperative infection while providing a systematic immunotherapeutic strategy to combat persistent infections, thereby markedly reducing the incidence of recurrence following recovery from primary infections.

         <title>Surface Passivation Using Two Dimensional Perovskites Towards Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have shown great promise for use in next&#8208;generation photovoltaic devices. However, some challenges need to be addressed before their commercial production, such as enormous defects formed on the surface, which result in severe SRH recombination, and inadequate material interplay between the composition, leading to thermal&#8208;, moisture&#8208;, and light&#8208;induced degradation. 2D perovskites, in which the organic layer functions as a protective barrier to block the erosion of moisture or ions, have recently emerged and attracted increasing attention because they exhibit significant robustness. Inspired by this, surface passivation by employing 2D perovskites deposited on the top of 3D counterparts has triggered a new wave of research to simultaneously achieve higher efficiency and stability. Herein, we exploited a vast amount of literature to comprehensively summarize the recent progress on 2D/3D heterostructure PSCs using surface passivation. The review begins with an introduction of the crystal structure, followed by the advantages of the combination of 2D and 3D perovskites. Then, the surface passivation strategies, optoelectronic properties, enhanced stability, and photovoltaic performance of 2D/3D PSCs are systematically discussed. Finally, we propose the perspectives of passivation techniques using 2D perovskites to offer insight into further improved photovoltaic performance in the future.

         <title>Oriented 2D Perovskite Wafers for Anisotropic X&#8208;ray Detection Through Fast Tableting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional perovskite single crystals have emerged as excellent optoelectronic materials owing to their unique anisotropic properties. However, growing large 2D perovskite single crystals remains challenging and time&#8208;consuming. Here, we report a new composition of lead&#8208;free 2D perovskite&#8212;4&#8208;fluorophenethylammonium bismuth iodide [(F&#8208;PEA)3BiI6]. An oriented bulk 2D material with a large area of 1.33 cm2 was obtained by tableting disordered 2D perovskite powders under a pressure of 280&#160;MPa, resulting in different anisotropy resistivities of 5 &#215; 1010 and 2 &#215; 1011 &#937;&#183;cm in the lateral and vertical directions, respectively. This four&#8208;fold conductivity difference of the large&#8208;area wafer is already comparable to that of 2D perovskite single crystals. Trivalent Bi3+ ions were employed to achieve a stronger ionic bonding energy with I&#8211; ions, which intrinsically suppressed the ion migration effect. Thus, the oriented wafer presented good capabilities in both charge collection and ion migration suppression under a large applied bias along the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane direction, making it suitable for low&#8208;dosage X&#8208;ray detection. The large&#8208;area wafer showed a sensitive response to hard X&#8208;rays operated at a tube voltage of 120 kVp with the lowest detectable dose rate of 30 nGy&#183;s&#8211;1. Thus, the fast tableting process is a facile and effective strategy to synthesize large&#8208;area, oriented 2D wafers, showing excellent X&#8208;ray detection performance and operational stability that are comparable to those of 2D perovskite single crystals.

         <title>Guiding Transition Metal&#8208;Doped Hollow Cerium Tandem Nanozymes with Elaborately Regulated Multi&#8208;Enzymatic Activities for Intensive Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Clinical applications of nanozyme&#8208;initiated chemodynamic therapy (NCDT) have been severely limited by the poor catalytic efficiency of nanozymes, insufficient endogenous H2O2 content, and off&#8208;target consumption of H2O2. Herein, we developed a hollow mesoporous Mn/Zr&#8208;co&#8208;doped CeO2 tandem nanozyme (PHMZCO&#8208;AT) with regulated multi&#8208;enzymatic activities, i.e., the enhancement of superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like and peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activities and inhibition of catalase (CAT)&#8208;like activity. PHMZCO&#8208;AT as a H2O2 homeostasis disruptor promotes H2O2 evolution and restrains off&#8208;target elimination of H2O2 to achieve intensive NCDT. PHMZCO&#8208;AT with SOD&#8208;like activity catalyzes endogenous O2&#183;&#8211; into H2O2 in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO&#8208;AT largely weaken the off&#8208;target decomposition of H2O2 to H2O. Elevated H2O2 is then catalyzed by the downstream POD&#8208;like activity of PHMZCO&#8208;AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X&#8208;ray computed tomography imaging were also achieved using PHMZCO&#8208;AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn2+ and the high X&#8208;ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a powerful paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by simultaneously regulating multi&#8208;enzymatic activities of Ce&#8208;based nanozyme and perturbing the H2O2 homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment.

PHMZCO-AT with SOD-like activity catalyzes endogenous O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; into H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the tumor region. The suppression of CAT activity and depletion of glutathione by PHMZCO-AT largely weaken the off-target decomposition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Elevated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is then catalyzed by the downstream POD-like activity of PHMZCO-AT to generate toxic hydroxyl radicals, further inducing tumor apoptosis and death. &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and X-ray computed tomography imaging were also achieved using PHMZCO-AT due to the existence of paramagnetic Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and the high X-ray attenuation ability of elemental Zr, permitting in vivo tracking of the therapeutic process. This work presents a powerful paradigm to achieve intensive NCDT efficacy by simultaneously regulating multi-enzymatic activities of Ce-based nanozyme and perturbing the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; homeostasis in the tumor microenvironment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Auxetics&#8208;Inspired Tunable Metamaterials for Magnetic Resonance Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Auxetics refers to structures or materials with a negative Poisson's ratio, thereby capable of exhibiting counter&#8208;intuitive behaviors. Herein, auxetic structures are exploited to design mechanically tunable metamaterials in both planar and hemispherical configurations operating at megahertz (MHz) frequencies, optimized for their application to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specially, the reported tunable metamaterials are composed of arrays of inter&#8208;jointed unit cells featuring metallic helices, enabling auxetic patterns with a negative Poisson's ratio. The deployable deformation of the metamaterials yields an added degree of freedom with respect to frequency tunability through the resultant modification of the electromagnetic interactions between unit cells. The metamaterials are fabricated using 3D printing technology and a &#8764;20&#160;MHz frequency shift of the resonance mode is enabled during deformation. Experimental validation is performed in a clinical (3.0 Tesla) MRI, demonstrating that the metamaterials enable a marked boost in radiofrequency (RF) field strength under resonance matched conditions, ultimately yielding a dramatic increase in the signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) (&#8764; 4.5X) of MRI. The tunable metamaterials presented herein offer a novel pathway towards the practical utilization of metamaterials in MRI, as well as a range of other emerging applications.

         <title>Biocompatible Vibration&#8208;Actuated Omni&#8208;Droplets Rectifier with Large Volume Range Fabricated by Femtosecond Laser</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance droplet transport is crucial for diverse applications such as biomedical detection, chemical micro&#8208;reaction, and droplet microfluidics. Despite extensive progresses, traditional passive strategies and active strategies are restricted to limited liquid types, small droplet volume ranges, and poor biocompatibilities. Moreover, more challenges occur for the biological fluids due to the large viscosity and low surface tension. Here we report a vibration&#8208;actuated omni&#8208;droplets rectifier (VAODR) consisting of slippery ratchets arrays fabricated by femtosecond laser and vibration platforms. Through the relative competition between the asymmetric adhesive resistance originating from the lubricant meniscus on VAODR and the periodic inertial driving force originating from isotropic vibration, the fast (up to &#8764;60&#160;mm/s), programmable and robust transport of droplets are achieved for a large volume range (0.05&#8208;2,000&#160;&#956;L, Vmax/Vmin &#8764;40,000) and in various transport modes including liquid slugs transport in the VAODR&#8208;based tube, programmable and sequential transport, and &#8220;cable&#8208;car&#8221;&#8208;like bidirectional transport. Our VAODR is also general to a high diversity of biological and medical fluids, and thus can be used for the biomedical detection such as ABO blood group test and anti&#8208;cancer drugs screening. Our strategies provide a complementary and promising platform for maneuvering omni&#8208;droplets that are fundamental to biomedical applications as well as other high&#8208;throughput omni&#8208;droplet operation fields.

         <title>An Asymmetry Field&#8208;Effect Phototransistor for Solving Large Exciton Binding Energy of 2D TMDCs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The probing of fundamental photophysics is a key prerequisite for the construction of diverse optoelectronic devices and circuits. To date, though, photocarrier dynamics in two&#8208;dimensional materials remains unclear, plagued primarily by two issues: a large exciton binding energy, and the lack of a suitable system that enables the manipulation of excitons. Here, we demonstrate a WSe2&#8208;based phototransistor with an asymmetric split&#8208;gate configuration, which we name the asymmetry field&#8208;effect phototransistor (AFEPT). This structure allows for the effective modulation of the electric field profile across the channel, thereby providing a standard device platform for exploring the photocarrier dynamics of the intrinsic WSe2 layer. By controlling the electric field, we observed in this work the spatial evolution of the photocurrent, notably with a strong signal over the entire WSe2 channel. Using photocurrent and optical spectroscopy measurements, we clarified the physical origin of the novel photocurrent behavior and determined a room temperature exciton binding energy of 210 meV with our device. In our phototransistor geometry, lateral p&#8208;n junctions serve as a simultaneous pathway for both photogenerated electrons and holes, reducing their recombination rate and thus enhancing photodetection. Our study establishes a new device platform for both fundamental studies and technological applications.

         <title>Microfluidic Screening&#8208;Assisted Machine Learning to Investigate Vertical Phase Separation of Small Molecule:Polymer Blend</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing is a widely utilized technique for the fabrication of various devices. In particular, the tunability of the ink composition and coating condition allow precise control of thin&#8208;film properties and device performance. Despite the advantage of having such tunability, the sheer number of possible combinations of slce parameters render it infeasible to efficiently optimize device performance and analyze the correlation between experimental parameters and device performance. In this work, microfluidic screening&#8208;embedded thin&#8208;film processing technique is developed, through which thin&#8208;films of varying ratios of small molecule semiconductor:polymer blend were simultaneously generated and screened in a time&#8208; and resource&#8208;efficient manner. Moreover, utilizing the thin&#8208;films of varying combinations of experimental parameters, machine learning models were trained to predict the transistor performance. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) algorithms tuned by Bayesian optimization showed the best predictive accuracy amongst the trained models, which enables narrowing down of the combinations of experimental parameters and investigation of the degree of vertical phase separation under the predicted parameter space. Our technique can serve as a guideline for elucidating the underlying complex parameter&#8208;property&#8208;performance correlations in solution&#8208;based thin&#8208;film processing, thereby accelerating the optimization of various thin&#8208;film devices in the future.

         <title>Scalable van der Waals Encapsulation by Inorganic Molecular Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Encapsulation is critical for devices to guarantee their stability and reliability. It becomes an even more essential requirement for devices based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with atomic thinness and far inferior stability compared to their bulk counterparts. Here we report a general van der Waals (vdW) encapsulation method for 2D materials using Sb2O3 layer of inorganic molecular crystal fabricated via thermal evaporation deposition. We demonstrate that such a scalable encapsulation method not only maintains the intrinsic properties of typical air&#8208;susceptible 2D materials due to their vdW interactions but also remarkably improves their environmental stability. Specifically, the encapsulated black phosphorus (BP) exhibits greatly enhanced structural stability of over 80 days and more sustaining electronic properties of 19 days while the bare BP undergoes degradation within hours. Moreover, our encapsulation layer can be facilely removed by sublimation in vacuum without damaging the underlying materials. This scalable encapsulation method shows a promising pathway to effectively enhance the environmental stability of 2D materials, which may further boost their practical application in novel (opto)electronic devices.

         <title>Elastic plasmonic&#8208;enhanced Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities with ultrasensitive stretching tunability</title>

Abstract
The emerging stretchable photonics field faces challenges like the robust integration of optical elements into elastic matrices or the generation of large opto&#8208;mechanical effects. Here we demonstrate the first stretchable plasmonic enhanced and wrinkled Fabry&#8208;Perot cavities, which are composed of self&#8208;embedded arrays of Au nanostructures at controlled depths into elastomer films. The novel self&#8208;embedding process is triggered by the Au nanostructures catalytic activity, which locally increases the polymer curing rate, thereby inducing a mechanical stress that simultaneously pulls the Au nanostructures into the polymer and forms a wrinkled skin layer. This geometry yields unprecedented opto&#8208;mechanical effects produced by the coupling of the broad plasmonic modes of the Au nanostructures and the Fabry&#8208;Perot modes, which are modulated by the wrinkled optical cavity. As a result, film stretching induces drastic changes in both the spectral position and intensity of the plasmonic enhanced Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances due to the simultaneous cavity thickness reduction and cavity wrinkle flattening, thus increasing the cavity finesse. We exploit these opto&#8208;mechanical effects to demonstrate new strain sensing approaches, achieving a strain detection limit of 0.006%, i.e., 16&#8208;fold lower than current optical strain detection schemes.

         <title>Revealing the Sulfur Redox Paths in a Li&#8211;S Battery by an In&#8208;Situ Hyphenated Technique of Electrochemistry and Mass Spectrometry</title>

Abstract
The lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) battery is one of the most promising next genertion energy storage systems due to its high theoretical specific energy. However, the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides formed during cell operation is a crucial reason for the low cyclability suffered by current Li&#8208;S batteries. As a result, an in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding of the sulfur cathode redox reactions is urgently required for further adancement of Li&#8208;S batteries. Herein, we report the direct observation of polysulfides in a Li&#8208;S battery by an in&#8208;situ hyphenated technique of electrochemistry and mass spectrometry. Several short&#8208;lived lithium polysulfide intermediates during sulfur redox have been identified. Furthermore, we apply this method to a mechanistic study of an electrocatalyst that has been observed to promote the polysulfides conversion in a Li&#8208;S cell. Through the abundance distributions of various polysulfides before and after adding the electrocatalyst, compelling experimental evidences of catalytic selectivity of cobalt phthalocyanine to those long&#8208;chain polysulfide intermediates are obtained. This work could provide guidance for the design of novel cathode to overcome the shuttle effect and facilitate the sulfur redox kinetics.

         <title>Recent Advances in Design of Electrocatalysts for High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrochemical water splitting technology for producing &#8220;green hydrogen&#8221; is important for the global mission of carbon neutrality. Electrocatalysts with decent performance at high current densities play a central role in the industrial implementation of this technology. This field has advanced immensely in recent years, as witnessed by many types of catalysts designed and synthesized toward industrially&#8208;relevant current densities (&gt; 200&#160;mA cm&#8211;2). By discussing recent advances in this field, we summarize several key aspects that affect the catalytic performance for high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysis, including dimensionality of catalysts, surface chemistry, electron transport path, morphology, and catalyst&#8208;electrolyte interplay. We highlight the multiscale design strategy that considers these aspects comprehensively for developing high&#8208;current&#8208;density electrocatalysts. We also put forward our perspectives on the future directions in this emerging field.

         <title>Simultaneous Interfacial Modification and Crystallization Control by Biguanide Hydrochloride for Stable Perovskite Solar Cell with PCE of 24.4%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial modification that serves multiple roles is vital for the fabrication of efficient and stable perovskite solar cells. Here, a multi&#8208;functional interfacial material, biguanide hydrochloride (BGCl), is introduced between SnO2 and perovskite to enhance electron extraction as well as crystal growth of perovskite. The BGCl can chemically link to the SnO2 through Lewis coordination/electrostatic coupling and help to anchor the PbI2. Better energetic alignment, reduced interfacial defects and homogeneous perovskite crystallites are achieved, yielding an impressive certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4%, with an open circuit voltage of 1.19&#160;V and a drastically improved fill factor of 82.4%. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 95% of its initial PCE after aging for over 500 h at 20 &#8451; and 30% relative humidity in ambient conditions. These results suggest that the incorporation of BGCl is a promising strategy to modify the interface and control the crystallization of the perovskite, towards the attainment of highly efficient and stable perovskite solar cells as well as other perovskite&#8208;based electronics.

         <title>Preparation of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc Heterophase Pd@Ir Nanostructures for High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures with fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase and different Pd/Ir atomic ratios are prepared via seeded phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth. The fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit superior catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution. This work offers new opportunities toward the rational synthesis of novel heterophase nanostructures and paves a way to the phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) for various promising applications.








Abstract
With the development of phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN), construction of noble&#8208;metal heterostructures with unconventional crystal phases, including heterophases, has been proposed as an attractive approach toward the rational design of highly efficient catalysts. However, it still remains challenging to realize the controlled preparation of such unconventional&#8208;phase noble&#8208;metal heterostructures and explore their crystal&#8208;phase&#8208;dependent applications. Here, various Pd@Ir core&#8211;shell nanostructures are synthesized with unconventional fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc heterophase (2H: hexagonal close&#8208;packed; fcc: face&#8208;centered cubic) through a wet&#8208;chemical seeded method. As a result, heterophase Pd66@Ir34 nanoparticles, Pd45@Ir55 multibranched nanodendrites, and Pd68@Ir22Co10 trimetallic nanoparticles are obtained via the phase&#8208;selective epitaxial growth of fcc&#8208;2H&#8208;fcc&#8208;heterophase Ir&#8208;based nanostructures on 2H&#8208;Pd seeds. Importantly, the heterophase Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites exhibit excellent catalytic performance toward electrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) under acidic conditions. An overpotential of only 11.0&#160;mV is required to achieve a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 on Pd45@Ir55 nanodendrites, which is lower than those of the conventional fcc&#8208;Pd47@Ir53 counterparts, commercial Ir/C and Pt/C. This work not only demonstrates an appealing route to synthesize novel heterophase nanomaterials for promising applications in the emerging field of PEN, but also highlights the significant role of the crystal phase in determining their catalytic properties.

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Switchable Laser via Optical Pumping of Rubrene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design and operation of a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind magnetically switchable laser is reported. The dependence of singlet&#8208;exciton fission on magnetic field is exploited to drive the gain medium below and above the lasing threshold using an external magnetic field. Magnetic switching results in a +360% modulation in output intensity, the largest magnetically induced change in brightness from a singlet&#8208;fission system to date.








Abstract
Volumetric optical imaging of magnetic fields is challenging with existing magneto&#8208;optical materials, motivating the search for dyes with strong magnetic field interactions, distinct emission spectra, and an ability to withstand high photon flux and incorporation within samples. Here, the magnetic field effect on singlet&#8208;exciton fission is exploited to demonstrate spatial imaging of magnetic fields in a thin film of rubrene. Doping rubrene with the high&#8208;quantum yield dye dibenzotetraphenylperiflanthene (DBP) is shown to enable optically pumped, slab waveguide lasing. This laser is magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;switchable: when operated just below the lasing threshold, application of a 0.4 T magnetic field switches the device between nonlasing and lasing modes, accompanied by an intensity modulation of +360%. This is thought to be the first demonstration of a magnetically switchable laser, as well as the largest magnetically induced change in emission brightness in a singlet&#8208;fission material to date. These results demonstrate that singlet&#8208;fission materials are promising materials for magnetic sensing applications and could inspire a new class of magneto&#8208;optical modulators.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Antiferromagnetism in Ni&#8208;Based Superconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging Ni&#8208;based infinite&#8208;layer superconducting oxide thin films mark the birth of the Ni age of superconductivity, which may differ from well&#8208;known high&#8208;temperature superconducting cuprates and Fe&#8208;based superconductors because no magnetic order is known in their bulk parent compounds. However, it has now been surprisingly discovered that long&#8208;range antiferromagnetism coexists with superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelate thin films.








Abstract
Due to the lack of any magnetic order down to 1.7 K in the parent bulk compound NdNiO2, the recently discovered 9&#8211;15 K superconductivity in the infinite&#8208;layer Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films has provided an exciting playground for unearthing new superconductivity mechanisms. Herein, the successful synthesis of a series of superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 thin films ranging from 8 to 40&#160;nm is reported. The large exchange bias effect is observed between the superconducting Nd0.8Sr0.2NiO2 films and a thin ferromagnetic layer, which suggests the existence of the antiferromagnetic order. Furthermore, the existence of the antiferromagnetic order is evidenced by X&#8208;ray magnetic linear dichroism measurements. These experimental results are fundamentally critical for the current field.

         <title>Highly Efficient Photothermal Conversion and Water Transport during Solar Evaporation Enabled by Amorphous Hollow Multishelled Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is prepared for the first time. This HoMS results in highly efficient energy conversion and rapid water transport, achieving superfast evaporation speed with long&#8208;term stability. A World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, water containing metallic ions, and extremely acidic/alkaline , radioactive, and virus&#8208;polluted water.








Abstract
Solar evaporation, which enables water purification without consuming fossil fuels, has been considered the most promising strategy to address global scarcity of drinkable water. However, the suboptimal structure and composition designs still result in a trade&#8208;off between photothermal conversion, water transport, and tolerance to harsh environments. Here, an ultrastable amorphous Ta2O5/C nanocomposite is designed with a hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) for solar evaporation. This HoMS results in highly efficient photoabsorption and photothermal conversion, as well as a decrease of the actual water evaporation enthalpy. A superfast evaporation speed of 4.02&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 is achieved. More importantly, a World Health Organization standard drinkable water can be achieved from seawater, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208; and bacteria&#8208;containing water, and even from extremely acidic/alkaline or radioactive water sources. Notably, the concentration of pseudovirus SC2&#8208;P can be decreased by 6 orders of magnitude after evaporation.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Surface Structural Effects on High&#8208;Temperature Operational Resiliency of Layered Oxide Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature calendar aging and thermal runaway have led to severe performance decay and safety concerns regarding battery cathodes. By using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational resilience of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported.








Abstract
The worldwide energy demand in electric vehicles and the increasing global temperature have called for development of high&#8208;energy and long&#8208;life lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with improved high&#8208;temperature operational resiliency. However, current attention has been mostly focused on cycling aging at elevated temperature, leaving considerable gaps of knowledge in the failure mechanism, and practical control of abusive calendar aging and thermal runaway that are highly related to the eventual operational lifetime and safety performance of LIBs. Herein, using a combination of various in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray and electron microscopy techniques, a multiscale understanding of surface structure effects involved in regulating the high&#8208;temperature operational tolerance of polycrystalline Ni&#8208;rich layered cathodes is reported. The results collectively show that an ultraconformal poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) coating can effectively prevent a LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 cathode from undergoing undesired phase transformation and transition metal dissolution on the surface, atomic displacement, and dislocations within primary particles, intergranular cracking along the grain boundaries within secondary particles, and intensive bulk oxygen release during high state&#8208;of&#8208;charge and high&#8208;temperature aging. The present work highlights the essential role of surface structure controls in overcoming the multiscale degradation pathways of high&#8208;energy battery materials at extreme temperature.

         <title>A &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained Metal twins&#8221; Strategy to Prepare Efficient dual&#8208;metal atom Catalysts for Cooperative Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>

Abstract
Dual&#8208;metal atom center catalysts (DACs) are a novel frontier in oxygen electrocatalysis, boasting functional and electronic synergies between contiguous metal centers and higher catalytic activities than single atom center catalysts. However, the definition and catalytic mechanism of DACs configurations remain unclear. Here, a &#8220;pre&#8208;constrained metal twins&#8221; strategy was proposed to prepare contiguous FeN4 and CoN4 DACs with homogeneous conformations embedded in an N&#8208;doped graphitic carbon (FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC). A programmable phthalocyanines dimer was used as a structural moiety to anchor the bimetallic sites (containing Co and Fe) in a metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) to achieve delocalized dispersion before pyrolysis. The resultant FeCo&#8208;DACs/NC exhibited excellent electrochemical performance in oxygen electrocatalysis and rechargeable Zn&#8208;air batteries. Theoretical calculations demonstrated that the synergetic interaction of adjacent metals optimized the d&#8208;band center position of metal centers and balanced the free energy of the *O intermediate, thereby improving the oxygen electrocatalytic activity. This work opens up an avenue for the rational design of DACs with tailored electronic structures and uniform geometric configurations.

         <title>Growth of Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials at the Wafer Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth has become a critical bottleneck for scaling up applications of van der Waal (vdW) layered two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials in high&#8208;end electronics and optoelectronics. Most vdW 2D materials were initially obtained through top&#8208;down synthesis methods, such as exfoliation, which can only prepare small flakes on a micrometer scale. Bottom&#8208;up growth can enable 2D flake growth over a large area. However, seamless merging of these flakes to form large&#8208;area continuous films with well&#8208;controlled layer thickness and lattice orientation is still a significant challenge. In this review, we briefly introduce several vdW layered 2D materials covering their lattice structures, representative physical properties, and potential roles in large&#8208;scale applications. Then, several methods used to grow vdW layered 2D materials at the wafer&#8208;scale are reviewed in depth. In particular, we summarize three strategies that enable 2D film growth with a single&#8208;crystalline structure over the whole wafer: growth of an isolated domain, growth of unidirectional domains, and conversion of oriented precursors. After that, we review the progress in using wafer&#8208;scale 2D materials in integrated devices and advanced epitaxy. Finally, future directions in the growth and scaling of vdW layered 2D materials are discussed.

         <title>Anionic Redox Regulated via Metal&#8211;Ligand Combinations in Layered Sulfides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cathodes utilizing anionic redox chemistry have higher energy density, but are still accompanied by reversibility problems. In this work, by regulating metal&#8211;ligand combinations, it is found that strong covalency between cations and anions can stabilize holes, and grants the cathode with better electron conductivity, prevents irreversible anion dimerization and cation migration, and thus restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay issues.








Abstract
The increasing demand for energy storage is calling for improvements in cathode performance. In traditional layered cathodes, the higher energy of the metal 3d over the O 2p orbital results in one&#8208;band cationic redox; capacity solely from cations cannot meet the needs for higher energy density. Emerging anionic redox chemistry is promising to access higher capacity. In recent studies, the low&#8208;lying O nonbonding 2p orbital was&#160;designed to activate one&#8208;band oxygen redox, but they are still accompanied by reversibility problems like oxygen loss, irreversible cation migration, and voltage decay. Herein, by regulating the metal&#8211;ligand energy level, both extra capacities provided by anionic redox and highly reversible anionic redox process are realized in NaCr1&#8722;yVyS2 system. The simultaneous cationic and anionic redox of Cr/V and S is observed by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure (XANES). Under high d&#8211;p hybridization, the strong covalent interaction stabilizes the holes on the anions, prevents irreversible dimerization and cation migration, and restrains voltage hysteresis and voltage decay. The work provides a fundamental understanding of highly reversible anionic redox in layered compounds, and demonstrates the feasibility of anionic redox chemistry based on hybridized bands with d&#8211;p covalence.

         <title>Self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 with bacteria&#8208;derived outer&#8208;membrane vesicle for enhanced cancer immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
The checkpoint inhibitor therapy that blocks the Programmed Death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) and its major ligand PD&#8208;L1; has achieved encouraging clinical efficacy in certain cancers. However; the binding of checkpoint inhibitors with other immune cells that express PD&#8208;L1 often results in a low response rate to the blockade and severe adverse effects. Herein; we developed a LyP1 polypeptide&#8208;modified outer&#8208;membrane vesicle (LOMV) loaded with a PD&#8208;1 plasmid to achieve self&#8208;blockade of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. The nanocarriers accumulated in the tumor tissue through OMV&#8208;targeting ability and were internalized into the tumor cells via LyP1&#8208;mediated target; subsequently delivering PD&#8208;1 plasmid into the nucleus; leading to the expression of PD&#8208;1 by tumor cells. In addition; a magnetic particle chemiluminescence kit was developed to quantitatively detect the binding rate of PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1. The self&#8208;expressed PD&#8208;1 bonded with the PD&#8208;L1 expressed by both autologous and neighboring tumor cells; achieving self&#8208;blockade. Simultaneously; the outer&#8208;membrane protein of LOMV recruited cytotoxic lymphocyte cells and natural killer cells to tumor tissues and stimulated them to secrete IFN&#8208;&#947;; improving the antitumor activity of the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 self&#8208;blocking therapy.

         <title>Anisotropic Carrier Mobility from 2H WSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with 2H phase are expected to be the building blocks in next&#8208;generation electronics, however, suffered from electrical anisotropy, which is the basics for multi&#8208;terminal artificial synaptic devices, digital inverters, and anisotropic memtransistors that are highly desired in neuromorphic computing. Herein, the anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 is reported for the first time, where the anisotropic degree of carrier mobility spans from 0.16 to 0.95 for various WSe2 field effect transistors under a gate voltage of &#8722;60&#160;V. Phonon scattering, impurity ions scattering, and defect scattering are excluded for anisotropic mobility. Intrinsic screening layer is proposed and confirmed by Z&#8208;contrast STEM imaging to respond to the electrical anisotropy. Seven types of intrinsic screening layers are created and calculated by density functional theory to evaluate modulated electronic structures, effective masses, and scattering intensities, resulting in anisotropic mobility. The discovery of anisotropic carrier mobility from 2H WSe2 provides a degree of freedom for adjusting the physical properties of 2H TMDCs and a fertile ground for exploring and integrating the TMDCs electronic transistors with better performance along the direction of high mobility.

         <title>Constructing a Stable Interface Layer by Tailoring Solvation Chemistry in Carbonate Electrolytes for High Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) are considered as promising next&#8208;generation batteries due to their high energy density. However, commercial carbonate electrolytes cannot be used in LMBs due to their poor compatibility with lithium metal anode and detrimental HF generation by LiPF6 decomposition. By introducing LiNO3 additive and a small amount of tetramethylurea as a multifunctional cosolvent to a commercial carbonate electrolyte, NO3&#8211; which is usually insoluble can be introduced into the solvation structure of Li+ to form a conductive and stable SEI. At the same time, HF generation is suppressed by manipulating the solvation structure and a scavenging effect. As a result, the Coulombic efficiency (CE) of Li||Cu half cells using the designed carbonate electrolyte can reach 98.19% at room temperature and 96.14% at a low temperature (&#8208;15 &#8451;), and Li||LFP cells deliver a high capacity retention of 94.9% with a high CE of 99.6% after 550 cycles. This work provides a simple and effective way to extend the use of commercial carbonate electrolytes for next&#8208;generation battery systems.

         <title>High&#8208;Performing Self&#8208;Powered Photosensing and Reconfigurable Pyro&#8208;photoelectric Memory with Ferroelectric Hafnium Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept hafnium oxide (HfO2)&#8208;based self&#8208;powered, ultrafast (60 &#181;s), and high&#8208;performing (68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1) infrared pyroelectric sensor is developed. Further, a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory with controllable suspension and reestablishment of self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse is demonstrated. Using the innovative approach, advanced applications like memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency warning systems are offered.








Abstract
With highly diverse multifunctional properties, hafnium oxide (HfO2) has attracted considerable attention not only because of its potential to address fundamental questions about material behaviors, but also its potential for applied perspectives like ferroelectric memory, transistors, and pyroelectric sensors.&#160;However, effective harvesting of the pyro&#8208;photoelectric effect of HfO2 to develop high&#8208;performing self&#8208;biased photosensors and electric writable and optical readable memory has yet to be developed. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept HfO2&#8208;based self&#8208;powered and ultrafast (response time &#8776; 60 &#181;s) infrared pyroelectric sensor with a responsivity of up to 68 &#181;A&#8201;W&#8722;1 is developed. In particular, temporal infrared light illumination induced surface heating and, in turn, change in spontaneous polarization are attributed to robust pyro&#8208;photocurrent generation. Further, controllable suspension and reestablishment of the self&#8208;biased pyro&#8208;photocurrent response with a short electric pulse are demonstrated, which offers a conceptually new kind of photoreadable memory. Potentially, the novel approach opens a new avenue for designing on&#8208;demand pyro&#8208;phototronic response over a desired area and offers the opportunity to utilize it for various applications, including memory storage, neuromorphic vision sensors, classification, and emergency alert systems.

         <title>Multicolor Photonic Pigments for Rotation&#8208;Asymmetric Mechanochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel multicolor photonic pigment is developed by magnetically assembling Fe3O4 nanorods and fixing the resulting tetragonal photonic crystals. Its dynamic color tuning and precise orientational control enable the convenient printing of structural&#8208;colored patterns and the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic devices.








Abstract
Photonic crystals are extensively explored to replace inorganic pigments and organic dyes as coloring elements in printing, painting, sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting due to their brilliant structural colors, chemical stability, and environmental friendliness. However, most existing photonic&#8208;crystal&#8208;based pigments can only display monochromatic colors once made, and generating multicolors has to start with designing different building blocks. Here, a novel photonic pigment featuring highly tunable structural colors in the entire visible spectrum, made by the magnetic assembly of monodisperse nanorods into body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal photonic crystals, is reported. Their prominent magnetic and crystal anisotropy makes it efficient to generate multicolors using one photonic pigment by magnetically controlling the crystal orientation. Further, the combination of angle&#8208;dependent diffraction and magnetic orientation control enables the design of rotation&#8208;asymmetric photonic films that display distinct patterns and encrypted information in response to rotation. The efficient multicolor generation through precise orientational control makes this novel photonic pigment promising in developing high&#8208;performance structural&#8208;colored materials and optical devices.

         <title>Liquid Gating Meniscus&#8208;Shaped Deformable Magnetoelastic Membranes with Self&#8208;Driven Regulation of Gas/Liquid Release</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid gating magnetoelastic membrane with meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations actuated by magnetic stimuli is reported to actively regulate gas/liquid release. It introduces a universal and new self&#8208;driven strategy for smart liquid gating membranes, combining fast and contactless operation and nonfouling behavior for energy&#8208;saving multiphase fluid transport and separation, and visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring.








Abstract
Liquid gating membranes have been demonstrated to show unprecedented properties of dynamicity, stability, adaptivity, and stimulus&#8208;responsiveness. Most recently, smart liquid gating membranes have attracted increasing attention to bring some brand&#8208;new properties for real&#8208;world applications, and various environment&#8208;driven systems have been created. Here, a self&#8208;driven system of a smart liquid gating membrane is further developed by designing a new sytem based on a liquid gating magnetoelastic porous membrane with reversible meniscus&#8208;shaped deformations, and it is not subject to the complex gating liquid restriction of magnetorheological fluids. Compared with other systems, this magnetic&#8208;responsive self&#8208;driven system has the advantage that it provides a universal and convenient way to realize active regulation of gas/liquid release. Experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrate the stability, the nonfouling behavior, and the tunability of the system. In addition, this system can be used to perfectly open and close gas transport, and the gating pressure threshold for the liquid release can be reduced under the same conditions. Based on the above capabilities, combined with the fast and 3D contactless operation, it will be of benefit in fields ranging from visible gas/liquid mixture content monitoring and energy&#8208;saving multiphase separation, remote fluid release, and beyond.

         <title>Suppressing the Step Effect of 3D Printing for Constructing Contact Lenses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is exploited to eliminate the step effect. Reutilization and good control of the liquid residual can improve the printing fidelity and avoid a post&#8208;washing process. Based on this strategy, a centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with nanoscale roughness and high&#8208;definition imaging can be 3D printed, indicating its great potential in scalable 3D printing optical structures.








Abstract
3D printing has been considered as a sustainable method to construct complicated 3D structures. However, the step effect induced by the traditional point&#8208;by&#8208;point or layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer additive manufacturing mode inevitably occurs and remains an obstacle to realizing the smoothness and uniformity of 3D samples. Here, a continuous liquid film confined 3D printing strategy is proposed to fabricate high&#8208;precision 3D structures based on the Digital Light Processing (DLP) technology. With the control of the confinement of the liquid&#8211;solid interface and the continuous printing mode, liquid film adhering to the cured structure is sucked into the cured layer structures with excess resin adhering to the cured structure scraping off, where the step effect is eliminated and post&#8208;washing is avoided. The morphology and dimension of the confined liquid film can be well regulated by ink properties and printing parameters to optimize the surface smoothness and printing fidelity. In addition, heat accumulation and thermal diffusion are also suppressed, ensuring the long&#8208;term printing stability. A centimeter&#8208;scale contact lens structure with central thickness of &#8776;135&#160;&#181;m comparable to commercial ones can be printed, which possesses extreme smoothness (sub 1.3&#160;nm), homogeneous mechanical characteristic, biocompatibility, and high optical properties with imaging resolution of up to 228.1 lp mm&#8722;1.

         <title>Defective Bimetallic Selenides for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bimetallic CuInSe2 with Se vacanies (V&#8208;CuInSe2) significantly optimizes the adsorption of CO2 electroreduction intermediates owing to its moderate band center relative to the Fermi level. Meanwhile, hydrogen evolution is suppressed on V&#8208;CuInSe2 due to an energetically unfavorable surface reconstruction after hydrogen adsorption. Consequently, the V&#8208;CuInSe2 achieves a highly active and selective CO generation ability.








Abstract
CO2 electroreduction (CO2RR) to CO is promising for the carbon cycle but still remains challenging. Au is regarded as the most selective catalyst for CO2RR, but its high cost significantly hinders its industrial application. Herein, the bimetallic CuInSe2 is found to exhibit an Au&#8208;like catalytic feature: i) the interaction of Cu and In orbitals induces a moderate adsorption strength of CO2RR intermediates and favors the reaction pathway; and ii) the hydrogen evolution is energetically unfavorable on CuInSe2, as a surface reconstruction along with high energy change will occur after hydrogen adsorption. Furthermore, the Se vacancy is found to induce an electron redistribution, slightly tune the band structure, and optimize the CO2RR route of bimetallic selenide. Consequently, the Se&#8208;defective CuInSe2 (V&#8208;CuInSe2) achieves a highly selective CO production ability that is comparable to noble metals in aqueous electrolyte, and the V&#8208;CuInSe2 cathode shows a satisfactory performance in an aqueous Zn&#8211;CO2 cell. This work demonstrates that designing cost&#8208;effective catalysts with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;like properties is an ideal strategy for developing efficient electrocatalysts. Moreover, the class of transition bimetallic selenides has shown promising prospects as active and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts owing to their unique structural, electronic, and catalytic properties.

         <title>Antiangiogenic Nanomicelles for the Topical Delivery of Aflibercept to Treat Retinal Neovascular Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
nEPCs + A are aflibercept&#8208;loaded nanomicelles formed by encapsulating aflibercept in an EPC copolymer solution. In this study, the ability of nEPCs + A to deliver clinically significant amounts of aflibercept to the retina for control of choroidal neovascularization in mice is described. Interestingly, nEPCs also demonstrate intrinsic antiangiogenic activity, which synergizes with their drug delivery capability for the treatment of neovascular retinal diseases.








Abstract
The traditional intravitreal injection delivery of antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti&#8208;VEGF) to the posterior segment of the eye for treatment of retinal diseases is invasive and associated with sight&#8208;threatening complications. To avoid such complications, there has been significant interest in developing polymers for topical drug delivery to the retina. This study reports a nanomicelle drug delivery system made of a copolymer EPC (nEPCs), which is capable of delivering aflibercept to the posterior segment topically through corneal&#8211;scleral routes. EPC is composed of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(propylene glycol) (PPG), and polycaprolactone (PCL) segments. In this study, aflibercept&#8208;loaded nEPCs (nEPCs + A) are capable of penetrating the cornea in ex vivo porcine eye models and deliver a clinically significant amount of aflibercept to the retina in laser&#8208;induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) murine models, causing CNV regression. nEPCs + A also demonstrate biocompatibility in vitro and in vivo. Interestingly, this study also suggests that nEPCs have intrinsic antiangiogenic properties. The ability to deliver anti&#8208;VEGF drugs and the intrinsic antiangiogenic properties of nEPCs may result in synergistic effects, which can be harnessed for effective therapeutics. nEPCs may be a promising topical anti&#8208;VEGF delivery platform for the treatment of retinal diseases.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Ion Oligomerization Inside Electrified Carbon Micropores and its Effect on Capacitive Charge Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oligomerization of transition metal aqua ions inside electrified carbon micropores is observed using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate together via hydroxo bridging under the synergy of confinement and negative charging. The resulting ionic oligomers have sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, leading to capacitance fading of supercapacitors. Positive charging destructs them and revivifies the capaictance.








Abstract
Ion adsorption inside electrified carbon micropores is pivotal for the operation of supercapacitors. Depending on the electrolyte, two main mechanisms have been identified so far, the desolvation of ions in solvents and the formation of superionic states in ionic liquids. Here, it is shown that upon confinement inside negatively charged micropores, transition&#8208;metal cations dissolved in water associate to form oligomer species. They are identified using in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. The cations associate one with each other via hydroxo bridging, forming ionic oligomers under the synergic effect of spatial confinement and Coulombic screening. The oligomers display sluggish dissociation kinetics and accumulate upon cycling, which leads to supercapacitor capacitance fading. They may be dissolved by applying a positive potential, so an intermittent reverse cycling strategy is proposed to periodically evacuate micropores and revivify the capacitance. These results reveal new insights into ion adsorption and structural evolution with their effects on the electrochemical performance, providing guidelines for designing advanced supercapacitors.

         <title>Tailoring Layer Number of 2D Porphyrin&#8208;Based MOF Towards Photo&#8208;Coupled Electroreduction of CO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Inspired by the success of graphene, a series of single&#8208; or few&#8208;layer two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials have been developed and applied in the past decade. Here, we report the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer (two dimensional) 2D porphyrin&#8208;based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO2 electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 pathway due to the restructuring of Cu&#8208;O4 sites while CO and HCOO&#8211; are the major products over the bilayer. In photo&#8208;coupled electrocatalysis, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C2 compounds shows a nearly 4&#8208;fold increase on the monolayer than that under dark condition (FEC2 increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at &#8208;1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light&#8208;induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of 2D material.

Here, we report the successful preparation of monolayer and bilayer (two dimensional) 2D porphyrin-based metal organic frameworks (MOFs) by a facile solvothermal method. The structure transition from monolayer to bilayer drives distinct electronic properties and restructuring behaviors, which finally results in distinct catalytic pathways towards CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrocatalysis. The monolayer favors CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-to-C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; pathway due to the restructuring of Cu-O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; sites while CO and HCOO&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;&lt;/sup&gt; are the major products over the bilayer. In photo-coupled electrocatalysis, Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; compounds shows a nearly 4-fold increase on the monolayer than that under dark condition (FE&lt;sub&gt;C2&lt;/sub&gt; increases from 11.9% to 41.1% at -1.4&#160;V). For comparison, the light field plays a negligible effect on the bilayer. The light-induced selectivity optimization is investigated by experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This work opens up a novel possibility to tune the selectivity of carbon products just by tailoring the layer number of 2D material.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Giant Thermal Transport Tuning at a Metal/Ferroelectric Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Giant thermal transport tuning is observed at a metal/ferroelectric interface by switching the ferroelectric polarization orientations. This work shows that surface bound charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in the next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.








Abstract
Interfacial thermal transport plays a prominent role in the thermal management of nanoscale objects and is of fundamental importance for basic research and nanodevices. At metal/insulator interfaces, a configuration commonly found in electronic devices, heat transport strongly depends upon the effective energy transfer from thermalized electrons in the metal to the phonons in the insulator. However, the mechanism of interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling and thermal transport at metal/insulator interfaces is not well understood. Here, the observation of a substantial enhancement of the interfacial thermal resistance and the important role of surface charges at the metal/ferroelectric interface in an Al/BiFeO3 membrane are reported. By applying uniaxial strain, the interfacial thermal resistance can be varied substantially (up to an order of magnitude), which is attributed to the renormalized interfacial electron&#8211;phonon coupling caused by the charge redistribution at the interface due to the polarization rotation. These results imply that surface charges at a metal/insulator interface can substantially enhance the interfacial electron&#8211;phonon&#8208;mediated thermal coupling, providing a new route to optimize the thermal transport performance in next&#8208;generation nanodevices, power electronics, and thermal logic devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Phenolic Network&#8208;Coated Dendrimer&#8208;Drug Conjugates for Tumor MR Imaging and Chemo/Chemodynamic Therapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress</title>

Abstract
Amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS) to realize enhanced cancer therapy has been considered to be unique in current cancer nanomedicine design. Herein, we report the design of metal&#8208;phenolic network&#8208;coated dendrimer&#8208;drug conjugates as a novel theranostic nanoplatform based on ERS amplification. In our design, acetylated generation 5 poly(amidoamine) dendrimers were conjugated with an ERS drug toyocamycin (Toy) through the attached phenylboronic acid moiety, and coated with iron (Fe)&#8208;tannic acid (TF) network. The generated nanocomplexes with a size of 50.2&#160;nm are stable under a physiological environment, and can rapidly release Toy under the tumor microenvironment due to the pH&#8208; and reactive oxygen species&#8208;responsive boronic ester bonds to effectively inhibit the ERS&#8208;mediated cancer cell adaptation. Meanwhile, the coated TF network enables the nanocomplexes to generate cytotoxic hydroxyl radicals through a Fenton reaction, amplifying the ERS for improved chemotherapy/chemodynamic therapy of cancer cells in vitro and a xenografted breast tumor model in vivo. Moreover, the coating of TF also renders the complexes with an eminent r1 relaxivity for in vivo T1&#8208;weighted tumor magnetic resonance imaging. The created intelligent nanocomplexes may represent an advanced nanomedicine formulation uniquely integrated with metal&#8208;phenolic network and dendrimer nanotechnology for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy through ERS amplification.

         <title>Critical review on low&#8208;temperature Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
With the highest energy density ever among all sorts of commercialized rechargeable batteries, Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) have stimulated the upsurge utilization in 3C devices, electric vehicles, and stationary energy storage systems. However, a high performance of commercial LIBs based on ethylene carbonate electrolytes and graphite anodes can only be achieved at above &#8208;20&#176;C, which restricts their applications in harsh environments. In this review, we provided a comprehensive research progress and in&#8208;depth understanding of the critical factors leading to the poor low&#8208;temperature performance of LIBs, sorted out the distinctive challenges on the anodes, electrolytes, cathodes and electrolyte&#8208;electrodes interphases, with a special focus on Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism therein. Finally, promising strategies and solutions for improving low&#8208;temperature performance were highlighted to maximize the working&#8208;temperature range of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion/metal batteries.

The role of iodide as an additive in lithium&#8211;oxygen batteries is not well understood, especially in the charging process. The recent advances on LiI are reviewed and the synergistic effect with water is discussed. Alternative approaches for enabling the charging process are also provided.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;oxygen (Li&#8211;O2) batteries possess a high theoretical energy density, which means they could become a potential alternative to lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Nevertheless, the charging process of Li&#8211;O2 batteries requires much higher energy, due to the insulating nature of the discharge product. It has been revealed that the anion additive, lithium iodide (LiI), can tune the cell chemistry to form lithium hydroxide (LiOH) as the product and facilitate the kinetics during the charging process. Although numerous studies have been reported, the role of this additive is still under investigation. Herein, the recent advances focusing on the use of LiI in Li&#8211;O2 batteries are reviewed, its catalytic behavior on discharge and charge is discussed, and its synergistic effect with water is understood. The ambiguity existing among the studies are also revealed, and solutions to the current issues are introduced.

Abstract
Cancer nanomedicine combined with immunotherapy has become a promising strategy for treating cancer in terms of safety and potency; however, precise regulation of the activation of antitumor immunity remains challenging. We herein report a smart semiconducting polymer nano&#8208;immunomodulator (SPNI) in response to acidic tumor microenvironment (TME) for precision photodynamic immunotherapy of cancer. SPNI is self&#8208;assembled by a NIR&#8208;absorbing semiconducting polymer, and an amphipathic polymer conjugated with a Toll like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist via an acid&#8208;liable linker. Upon arrival at tumor site, SPNI undergoes hydrolysis and triggers an efficient liberation of TLR7 agonist in response to acidic TME for DC activation. Moreover, SPNI exerts photodynamic effects for direct tumor eradication and immunogenic cancer cell death under NIR photoirradiation. The synergistic action of released immunogenic factors and acidic TME&#8208;activated TLR7 agonist can serve as an in situ generated cancer vaccine to evoke strong antitumor activities. Notably, such localized immune activation boosts systemic antitumor immune responses, resulting in enhanced cytotoxic CD8+ T infiltration to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis. Thereby, this work presents a general strategy to devise prodrug of immunotherapeutics for precise regulation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Tough, Transparent, 3D printable and Self&#8208;healing Polyethylene Glycol&#8208;Gel (PEGgel)</title>

Abstract
Polymer gels, such as hydrogels, consisting of cross&#8208;linked polymer chains and small molecule solvents, have been widely used in biomedical applications, flexible electronics and soft machines due to the similarity of their mechanical properties to those of soft biological tissues. Polymer network design and its contribution to the properties of such materials has been extensively studied. In this study, we demonstrate the critical influence of the solvent nature on the mechanical properties and performance of soft polymer gels. Here, we report a polymer gel system (PEGgel) based on a poly(hydroxyethyl methacrylate&#8208;co&#8208;acrylic acid) copolymerized in the presence of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) used as the liquid phase of the PEGgel. Compared to the corresponding hydrogel or ethylene glycol based gel, the PEGgel demonstrates exceptional physical properties, such as high stretchability and toughness, rapid self&#8208;healing, and long&#8208;term stability under ambient conditions. Depending on the molecular weight and fraction of PEG, the tensile strength of PEGgels varied from 0.22&#160;MPa to 41.3&#160;MPa, fracture strain from 12% to 4336%, modulus from 0.08&#160;MPa to 352&#160;MPa, and toughness from 2.89&#160;MJ m&#8211;3 to 56.23&#160;MJ m&#8211;3. The influence of PEG on the mechanical properties was evaluated using the coarse&#8208;grain molecular dynamics (CGMD) model and solid&#8208;state NMR, revealing abundant weak hydrogen bonding leading to the observed enhancement of mechanical properties. Finally, we demonstrated rapid self&#8208;healing of PEGgel materials and fabricated a self&#8208;healing pneumatic actuator by 3D printing of PEGgel structures. The enhanced mechanical properties of the PEGgel system could be extended to other polymer networks (both chemically and physically cross&#8208;linked). This study demonstrates the important influence of the liquid phase of polymer gels on their mechanical and other properties, and highlights the potential for finetuning different physical properties of gels through the use of PEG possessing weak but multiple hydrogen bond interactions with the polymer network. Such a simple 3D printable, self&#8208;healing and tough soft material holds promise for broad applications in wearable electronics, soft actuators and robotics.

         <title>Reconstructable Uterus&#8208;Derived Materials for Uterus Recovery towards Efficient Live Births</title>

Abstract
Uterine factor infertility is increasingly common in modern society and has severely affected human life and health. However, the existing biomaterial scaffold&#8208;mediated system remains limited in efficiently uterus recovery, leading to low pregnancy rate and live birth. Here, we demonstrate a reconstructable uterus&#8208;derived materials (RUMs) by combing with uterus&#8208;derived extracellular matrix (ECM) and seeded chorionic villi mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) for uterus recovery, achieving highly efficient live births in rats with severe uterine injury. The RUMs can be designed into different states (such as liquid RUMs and solid RUMs) and shapes (such as cuboid, triangular&#8208;prism and cube) in terms of requirements. The RUMs can effectively prevent intrauterine adhesion, and promote endometrial regeneration and muscle collagen reconstruction as well as accelerate wound healing by constructing physical barrier and secreting cytokines, allowing efficient uterus recovery. The injured uterus nearly achieves complete regeneration after treating with our RUMs and has normal pregnancies for supporting fetal development and live births, similar to the normal rats. Our study provides a regenerative medicine therapeutics for uterine factor infertility.

         <title>High Current&#8208;density Organic Electrochemical Diodes Enabled by Asymmetric Active Layer Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to outstanding electrical/electrochemical performance, operational stability, mechanical flexibility, and decent biocompatibility, organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors have shown great potential as implantable electrodes for neural recording/stimulation and as active channels for signal switching/amplifying transistors. Nonetheless, no studies exist on the general design rule for high&#8208;performance electrochemical diodes, which are essential for highly functional circuit architectures. Herein, we report on generalizable electrochemical diodes with very high current density over 30 kAcm&#8722;2 by introducing an asymmetric active layer based on organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors. The underlying mechanism on polarity&#8208;sensitive balanced ionic doping/dedoping is elucidated by numerical device analysis and in operando spectroelectrochemical potential mapping, while the general material requirements for electrochemical diode operation are deduced using various types of conjugated polymers. In parallel, analog signal rectification and digital logic processing circuits are successfully demonstrated to show the broad impact of organic electrochemical diode&#8208;incorporated circuits. We expect that organic electrochemical diodes will play vital roles in realizing multifunctional soft bioelectronic circuitry in combination with organic electrochemical transistors.

         <title>Mixed Dimethylammonium/Methylammonium Lead Halide Perovskite Single Crystals for Improved Structural Stability and Enhanced Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We utilize the solvent acidolysis crystallization technique to grow mixed dimethylammonium/methylammonium lead tribromide (DMA/MAPbBr3) crystals reaching the highest dimethylammonium incorporation of 44% while maintaining the 3D cubic perovskite phase. These mixed perovskite crystals show suppression of the orthorhombic phase and a lower tetragonal to cubic phase transition temperature compared to MAPbBr3. We observe distinct behavior in the temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties of MAPbBr3 and mixed DMA/MAPbBr3 crystals due to the different organic cation dynamics governing the phase transition(s). Furthermore, we fabricate lateral photodetectors which show that, at room temperature, the mixed crystals possess higher detectivity compared to MAPbBr3 crystals caused by structural compression and reduced surface trap density. Remarkably, the mixed crystal devices exhibit large enhancement in their detectivity below the phase transition temperature (at 200K), while the MAPbBr3 devices demonstrate insignificant changes. The higher detectivity makes our devices attractive for visible light communication and for space applications. Our results highlight the importance of the synthetic technique for the halide perovskites compositional engineering that governs their structural and optoelectronic properties.

         <title>Redistributed Current Density in Lateral Organic Light&#8208;emitting Transistors Enabling Uniform Area Emission with Good Stability and Arbitrary Tunability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs), integrating the functions of an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) and an organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) in a single device, have unique advantages to meet the miniaturization and integration trend for the next&#8208;generation display technology. However, the great challenge of achieving uniform area emission in OLETs, especially in lateral OLETs that with good planar integration significantly hinders their development in this field. Herein, we propose an effective solution to obtain well&#8208;defined area emission in lateral OLETs in which a charge transport buffer (CTB) layer is introduced between the conducting channel and emitting layer beneath the drain electrode. Comprehensive theoretical simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the potential beneath the drain electrode is well&#8208;redistributed, which is mainly attributed to the shielding effect of the CBT&#8208;layer on the equipotential drain electrode. As a result, a highly uniform current density under the drain electrode was observed. In this case, uniform recombination of balanced holes and electrons can be guaranteed, which is essential for the formation of area emission in the following OLETs. Furthermore, well&#8208;defined uniform RGB area emission OLETs were constructed by incorporating 2,7&#8208;dioctyl[1] benzothieno[3,2&#8208;b][1]benzo&#8208;thiophene (C8&#8208;BTBT) as the conducting layer, 1,1&#8208;bis[(di&#8208;4&#8208;tolamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) as CTB&#8208;layer and three phosphorescent materials as the emitting layer. These RGB area&#8208;emission OLETs demonstrate good gate tunable ability (ON/OFF ratio 106), high loop stability (over 200 cycles) as well as high aperture ratio (over 80%) due to the arbitrary tunability of device geometry. This work provides a new avenue for constructing area&#8208;emission lateral OLETs, which have great potential for display technology because of their good compatibility with conventional fabrication techniques.

         <title>Anisotropic Nodal&#8208;Line&#8208;Derived Large Anomalous Hall Conductivity in ZrMnP and HfMnP</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anomalous Hall conductivity appears in metallic ferromagnets due to the anomalous velocity of charge carriers in the presence of a magnetic field. In ferromagnets ZrMnP and HfMnP, the abundance of mirror planes forming nodal lines at the Fermi energy guides and enhances such velocity, resulting in both the compounds exhibiting large value of anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The nontrivial band structure of semimetals has attracted substantial research attention in condensed matter physics and materials science in recent years owing to its intriguing physical properties. Within this class, a group of nontrivial materials known as nodal&#8208;line semimetals is particularly important. Nodal&#8208;line semimetals exhibit the potential effects of electronic correlation in nonmagnetic materials, whereas they enhance the contribution of the Berry curvature in magnetic materials, resulting in high anomalous Hall conductivity (AHC). In this study, two ferromagnetic compounds, namely ZrMnP and HfMnP, are selected, wherein the abundance of mirror planes in the crystal structure ensures gapped nodal lines at the Fermi energy. These nodal lines result in one of the largest AHC values of 2840 &#937;&#8722;1 cm&#8722;1, with a high anomalous Hall angle of 13.6% in these compounds. First&#8208;principles calculations provide a clear and detailed understanding of nodal line&#8208;enhanced AHC. The finding suggests a guideline for searching large AHC compounds.

         <title>Atomic Structure Evolution of Pt&#8211;Co Binary Catalysts: Single Metal Sites versus Intermetallic Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Key factors determining whether the alloying or atomization of Pt NPs on a single Co site rich carbon support are dynamically revealed, including initial Pt loadings, particle sizes, the nature of the carbon supports, and the annealing conditions. The corresponding ordered Pt3Co intermetallic and single Pt/Co site (i.e., PtC3N/CoN4) catalysts are evaluated for the oxygen reduction reaction. The established structure&#8211;property correlations shed light on the design of advanced Pt&#8208;based electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Due to their exceptional catalytic properties for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and other crucial electrochemical reactions, PtCo intermetallic nanoparticle (NP) and single atomic (SA) Pt metal site catalysts have received considerable attention. However, their formation mechanisms at the atomic level during high&#8208;temperature annealing processes remain elusive. Here, the thermally driven structure evolution of Pt&#8211;Co binary catalyst systems is investigated using advanced in situ electron microscopy, including PtCo intermetallic alloys and single Pt/Co metal sites. The pre&#8208;doping of CoN4 sites in carbon supports and the initial Pt NP sizes play essential roles in forming either Pt3Co intermetallics or single Pt/Co metal sites. Importantly, the initial Pt NP loadings against the carbon support are critical to whether alloying to L12&#8208;ordered Pt3Co NPs or atomizing to SA Pt sites at high temperatures. High Pt NP loadings (e.g., 20%) tend to lead to the formation of highly ordered Pt3Co intermetallic NPs with excellent activity and enhanced stability toward the ORR. In contrast, at a relatively low Pt loading (&lt;6&#160;wt%), the formation of single Pt sites in the form of PtC3N is thermodynamically favorable, in which a synergy between the PtC3N and the CoN4 sites could enhance the catalytic activity for the ORR, but showing insufficient stability.

         <title>Design Principles of Sodium/Potassium Protection Layer for High&#8208;Power High&#8208;Energy Sodium/Potassium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes: a Case Study of Na2Te/K2Te</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Na2Te (K2Te) protection layer with high ionic conductivity, low electronic conductivity, and high mechanical stability on a Na (K) metal anode is designed and prepared. The Na@Na2Te (K@K2Te) realizes excellent electrochemi cal performance for sodium&#8208;metal (potassiummetal) batteries of both symmetrical cells and full batteries in widely used carbonate electrolytes.








Abstract
The sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes combine low&#8208;cost, high theoretical capacity, and high energy density, demonstrating promising application in sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal batteries. However, the dendrites&#8217; growth on the surface of Na (K) has impeded their practical application. Herein, density functional theory (DFT) results predict Na2Te/K2Te is beneficial for Na+/K+ transport and can effectively suppress the formation of the dendrites because of low Na+/K+ migration energy barrier and ultrahigh Na+/K+ diffusion coefficient of 3.7 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1/1.6 &#215; 10&#8722;10 cm2 s&#8722;1 (300 K), respectively. Then a Na2Te protection layer is prepared by directly painting the nanosized Te powder onto the sodium&#8208;metal surface. The Na@Na2Te anode can last for 700 h in low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes (1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 1 mAh cm&#8722;2), and the corresponding Na3V2 (PO4)3//Na@Na2Te full cell exhibits high energy density of 223&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an unprecedented power density of 29687 W kg&#8722;1 as well as an ultrahigh capacity retention of 93% after 3000 cycles at 20 C. Besides, the K@K2Te&#8208;based potassium&#8208;metal full battery also demonstrates high power density of 20 577 W kg&#8722;1 with energy density of 154&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. This work opens up a new and promising avenue to stabilize sodium (potassium)&#8208;metal anodes with simple and low&#8208;cost interfacial layers.

         <title>Direct Atomic&#8208;Scale Structure and Electric Field Imaging of Triazine&#8208;Based Crystalline Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy technique reveals the local atomic configuration and also directly determines the atomic electric field of poly(triazine imide) crystal, the triazine&#8208;based crystalline carbon nitride. These findings offer a fundamental insight on the electronic structure for photoabsorption and the migration of charge carriers in photocatalysis with this material.








Abstract
Crystalline carbon nitrides (CNs) have recently attracted considerable attention owing to their superior photocatalytic activity. However, the electron&#8208;beam&#8208;sensitive nature of crystalline CNs hinders atomic&#8208;resolution imaging of their local structures by conventional (scanning) transmission electron microscopy ((S)TEM) techniques. Here, the atomic structure of a triazine&#8208;based crystalline CN, poly(triazine imide) (PTI) incorporated with lithium and chloride ions, is unambiguously revealed using the emerging imaging technique of differential phase contrast STEM under a low dose. The lightest&#8208;element Li/H configuration is resolved within framework cavities of PTI and significantly affects the electronic structure for photoabsorption. The atomic electric field of PTI crystal directly determined in real space provides a fundamental evidence for the chemical bonding of Li ions and adjacent atoms for the migration of photogenerated carriers. These results facilitate the comprehension on local atomic configuration and chemical bonding state of crystalline CNs and can lead to a deeper understanding of the photocatalytic mechanism.

         <title>Managing Growth and Dimensionality of Quasi 2D Perovskite Single&#8208;Crystalline Flakes for Tunable Excitons Orientation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;sized quasi 2D&#8208;perovskites with tunable number of inorganic layers are synthesized by an innovative synthetic approach based on the use of a reactant, potassium iodide, that can modulate the supersaturation levels of the perovskite precursors solution without being part of the final products. Exciton orientation is changed from &#8220;in&#8208;plane&#8221; to &#8220;out&#8208;of&#8208;plane&#8221; by increasing the &#8220;n&#8221; value.








Abstract
Hybrid perovskites are among the most promising materials for optoelectronic applications. Their 2D crystalline form is even more interesting since the alternating inorganic and organic layers naturally forge a multiple quantum&#8208;well structure, leading to the formation of stable excitonic resonances. Nevertheless, a controlled modulation of the quantum well width, which is defined by the number of inorganic layers (n) between two organic ones, is not trivial and represents the main synthetic challenge in the field. Here, a conceptually innovative approach to easily tune n in lead iodide perovskite single&#8208;crystalline flakes is presented. The judicious use of potassium iodide is found to modulate the supersaturation levels of the precursors solution without being part of the final products. This allows to obtain a fine tuning of the n value. The excellent optical quality of the as synthesized flakes guarantees an in&#8208;depth analysis by Fourier&#8208;space microscopy, revealing that the excitons orientation can be manipulated by modifying the number of inorganic layers. Excitonic out&#8208;of&#8208;plane component, indeed, is enhanced when &#8220;n&#8221; is increased. The combined advances in the synthesis and optical characterization fill in the picture of the exciton behavior in low&#8208;dimensional perovskite, paving the way to the design of materials with improved optoelectronic characteristics.

         <title>Promoting Oral Mucosal Wound Healing with a Hydrogel Adhesive Based on a Phototriggered S&#8208;Nitrosylation Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a new coupling reaction, an easily operated hydrogel adhesive that features thin&#8208;layer fabrication, ultrafast gelation, appropriate elasticity, and excellent tissue adhesion is developed. This hydrogel adhesive matches the material requirements for oral mucosal treatment and establishes a conducive microenvironment for tissue growth, thus notably shortening the healing time of mucosal wounds.








Abstract
The wet and highly dynamic environment of the mouth makes local treatment of oral mucosal diseases challenging. To overcome this, a photo&#8208;crosslinking hydrogel adhesive is developed inspired by the success of light&#8208;curing techniques in dentistry. The adhesive operates on a fast (within 5 s) phototriggered S&#8208;nitrosylation coupling reaction and employs imine anchoring to connect to host tissues. Unlike other often&#8208;used clinical agents that adhere weakly and for short durations, this thin, elastic, adhesive, and degradable cyclic o&#8208;nitrobenzyl&#8208;modified hyaluronic acid gel protects mucosal wounds from disturbance by liquid rinsing, oral movement, and friction for more than 24 h. The results from both rat and pig oral mucosa repair models demonstrate that this new gel adhesive creates a favorable microenvironment for tissue repair and can shorten tissue healing time. This study thus illustrates a therapeutic strategy with the potential to advance the treatment of oral mucosal defects in the clinic.

         <title>Crystal Phase Transition Creates a Highly Active and Stable RuCX Nanosurface for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Alkaline Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystal phase&#8208;transition of Ru/C from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packing to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packing creates a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) nanosurface on Ru nanocrystal. The as&#8208;created RuCX nanosurface presents a highly active and stable performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in alkaline media. Density functional theory calculations predict the RuCX sites as bifunctional configurations for improving alkaline HER kinetics.








Abstract
Although metastable crystal structures have received much attention owing to their utilization in various fields, their phase&#8208;transition to a thermodynamic structure has attracted comparably little interest. In the case of nanoscale crystals, such an exothermic phase&#8208;transition releases high energy within a confined surface area and reconstructs surface atomic arrangement in a short time. Thus, this high&#8208;energy nanosurface may create novel crystal structures when some elements are supplied. In this work, the creation of a ruthenium carbide (RuCX, X&#160;&lt;&#160;1) phase on the surface of the Ru nanocrystal is discovered during phase&#8208;transition from cubic&#8208;close&#8208;packed to hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed structure. When the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is tested in alkaline media, the RuCX exhibits a much lower overpotential and good stability relative to the counterpart Ru&#8208;based catalysts and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pt/C catalyst. Density functional theory calculations predict that the local heterogeneity of the outermost RuCX surface promotes the bifunctional HER mechanism by providing catalytic sites for both H adsorption and facile water dissociation.

         <title>Direct Measurement of Oxygen Mass Transport at the Nanoscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method based on atom probe tomography for the direct measurement of ion kinetics at the nanoscale is reported. Extremely high 3D resolution (&lt;1&#160;nm) and straight correlation with local cation distribution are demonstrated for the exemplary case of a mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductor exhibiting enhanced grain boundary oxygen diffusivity.








Abstract
Tuning oxygen mass transport properties at the nanoscale offers a promising approach for developing high performing energy materials. A number of strategies for engineering interfaces with enhanced oxygen diffusivity and surface exchange have been proposed. However, the origin and the magnitude of such local effects remain largely undisclosed to date due to the lack of direct measurement tools with sufficient resolution. In this work, atom probe tomography with sub&#8208;nanometer resolution is used to study oxygen mass transport on oxygen&#8208;isotope exchanged thin films of lanthanum chromite. A direct 3D visualization of nanoscaled highly conducting oxygen incorporation pathways along grain boundaries, with reliable quantification of the oxygen kinetic parameters and correlative link to local chemistries, is presented. Combined with finite element simulations of the exact nanostructure, isotope exchange&#8208;atom probe tomography allowed quantifying an enhancement in the grain boundary oxygen diffusivity and in the surface exchange coefficient of lanthanum chromite of about 4 and 3 orders of magnitude, respectively, compared to the bulk. This remarkable increase of the oxygen kinetics in an interface&#8208;dominated material is unambiguously attributed to grain boundary conduction highways thanks to the use of a powerful technique that can be straightforwardly extended to the study of currently inaccessible multiple nanoscale mass transport phenomena.

         <title>Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light&#8208;switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.








Abstract
Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light&#8208;responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well&#8208;defined biochemical and physical properties.

     alt="Engineering Photoresponsive Ligand Tethers for Mechanical Regulation of Stem Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy is developed to regulate the behaviors and functions of stem cells by switching the states of light-switchable tethers. This method offers the chance to study mechanotransduction via cellular tethers and realize spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating stem cell functions by precisely controlling the nanoscale presentation of bioactive ligands has a substantial impact on tissue engineering and regenerative medicine but remains a major challenge. Here it is shown that bioactive ligands can become mechanically &#8220;invisible&#8221; by increasing their tether lengths to the substrate beyond a critical length, providing a way to regulate mechanotransduction without changing the biochemical conditions. Building on this finding, light switchable tethers are rationally designed, whose lengths can be modulated reversibly by switching a light-responsive protein, pdDronpa, in between monomer and dimer states. This allows the regulation of the adhesion, spreading, and differentiation of stem cells by light on substrates of well-defined biochemical and physical properties. Spatiotemporal regulation of differential cell fates on the same substrate is further demonstrated, which may represent an important step toward constructing complex organoids or mini tissues by spatially defining the mechanical cues of the cellular microenvironment with light.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volatilizable Solid Additive&#8208;Assisted Treatment Enables Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 18.8% and Fill Factor Exceeding 80%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new morphology control approach is developed to fabricate high&#8208;performance organic solar cells by utilizing the synergistic effect of 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN) and dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) additives. This approach exhibits general application in various active layer systems to achieve well&#8208;developed morphology, enabling outstanding power&#8208;conversion efficiency over 18.8% and fill factor exceeding 80% for the device based on PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM.








Abstract
Controlling the self&#8208;assembling of organic semiconductors to form well&#8208;developed nanoscale phase separation in the bulk&#8208;heterojunction active layer is critical yet challenging for building high&#8208;performance organic solar cells (OSCs). Particularly, the similar anisotropic conjugated structures between nonfullerene acceptors and p&#8208;type organic semiconductor donors raise more complexity on manipulating their aggregation toward appropriate phase separation. Herein, a new approach to tune the morphology of photoactive layer is developed by utilizing the synergistic effect of dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene (DTT) and 1&#8208;chloronaphthalene (CN). The volatilizable solid additive DTT with high crystallinity can restrict the over self&#8208;assembling of nonfullerene acceptors during the film casting process, and then allowing the refining of phase separation and molecular packing with the simultaneous volatilization of DTT under thermal annealing. Consequently, the PTQ10:m&#8208;BTP&#8208;PhC6:PC71BM&#8208;based ternary OSCs processed by the dual additives of CN and DTT record a notable power&#8208;conversion efficiency of 18.89%, with a remarkable FF of 80.6%.

Abstract
Organic single crystals with excellent optical and electrical properties are critical for the development of organic optoelectronics. Herein, two compounds 9,10&#8208;bis([N,N&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;4&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TPA&#8208;An) and 9,10&#8208;bis([1&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;diphenyl]&#8208;5&#8242;&#8208;phenylethynyl)anthracene (TBA&#8208;An) are synthesized by introducing two different luminescent groups, triphenylamine and 1,3&#8208;diphenylbenzene, at the 9,10 positions of anthracene via triple bond connection. Single crystals based on TPA&#8208;An and TBA&#8208;An with a ribbon morphology obtained through the slow solvent&#8208;evaporation method exhibit high photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 98% and 99% at room temperature, and remarkable hole mobilities of 0.45 and 0.15 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in single&#8208;crystal organic field&#8208;effect transistors (SC&#8208;OFETs). Furthermore, UV phototransistors based on the two single crystals obtain photosensitivities of 1.03 &#215; 103 and 3.45 &#215; 104, ultrahigh photoresponsivities of 7.19 &#215; 105 and 1.50&#160;&#215; 105 A W&#8722;1, and the detectivities exceeding 1.40 &#215; 1016 and 1.60 &#215; 1017 Jones.

         <title>Photoinduced Halide Segregation in Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D Mixed Halide Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D mixed halide perovskites with bandgap tunability and increased stability are employed in photovoltaics, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and optoelectronics. Inherent halide ion mobility (instability) of mixed halides drives photoinduced halide ion segregation. The important role of dimensionality across 3D to 2D perovskites governs the excited&#8208;state dynamics and the kinetics of halide segregation and dark recovery.








Abstract
2D lead halide perovskites, which exhibit bandgap tunability and increased chemical stability, have been found to be useful for designing optoelectronic devices. Reducing dimensionality with decreasing number of layers (n&#160;=&#160;10&#8211;1) also imparts resistance to light&#8208;induced ion migration as seen from the halide ion segregation and dark recovery in mixed halide (Br:I&#160;=&#160;50:50) perovskite films. The light&#8208;induced halide ion segregation efficiency, as determined from difference absorbance spectra, decreases from 20% to &lt;1%&#160;as the dimensionality is decreased for 2D perovskite film from n&#160;=&#160;10 to 1. The segregation rate constant (ksegregation), which decreases from 5.9&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;10) to 3.6&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;s&#8722;1 (n&#160;=&#160;1), correlates well with nearly an order of magnitude decrease observed in charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (&#964;average&#160;=&#160;233&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;10&#160;vs &#964;avg&#160;=&#160;27&#160;ps for n&#160;=&#160;1). The tightly bound excitons in 2D perovskites make charge separation less probable, which in turn decreases the halide mobility and resulting phase segregation. The importance of controlling the dimensionality of the 2D architecture in suppressing halide ion mobility is discussed.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Capacitive Pressure Sensors over a Wide Pressure Range Enabled by the Hybrid Responses of a Highly Porous Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low sensitivity at large pressure is a long&#8208;standing obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. A novel soft capacitive pressure sensor that employs an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite is a promising solution for resolving this chronic challenge. This hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor exhibits unprecedented sensitivity up to 50 kPa. An analytical model explains its mechanism and enables selection of optimal manufacturing parameters.








Abstract
Past research aimed at increasing the sensitivity of capacitive pressure sensors has mostly focused on developing dielectric layers with surface/porous structures or higher dielectric constants. However, such strategies have only been effective in improving sensitivities at low pressure ranges (e.g., up to 3&#160;kPa). To overcome this well&#8208;known obstacle, herein, a flexible hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS) composed of an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) laminated with an ultrathin dielectric layer is devised. Using a nickel foam template, the PNC is fabricated with carbon nanotubes (CNTs)&#8208;doped Ecoflex to be 86% porous and electrically conductive. The PNC exhibits hybrid piezoresistive and piezocapacitive responses, resulting in significantly enhanced sensitivities (i.e., more than 400%) over wide pressure ranges, from 3.13 kPa&#8722;1 within 0&#8211;1 kPa to 0.43 kPa&#8722;1 within 30&#8211;50 kPa. The effect of the hybrid responses is differentiated from the effect of porosity or high dielectric constants by comparing the HRPS with its purely piezocapacitive counterparts. Fundamental understanding of the HRPS and the prediction of optimal CNT doping are achieved through simplified analytical models. The HRPS is able to measure pressures from as subtle as the temporal arterial pulse to as large as footsteps.

A metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching strategy to bring about the controllable synthesis of a series of covalent organic framework based multicomponent nanocomposites from core&#8211;shell, yolk&#8211;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere structures is presented. Combining the unique yolk&#8211;shell structure with the synergistic effects of the three components, the MTCN&#8208;H (ys) demon strates remarkable catalytic performance in photocatalytic reduction of CO2 with H2O.








Abstract
The precise tuning and multi&#8208;dimensional processing of covalent organic frameworks (COFs)&#8208;based materials into multicomponent superstructures with appropriate diversity are essential to maximize their advantages in catalytic reactions. However, up to now, it remains an ongoing challenge for the precise design of COFs&#8208;based multicomponent nanocomposites with diverse architectures. Herein, a metal organic framework (MOF)&#8208;sacrificed in situ acid&#8208;etching (MSISAE) strategy that enables continuous synthesis of core&#8208;shell, yolk&#8208;shell, and hollow&#8208;sphere COFs&#8208;based nanocomposites through tuning of core decomposition (NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 into TiO2) rate is developed. More importantly, due to the multiple active sites, fast transfer of carriers, increased light utilization ability, et al, one of the obtained samples, NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125/TiO2@COF&#8208;366&#8208;Ni&#8208;OH&#8208;HAc (yolk&#8208;shell) with special three components, exhibits high photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency in the gas&#8208;solid mode. The MSISAE strategy developed in this work achieves the precise morphology design and control of multicomponent hybrid composites based on COFs, which may pave a new way in devealoping porous crystalline materials with powerful superstructures for multifunctional catalytic reactions.

         <title>A Conductive Network and Dipole Field for Harnessing Photogenerated Charge Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2 network exhibits two orders of magnitude enhancement in electric conductivity, which will greatly suppress electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) recombination by reducing the charge&#8208;transfer resistance. In addition, 2D MXene induces a dipole at the interface. The dipole field pushes charge extraction and suppresses charge recombination by inducing band bending.








Abstract
Photogenerated charge separation and directional transfer to active sites are pivotal steps in photocatalysis, which limit the efficiency of redox reactions. Here, a conductive network and dipole field are employed to harness photogenerated charge kinetics by using a Ti3C2/TiO2 network (TTN). The TTN exhibits a prolonged charge&#8208;carrier lifetime (1.026&#160;ns) and an 11.76&#8208;fold increase in hexavalent chromium photoreduction reaction kinetics compared to TiO2 nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs). This super photocatalytic performance is derived from the efficient photogenerated charge kinetics, which is steered by the conductive network and dipole field. The conductivity enhancement of the TiO2 network is achieved by continuous chemical bonds, which promotes electron&#8211;hole (e&#8211;h) separation. In addition, at the interface of Ti3C2 and TiO2, band bending induced by the dipole field promotes photogenerated electron spatially directed transfer to the catalytic sites on Ti3C2. This study demonstrates that a conductive network and dipole field offer a new concept to harness charge kinetics for photocatalysis.

         <title>Coupling Glucose&#8208;Assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) Redox with Electrochemical Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new approach is proposed to achieve low&#8208;voltage and continuous hydrogen production using glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox as the anode reaction. Glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) spontaneously, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Water electrolysis is a sustainable technology for hydrogen production since this process can utilize the intermittent electricity generated by renewable energy such as solar, wind, and hydro. However, the large&#8208;scale application of this process is restricted by the high electricity consumption due to the large potential gap (&gt;1.23&#160;V) between the anodic oxygen evolution reaction and the cathodic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a novel and efficient hydrogen production system is developed for coupling glucose&#8208;assisted Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox with HER. The onset potential of the electrooxidation of Cu(I) to Cu(II) is as low as 0.7 VRHE (vs reversible hydrogen electrode). In situ Raman spectroscopy, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and density functional theory calculation demonstrates that glucose in the electrolyte can reduce the Cu(II) into Cu(I) instantaneously via a thermocatalysis process, thus completing the cycle of Cu(I)/Cu(II) redox. The assembled electrolyzer only requires a voltage input of 0.92&#160;V to achieve a current density of 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Consequently, the electricity consumption for per cubic H2 produced in the system is 2.2&#160;kWh, only half of the value for conventional water electrolysis (4.5&#160;kWh). This work provides a promising strategy for the low&#8208;cost, efficient production of high&#8208;purity H2.

         <title>Physiologically Self&#8208;Regulated, Fully Implantable, Battery&#8208;Free System for Peripheral Nerve Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A physiologically self&#8208;regulated, fully implantable, battery&#8208;free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.








Abstract
The long&#8208;segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self&#8208;regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve&#8208;preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self&#8208;regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI&#8208;NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self&#8208;responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI&#8208;NES system is significantly close to the autograft.

&lt;p&gt;A physiologically self-regulated, fully implantable, battery-free neural electrical stimulation system is successfully constructed to produce physiologically electrical signals for the acceleration of regeneration and functional recovery of peripheral nerve injury.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The long-segment peripheral nerve injury (PNI) represents a global medical challenge, leading to incomplete nerve tissue recovery and unsatisfactory functional reconstruction. However, the current electrical stimulation (ES) apparatuses fail perfect nerve repair due to their inability of the variable synchronous self-regulated function with physiological states. It is urgent to develop an implantable ES platform with physiologically adaptive function to provide instantaneous and nerve-preferred ES. Here, a physiologically self-regulated electrical signal is generated by integrating a novel tribo/piezoelectric hybrid nanogenerator with a nanoporous nerve guide conduit to construct a fully implantable neural electrical stimulation (FI-NES) system. The optimal neural ES parameters completely originate from the body itself and are highly self-responsive to different physiological states. The morphological evaluation, representative protein expression level, and functional reconstruction of the regenerated nerves are conducted to assess the PNI recovery process. Evidence shows that the recovery effect of 15&#160;mm length nerve defects under the guidance of the FI-NES system is significantly close to the autograft. The designed FI-NES system provides an effective method for long-term accelerating the recovery of PNI in vivo and is also appropriate for other tissue injury or neurodegenerative diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Construction of Six&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Coordinated Single Ni Sites on g&#8208;C3N4 with Boron&#8208;Oxo Species for Photocatalytic Water&#8208;Activation&#8208;Induced CO2 Reduction</title>

         <dc:description>
Six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites are successfully anchored by highly dispersed boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets. The as&#8208;fabricated single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst can realize efficient photocatalytic CO2 reduction, where single Ni atoms can effectively capture photoelectrons and preferentially reduce absorbed water to produce H atoms as active species eventually inducing the reduction of CO2.








Abstract
The configuration regulation of single&#8208;atom photocatalysts (SAPCs) can significantly influence the interfacial charge transfer and subsequent catalytic process. The construction of conventional SAPCs for aqueous CO2 reduction is mainly devoted toward favorable activation and photoreduction of CO2, however, the role of water is frequently neglected. In this work, single Ni atoms are successfully anchored by boron&#8208;oxo species on g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets through a facile ion&#8208;exchange method. The dative interaction between the B atom and the sp2 N atom of g&#8208;C3N4 guarantees the high dispersion of boron&#8208;oxo species, where O atoms coordinate with single Ni (II) sites to obtain a unique six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated configuration. The optimized single&#8208;atom Ni photocatalyst, rivaling Pt&#8208;modified g&#8208;C3N4 nanosheets, provides excellent CO2 reduction rate with CO and CH4 as products. Quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra, transient absorption spectra, isotopic labeling, and in situ Fourier transform infrared spectra reveal that as&#8208;fabricated six&#8208;oxygen&#8208;coordinated single Ni (II) sites can effectively capture the photoelectrons of CN along the B&#63743;O bridges and preferentially activate adsorbed water to produce H atoms to eventually induce a hydrogen&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. This work diversifies the synthetic strategies for single&#8208;atom catalysts and provides insight on correlation between the single&#8208;atom configuration and reaction pathway.

         <title>High&#8208;Speed Fabrication of All&#8208;Inkjet&#8208;Printed Organometallic Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes on Elastic Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inkjet&#8208;printing approaches are used to fabricate flexible organometallic halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes on elastic substrates from the bottom anode to the top cathode under ambient conditions. The fabrication time is significantly shortened by at least tenfold. The device has a novel simplified 4&#8208;layer structure without conventional electron&#8208; and hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer, but still exhibits extremely high performance even under aggressive bending tests.








Abstract
Halide perovskites have great potential for use in high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and displays. Here, a perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) fabricated directly on an elastomer substrate, in which every single layer in the device from bottom anode to top cathode is patterned solely using a highly scalable inkjet printing process, is reported. Compared to PeLEDs made using conventional microfabrication processes, the printing process significantly shortens the fabrication time by at least tenfold (from over 5 h to less than 25 min). The all&#8208;printed PeLEDs have a novel 4&#8208;layer structure (bottom electrode, perovskite emissive layer, buffer layer, top electrode) without separate electron or hole transporting layers. For flexible PeLEDs printed directly in ambient conditions, a turn&#8208;on voltage, maximum luminance intensity, and maximum current efficiency of 3.46&#160;V, 10227&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and 2.01&#160;cd&#160;A&#8722;1, respectively, is achieved. The devices also exhibit excellent robustness and stability even when bent to a curvature radius of 2.5&#160;mm. The reported device structure and fabrication processes can enable high&#8208;performance flexible PeLEDs to be manufactured over a larger area at extremely low cost and fast speed, which can facilitate the adoption of the promising PeLED technology in the emerging foldable displays, smart wearables, and many other applications.

Abstract
Cancer vaccine platform has attracted great interest in the field of cancer immunotherapy. Here, 3D printed scaffolds loaded with immunoregulators are developed for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The rapid manufacturing and precise molding based on 3D printing can realize the mass manufacturing of cancer vaccines and personalized design. Meanwhile, compared to the traditional hydrogel, the 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows its similar functions compared with real lymphoid organs by recruitment of a great number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures,&#8221; where there is a promising site to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade to inhibit the tumor growth. Personalized antitumor scaffold vaccines are further demonstrated for filling of tumor site after surgery to prevent cancer metastasis. Taken together, these results promise the 3D printing scaffold vaccine as the potential strategy for cancer vaccine therapy in the future.

         <title>Superior High&#8208;Temperature Strength in a Supersaturated Refractory High&#8208;Entropy Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural materials with exceptional high&#8208;temperature strengths are highly desirable for high&#8208;temperature applications. In this work, three alloy&#8208;design principles of the large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature&#8208;dependence of elastic properties, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw dislocations are used to design a CrMoNbV refractory high&#8208;entropy alloy, which exhibits outperforming high&#8208;temperature strengths.








Abstract
Refractory high&#8208;entropy alloys (RHEAs) show promising applications at high temperatures. However, achieving high strengths at elevated temperatures above 1173K is still challenging due to heat softening. Using intrinsic material characteristics as the alloy&#8208;design principles, a single&#8208;phase body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) CrMoNbV RHEA with high&#8208;temperature strengths (beyond 1000&#160;MPa at 1273 K) is designed, superior to other reported RHEAs as well as conventional superalloys. The origin of the high&#8208;temperature strength is revealed by in situ neutron scattering, transmission&#8208;electron microscopy, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The CrMoNbV's elevated&#8208;temperature strength retention up to 1273 K arises from its large atomic&#8208;size and elastic&#8208;modulus mismatches, the insensitive temperature dependence of elastic constants, and the dominance of non&#8208;screw character dislocations caused by the strong solute pinning, which makes the solid&#8208;solution strengthening pronounced. The alloy&#8208;design principles and the insights in this study pave the way to design RHEAs with outstanding high&#8208;temperature strength.

         <title>In&#8208;Materio Reservoir Computing in a Sulfonated Polyaniline Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) that exhibits ionic conduction in a humid environment is used as an in materio reservoir for reservoir computing (RC). The output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves RC performance. Practical spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy, demonstrating that SPAN OEND can manage time&#8208;series data operation in RC.








Abstract
A sulfonated polyaniline (SPAN) organic electrochemical network device (OEND) is fabricated using a simple drop&#8208;casting method on multiple Au electrodes for use in reservoir computing (RC). The SPAN network has humidity&#8208;dependent electrical properties. Under high humidity, the SPAN OEND exhibits mainly ionic conduction, including charging of an electric double layer and ionic diffusion. The nonlinearity and hysteresis of the current&#8211;voltage characteristics progressively increase with increasing humidity. The rich dynamic output behavior indicates wide variations for each electrode, which improves the RC performance because of the disordered network. For RC, waveform generation and short&#8208;term memory tasks are realized by a linear combination of outputs. The waveform task accuracy and memory capacity calculated from a short&#8208;term memory task reach 90% and 33.9, respectively. Improved spoken&#8208;digit classification is realized with 60% accuracy by only 12 outputs, demonstrating that the SPAN OEND can manage time series dynamic data operation in RC owing to a combination of rich dynamic and nonlinear electronic properties. The results suggest that SPAN&#8208;based electrochemical systems can be applied for material&#8208;based computing, by exploiting their intrinsic physicochemical behavior.

         <title>Controllable Doping in 2D Layered Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable doping by modulating the thickness is realized in 2D layered materials. The decreasing thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies in thicker PtSSe to anion vacancies in thinner PtSSe, which leads to controllable doping. Thickness&#8208;modulated doping shows great potential in novel electronics and optoelectronics, especially including diodes and photodetectors.








Abstract
For each generation of semiconductors, the issue of doping techniques is always placed at the top of the priority list since it determines whether a material can be used in the electronic and optoelectronic industry or not. When it comes to 2D materials, significant challenges have been found in controllably doping 2D semiconductors into p&#8208; or n&#8208;type, let alone developing a continuous control of this process. Here, a unique self&#8208;modulated doping characteristic in 2D layered materials such as PtSSe, PtS0.8Se1.2, PdSe2, and WSe2 is reported. The varying number of vertically stacked&#8208;monolayers is the critical factor for controllably tuning the same material from p&#8208;type to intrinsic, and to n&#8208;type doping. Importantly, it is found that the thickness&#8208;induced lattice deformation makes defects in PtSSe transit from Pt vacancies to anion vacancies based on dynamic and thermodynamic analyses, which leads to p&#8208; and n&#8208;type conductance, respectively. By thickness&#8208;modulated doping, WSe2 diode exhibits a high rectification ratio of 4400 and a large open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.38&#160;V. Meanwhile, the PtSSe detector overcomes the shortcoming of large dark&#8208;current in narrow&#8208;bandgap optoelectronic devices. All these findings provide a brand&#8208;new perspective for fundamental scientific studies and applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Conductive Protonated Layered Oxides from H2O Vapor&#8208;Annealed Brownmillerites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. In this work, a thermal hydration synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. By incorporating H2O into the lattice frame, the insulating brownmillerite SrCoO2.5 transforms to a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H, which demonstrates a highly improved electric conduction.








Abstract
Protonated 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides often display low electronic conduction, which hampers their application in electric, magnetic, thermoelectric, and catalytic fields. Electronic conduction can be enhanced by co&#8208;inserting oxygen acceptors simultaneously. However, the currently used redox approaches hinder protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;insertion due to the selective switching issues. Here, a thermal hydration strategy for systematically exploring the synthesis of conductive protonated oxides from 3d transition&#8208;metal oxides is introduced. This strategy is illustrated by synthesizing a novel layered&#8208;oxide SrCoO3H from the brownmillerite SrCoO2.5. Compared to the insulating SrCoO2.5, SrCoO3H exhibits an unprecedented high electronic conductivity above room temperature, water uptake at 250&#160;&#176;C, and a thermoelectric power factor of up to 1.2&#160;mW K&#8722;2 m&#8722;1 at 300 K. These findings open up opportunities for creating high&#8208;conductive protonated layered oxides by protons and oxygen ions co&#8208;doping.

         <title>Polymerized Hybrid Perovskites with Enhanced Stability, Flexibility, and Lattice Rigidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid perovskite with unsaturated  organoammoniums is demonstrated to be able to undergo solid&#8208;state polymerization without damaging the perovskite structure. The polymerized perovskite behaves like a polymer with enhanced stability and flexi bility. The lattice rigidity is also enhanced due to the polymerized covalent C&#63743;C bonding. As a result, a stable and efficient polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diode with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% is demonstrated.








Abstract
The intrinsic soft lattice nature of organometal halide perovskites (OHPs) makes them very tolerant to defects and ideal candidates for solution&#8208;processed optoelectronic devices. However, the soft lattice results in low stability towards external stresses such as heating and humidity, high density of phonons and strong electron&#8211;phonon coupling (EPC). Here, it is demonstrated that the OHPs with unsaturated 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium (VBA) as organoammonium cations can be polymerized without damaging the perovskite structure and its tolerance to defects. The polymerized perovskites show enhanced stability and flexibility compared to regular three&#8208;dimensional and two&#8208;dimensional (2D) perovskites. Furthermore, the polymerized 4&#8208;vinylbenzylammonium group improves perovskite lattice rigidity substantially, resulting in a reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination rate because of suppressed electron&#8211;phonon coupling, and enhanced carrier mobility because of suppressed phonon scattering. 2D polymerized perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) with strong electroluminescence at room temperature, and quasi&#8208;2D PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.2% and enhanced operation stability are demonstrated. The work has opened a new way of enhancing the intrinsic stability and optoelectronic properties of OHPs.

         <title>Understanding the Synergistic Oxidation in Dichalcogenides through Electrochemiluminescence Blinking at Millisecond Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic oxidation in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is revealed through electrochemiluminescence blinking. The formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the oxygen migration to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping, which favors the formation of Mo&#8211;O&#8211;Mo, as active sites. This mechanism is universal to transition metal dichalcogenides containing sulfur atoms.








Abstract
The oxidation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) has been extensively studied and applied in electronics, optics, and energy sources because of its tunable structure and performance. However, due to the lack of appropriate technology, dynamically observe the oxidation process remains an arduous task. Herein, the synergistic oxidation between edge and basal plane in molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is observed through electrogenerated chemiluminescence (ECL) blinking with a millisecond resolution. In addition, the ECL method provides a simple, convenient, and quick way to judge structural changes. The transient elevation of the ECL intensity proved the intermittent doping of oxygen at MoS2, which generates O&#8208;atom active sites. High ECL intensity enhanced from the produced hydroperoxide intermediates eases the monitoring of MoS2 particles. Further study shows that the formation of sulfur vacancies at MoS2, by the edge activation of hydrogen peroxide and the migration of oxygen to the basal plane, is more conducive to oxygen doping that favors the formation of Mo&#63743;O&#63743;Mo as new active sites to induce bursts. The revealing of sulfur vacancy&#8208;governed blinking from MoS2 indicates a complex interaction between oxygen and MoS2. The same phenomenon is observed on tungsten disulfide (WS2), which provides new information about the oxidation feature of 2D dichalcogenides.

         <title>Reborn Three&#8208;Dimensional Graphene with Ultrahigh Volumetric Desalination Capacity</title>

3D graphene (3DG) is repeatedly crushed and reshaped to upgrade its overall performance like &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana.&#8221; 3DG is reborn to a higher self as NvG, making it emerge with unprecedented advantages in areas such as capacitive deionization and becoming a new engine to initiate the development of innovative 3D structures for carbon materials.








Abstract
The constructing of 3D materials with optimal performance is urgently needed to meet the growing demand of advanced materials in the high&#8208;tech sector. A distinctive 3D graphene (3DG) is designed based on a repeated rebirth strategy to obtain a better body and performance after each round of rebirth, as if it is Phoenix Nirvana. The properties of reborn graphene, namely 3DG after Nirvana (NvG), has been dramatically upgraded compared to 3DG, including high density (3.36 times) together with high porosity, as well as better electrical conductivity (1.41 times), mechanical strength (32.4 times), and ultrafast infiltration behavior. These advantages of NvG make it a strong intrinsic motivation for application in capacitive deionization (CDI). Using NvG directly as the CDI electrode, it has an extremely high volumetric capacity of 220&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3 at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;3 and a maximum salt absorption capacity of 8.02~9.2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;3 (8.9&#8211;10.2 times), while the power consumption for adsorption of the same mass of salt is less than a quarter of 3DG. The &#8220;Phoenix Nirvana&#8221;&#8208;like strategy of manufacturing 3D structures will undoubtedly become the new engine to kick&#8208;start the development of innovative carbon materials through an overall performance upgrade.

         <title>Revamping Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries for High Cell&#8208;Level Energy Density by Synergistic Utilization of Polysulfide Additives and Artificial Solid&#8208;Electrolyte Interphase Layers</title>

         <dc:description>
A practical approach for achieving a high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy density using lithium polysulfides (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes and Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers is presented. The synergistic effects from the LPS and A&#8208;SEI result in superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy densities (&#8776;650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1) and large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. 








Abstract
Despite the high theoretical capacity of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, a high cell&#8208;level energy density and a long cycling life are barely achieved, mainly due to the large electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio, polysulfide (PS) shuttle causing the loss of active sulfur, and the formation of passivation layers on the Li anode. To raise the energy density, holding PS in the cathode has been the most popular approach. Still, it has failed, particularly, when the sulfur loading is high enough to have energy densities similar to those of commercial Li&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a practical approach of achieving high &#8220;cell&#8208;level&#8221; energy densities is attempted using lithium PS (LPS)&#8208;containing electrolytes instead of a pure electrolyte, reducing the electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio and PS diffusion out of the cathode due to concentration differences. Meanwhile, the persistent problems including PS passivation and Li dendrites are suppressed using Li2S&#8208;phobic artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (A&#8208;SEI) layers on Li metal. The synergistic effects from the LPS additives and A&#8208;SEI result in a superior cell&#8208;level volumetric energy density of 650&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 as well as large cumulative energy densities considering cycling life. This approach provides an important stepping stone to realize commercial Li&#8211;S batteries rivaling the current Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Phototriggered Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission and Direct Generation of 4D Soft Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behavior of materials through a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process is reported. With the strategy, laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing and transformable 4D soft patterns of AIE&#8208;active gels are realized.








Abstract
Microscopic control of macroscopic phenomena is one of the core subjects in materials science. Particularly, the spatio&#8208;temporal control of material behaviors through a non&#8208;contact way is of fundamental importance but is difficult to accomplish. Herein, a strategy to realize remote spatio&#8208;temporal control of luminescence behaviors is reported. A multi&#8208;arm salicylaldehyde benzoylhydrazone&#8208;based aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogen (AIEgen)/metal&#8208;ion system, of which the fluorescence can be gated by the UV irradiation with time dependency, is developed. By changing the metal&#8208;ion species, the fluorescence emission and the intensity can also be tuned. The mechanism of the UV&#8208;mediated fluorescence change is investigated, and it is revealed that a phototriggered aggregation&#8208;induced emission (PTAIE) process contributes to the behaviors. The AIEgen is further covalently integrated into a polymeric network and the formed gel/metal&#8208;ion system can achieve laser&#8208;mediated mask&#8208;free writing enabled by the PTAIE process. Moreover, by further taking advantage of the time&#8208;dependent self&#8208;healing property of hydrazone&#8208;based dynamic covalent bond, transformable 4D soft patterns are generated. The findings and the strategy increase the ways to manipulate molecules on the supramolecule or aggregate level. They also show opportunities for the development of controllable smart materials and expand the scope of the materials in advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Post&#8208;Synthesis Functionalization Enables Fine&#8208;Tuning the Molecular&#8208;Sieving Properties of Zeolites for Light Olefin/Paraffin Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile method wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic&#8208;functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.








Abstract
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation and shape&#8208;selective catalysis, but these applications often require discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters and adsorption properties, which are technically challenging to prepare. Nevertheless, it is shown that a wide range of organic functional groups can be covalently functionalized onto the interior pore walls of the zeolites, MOR, LTL, FAU, and MFI, to systematically &#8220;tune&#8221; their effective pore diameters with respect to the size of organic groups. For organic functionalization, small and aggressive organic electrophiles are used (e.g., organo&#8208;halide and &#8208;diazonium) as grafting agents, which are accessible to the intracrystalline void space, forming a C&#8211;Ozeolite bond in a reaction with a bridging oxygen as proved by multiple analysis data. It is demonstrated that the post&#8208;functionalization can be used to tailor the molecular sieving action of a parent zeolite to give size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4&#8208;Methoxybenzene&#8208;functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane with an ideal&#8208;adsorbed&#8208;solution&#8208;theory selectivity of &#8776;5873, whereas toluene&#8208;grafted MOR completely separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular&#8208;sieving properties of zeolites by organic functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

&lt;p&gt;The effective size of zeolite pores is systematically tuned using a versatile method wherein organic molecules are covalently attached to zeolite frameworks via bridging oxygens using an electrophile, thereby obtaining size-selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separations. 4-Methoxybenzene-functionalized MOR separates ethylene from ethane, whereas toluene-grafted MOR separates propylene/propane mixtures. Therefore, tailoring the molecular-sieving properties of zeolites by organic-functionalization broadens their applications to challenging separations.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Black Phosphorus Heterostructures with Improved Ambient Stability and Enhanced Charge Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular engineering strategy is demonstrated to prepare ambient stable black phosphorus (BP)/hexaazatriphenylene (HAT) hybrid heterostructures. This strategy not only modifies the band structure of BP sheets but also improves their charge mobility, paving the way toward ambient processing and fabrication of high&#8208;performance BP&#8208;based devices.








Abstract
Overcoming the intrinsic instability and preserving unique electronic properties are key challenges for the practical applications of black phosphorus (BP) under ambient conditions. Here, it is demonstrated that molecular heterostructures of BP and hexaazatriphenylene derivatives (BP/HATs) enable improved environmental stability and charge transport properties. The strong interfacial coupling and charge transfer between the HATs and the BP lattice decrease the surface electron density and protect BP sheets from oxidation, resulting in an excellent ambient lifetime of up to 21 d. Importantly, HATs increase the charge scattering time of BP, contributing to an improved carrier mobility of 97 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1, almost three times of the pristine BP films, based on noninvasive THz spectroscopic studies. The film mobility is an order of magnitude larger than previously reported values in exfoliated 2D materials. The strategy opens up new avenues for versatile applications of BP sheets and provides an effective method for tuning the physicochemical properties of other air&#8208;sensitive 2D semiconductors.

         <title>Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic&#8211;Organic Isoporous Membranes with Tunable Pore Sizes and Functionalities for Molecular Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes are fabricated via sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition within block copolymer membranes followed by addition of functional organic molecules. The membrane pore sizes are controlled by metal oxide growth in a predictive manner. The hybrid membranes exhibit superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2 nm organic molecules and similar&#8208;sized proteins.








Abstract
Accomplishing on&#8208;demand molecular separation with a high selectivity and good permeability is very desirable for pollutant removal and chemical and pharmaceutical processing. The major challenge for sub&#8208;10&#160;nm filtration of particles and molecules is the fabrication of high&#8208;performance membranes with tunable pore size and designed functionality. Here, a versatile top&#8208;down approach is demonstrated to produce such a membrane using isoporous block copolymer membranes with well&#8208;defined pore sizes combined with growth of metal oxide using sequential infiltration synthesis and atomic layer deposition (SIS and ALD). The pore size of the membranes is tuned by controlled metal oxide growth within and onto the polymer channels, enabling up to twofold pore diameter reduction. Following the growth, the distinct functionalities are readily incorporated along the membrane nanochannels with either hydrophobic, cationic, or anionic groups via straightforward and scalable gas/liquid&#8211;solid interface reactions. The hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity of the membrane nanochannel is significantly changed by the introduction of hydrophilic metal oxide and hydrophobic fluorinated groups. The functionalized membranes exhibit a superior selectivity and permeability in separating 1&#8211;2&#160;nm organic molecules and fractionating similar&#8208;sized proteins based on size, charge, and hydrophobicity. This demonstrates the great potential of organic&#8211;inorganic&#8211;organic isoporous membranes for high&#8208;performance molecular separation in numerous applications.

         <title>Textile Waste Fiber Regeneration via a Green Chemistry Approach: A Molecular Strategy for Sustainable Fashion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A green chemical method for complete separation and regeneration of natural/synthetic blended fabrics is introduced, which aims to provide a universal recycling strategy for fast fashion waste and provide a new source of fibers. Besides single&#8208;component fibers, a new composite fiber consisting of cellulose and wool keratin is also regenerated, which presents unique morphology differing from previous studies.








Abstract
Fast fashion, as a continuously growing part of the textile industry, is widely criticized for its excessive resource use and high generation of textiles. To reduce its environmental impacts, numerous efforts are focused on finding sustainable and eco&#8208;friendly approaches to textile recycling. However, waste textiles and fibers are still mainly disposed of in landfills or by incineration after their service life and thereby pollute the natural environment, as there is still no effective strategy to separate natural fibers from chemical fibers. Herein, a green chemistry strategy is developed for the separation and regeneration of waste textiles at the molecular level. Cellulose/wool keratin composite fibers and multicomponent fibers are regenerated from waste textiles via a green chemical process. The strategy attempts to reduce the large amount of waste textiles generated by the fast&#8208;developing fashion industry and provide a new source of fibers, which can also address the fossil fuel reserve shortages caused by chemical fiber industries and global food shortages caused by natural fiber production.

         <title>Elastic Lattice and Excess Charge Carrier Manipulation in 1D&#8211;3D Perovskite Solar Cells for Exceptionally Long&#8208;Term Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;strictive strain in 3D polycrystalline perovskite is observed, which can lead to an accelerated ion migration under operational conditions. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite, that is, 1D BnPbI3 perovskite, spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film and compensating the dangling bonds in the grain boundaries, can effectively inhibit electro&#8208;strictive  responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, realizing ultralong operational stability.








Abstract
3D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid halide perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) inherently face severe instability issue due to ion migration under operational conditions. This ion migration inevitably results from the decomposition of ionic bonds under lattice strain and is accelerated by the existence of excess charge carriers. In this study, a 1D&#8211;3D mixed&#8208;dimensional perovskite material is explored by adding an organic salt with a bulk benzimidazole cation (Bn+). The Bn+ can induce 3D perovskite crystalline growth with the preferred orientation and form a 1D BnPbI3 perovskite spatially distributed in the 3D perovskite film. For the first time, the electro&#8208;strictive response, which has a significant influence on the lattice strain under an electric field, is observed in polycrystalline perovskite. The 1D&#8211;3D perovskite can effectively suppress electro&#8208;strictive responses and unbalanced charge carrier extraction, providing an intrinsically stable lattice with enhanced ionic bonds and fewer excess charge carriers. As a result, the ion migration behavior of the p&#8208;i&#8208;n 1D&#8211;3D based pero&#8208;SC is dramatically suppressed under operational conditions, showing ultra&#8208;long&#8208;term stability that retains 95.3% of its initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) under operation for 3072 h, and simultaneously achieving an excellent PCE with a hysteresis&#8208;free photovoltaic behavior.

Cancer Immunotherapy
In article number 2106768, Chao Wang and co&#8208;workers develop a 3D&#8208;printed scaffold loaded with immunoregulators for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The 3D&#8208;scaffold with porous structure endows the system with similar functions to real lymphoid organs by the recruitment of a large number of immune cells, leading to the formation of &#8220;artificial tertiary lymphoid structures&#8221; (aTLS), which are promising sites to enhance both humoral and cellular immune responses. Efficient anticancer immunity is induced when combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to inhibit tumor growth and metastasis.

Capacitive Pressure Sensors
Low sensitivity at large pressure has been a long&#8208;lasting obstacle of capacitive pressure sensors. In article number 2103320, Nanshu Lu and co&#8208;workers introduce a hybrid&#8208;response pressure sensor (HRPS), which offers a promising solution to this challenge. By laminating an electrically conductive porous nanocomposite (PNC) with an ultrathin insulating layer, the combined piezoresistivity and piezocapacitivity of the PNC enable up to 423% improvement over existing sensors.

Topological Nodal Line States
A mirror helps light rays to make an image of an object; the mirror planes in a material's crystal structure similarly guide electrons and enhance the properties. In article number 2104126, Chandra Shekhar and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that the abundance of such mirror planes is primarily responsible for topological nodal line states at the Fermi energy in some ferromagnetic metals, leading to a large anomalous Hall conductivity.

Molecular Sieves
Zeolite molecular sieves are widely used in gas separation, but this application often requires discriminating differences as little as 0.1 &#197;. Molecular sieving with such size selectivity demands zeolites with highly tunable pore diameters. In article number 2105398, Michal Mazur, Hae Sung Cho, Changbum Jo, and co&#8208;workers report the development of a versatile method for tuning zeolite micropores by attaching organic molecules to internal bridging oxygens, thereby obtaining size&#8208;selective adsorbents for light olefin/paraffin separation.

         <title>Conquering the Hypoxia Limitation for Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of photodynamic therapy is often restricted by the hypoxic tumor microenvironment (TME). The strategies deve loped to alleviate tumor hypoxia in the past decades are reviewed, including delivering exogenous O2, in situ O2 generation, reducing cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, regulating the TME, and inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has aroused great research interest in recent years owing to its high spatiotemporal selectivity, minimal invasiveness, and low systemic toxicity. However, due to the hypoxic nature characteristic of many solid tumors, PDT is frequently limited in therapeutic effect. Moreover, the consumption of O2 during PDT may further aggravate the tumor hypoxic condition, which promotes tumor proliferation, metastasis, and invasion resulting in poor prognosis of treatment. Therefore, numerous efforts have been made to increase the O2 content in tumor with the goal of enhancing PDT efficacy. Herein, these strategies developed in past decade are comprehensively reviewed to alleviate tumor hypoxia, including 1) delivering exogenous O2 to tumor directly, 2) generating O2 in situ, 3) reducing tumor cellular O2 consumption by inhibiting respiration, 4) regulating the TME, (e.g., normalizing tumor vasculature or disrupting tumor extracellular matrix), and 5) inhibiting the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor 1 (HIF&#8208;1) signaling pathway to relieve tumor hypoxia. Additionally, the O2&#8208;independent Type&#8208;I PDT is also discussed as an alternative strategy. By reviewing recent progress, it is hoped that this review will provide innovative perspectives in new nanomaterials designed to combat hypoxia and avoid the associated limitation of PDT.

This review is intended to provide novel perspectives on the combination of nanocellulose with other electrochemical materials to design and fabricate nanocellulose&#8208;based flexible composites for advanced energy storage devices. First, the unique structural characteristics and properties of nanocellulose are briefly introduced. Second, the structure&#8211;property&#8211;application relationships of these composites are addressed to optimize their performances from the perspective of processing technologies and micro/nano&#8208;interface structure. Next, the recent specific applications of nanocellulose&#8208;based composites, ranging from flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries and electrochemical supercapacitors to emerging electrochemical energy storage devices, such as lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries, sodium&#8208;ion batteries, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, are comprehensively discussed. Finally, the current challenges and future developments in nanocellulose&#8208;based composites for the next generation of flexible energy storage systems are proposed.

         <title>Engineered Bifunctional Proteins for Targeted Cancer Therapy: Prospects and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of various forms of bifunctional proteins (BFPs) for cancer treatment is becoming increasingly popular and important. BFPs can simultaneously act on different components in the tumor microenvironment, which are expected to play a diverse role in combating tumor heterogeneity and improving treatment outcomes. A variety of preclinical and early&#8208;stage clinical studies have reported their great potential in cancer treatment.








Abstract
Bifunctional proteins (BFPs) are a class of therapeutic agents produced through genetic engineering and protein engineering, and are increasingly used to treat various human diseases, including cancer. These proteins usually have two or more biological functions&#8212;specifically recognizing different molecular targets to regulate the related signaling pathways, or mediating effector molecules/cells to kill tumor cells. Unlike conventional small&#8208;molecule or single&#8208;target drugs, BFPs possess stronger biological activity but lower systemic toxicity. Hence, BFPs are considered to offer many benefits for the treatment of heterogeneous tumors. In this review, the authors briefly describe the unique structural feature of BFP molecules and innovatively divide them into bispecific antibodies, cytokine&#8208;based BFPs (immunocytokines), and protein toxin&#8208;based BFPs (immunotoxins) according to their mode of action. In addition, the latest advances in the development of BFPs are discussed and the potential limitations or problems in clinical applications are outlined. Taken together, future studies need to be centered on understanding the characteristics of BFPs for optimizing and designing more effective such drugs.

Microwave ovens can be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various  porous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain nanoporous materials. The recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of these  diverse nanoporous materials and their potential applications are summarized.








Abstract
Usually, porous materials are synthesized by using conventional electric heating, which can be energy&#8208; and time&#8208;consuming. Microwave heating is commonly used in many households to quickly heat food. Microwave ovens can also be used as powerful devices in the synthesis of various porous materials. The microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis offers a simple, fast, efficient, and economic way to obtain many of the advanced nanomaterials. This review summarizes the recent achievements in the microwave&#8208;assisted synthesis of diverse groups of nanoporous materials including silicas, carbons, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and metal oxides. Microwave&#8208;assisted methods afford highly porous materials with high specific surface areas (SSAs), e.g., activated carbons with SSA &#8776;3100 m2 g&#8722;1, metal&#8211;organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;4200&#160;m2 g&#8722;1, covalent organic frameworks with SSA &#8776;2900 m2 g&#8722;1, and metal oxides with relatively small SSA &#8776;300 m2 g&#8722;1. These methods are also successfully implemented for the preparation of ordered mesoporous silicas and carbons as well as spherically shaped nanomaterials. Most of the nanoporous materials obtained under microwave irradiation show potential applications in gas adsorption, water treatment, catalysis, energy storage, and drug delivery, among others.

         <title>Manipulating Intratumoral Fenton Chemistry for Enhanced Chemodynamic and Chemodynamic&#8208;Synergized Multimodal Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 48, December 2, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advances in reinforcement strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction are discussed. Then, multimodal anticancer therapies involving enhanced chemodynamic therapy and mechanisms of synergy are highlighted. Finally, the major challenges and further improvements of this evolving field are elaborated.








Abstract
Chemodynamic therapy (CDT) uses the tumor microenvironment&#8208;assisted intratumoral Fenton reaction for generating highly toxic hydroxyl free radicals (&#8226;OH) to achieve selective tumor treatment. However, the limited intratumoral Fenton reaction efficiency restricts the therapeutic efficacy of CDT. Recent years have witnessed the impressive development of various strategies to increase the efficiency of intratumoral Fenton reaction. The introduction of these reinforcement strategies can dramatically improve the treatment efficiency of CDT and further promote the development of enhanced CDT (ECDT)&#8208;based multimodal anticancer treatments. In this review, the authors systematically introduce these reinforcement strategies, from their basic working principles, reinforcement mechanisms to their representative clinical applications. Then, ECDT&#8208;based multimodal anticancer therapy is discussed, including how to integrate these emerging Fenton reinforcement strategies for accelerating the development of multimodal anticancer therapy, as well as the synergistic mechanisms of ECDT and other treatment methods. Eventually, future direction and challenges of ECDT and ECDT&#8208;based multimodal synergistic therapies are elaborated, highlighting the key scientific problems and unsolved technical bottlenecks to facilitate clinical translation.

         <title>Unraveling the Molar Mass Dependence of Shearing Induced Aggregation Structure of a High Mobility Polymer Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aggregation structure formation of conjugated polymers is a fundamental problem in the field of organic electronics and remains poorly understood. Herein, we thoroughly show the molar mass dependence of the aggregation structure of a high&#8208;mobility conjugated copolymer (TDPP&#8208;Se) comprising thiophene&#8208;flanked diketopyrrolopyrrole and selenophene. Five batches of TDPP&#8208;Se are prepared with number&#8208;average molecular weights (Mn) varied greatly from 21 to 135&#160;kg mol&#8722;1. We combine small&#8208;angle neutron scattering and transmission electron microscopy to probe the solution structure of these polymers, consistently using a deuterated solvent. All the polymers adopt the one&#8208;dimensional (1D) rod&#8208;like aggregation structures and the radius of 1D rod is not sensitive to the Mn while the length increases monotonically with the Mn. By utilizing the ordered packing of the aggregated structure in solution, we prepare highly aligned and ordered film and thereafter realize a reliable hole mobility of up to 13.8 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 in organic thin&#8208;film transistors with the moderate Mn batch via bar coating. The hole mobility is among the highest values reported for diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymers in the literature. This work paves the way to visualize the real aggregated structure of polymer semiconductors in solution state and sheds light on the aggregation structure control of high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>Light&#8208;controlled Nucleation and Shaping of Self&#8208;Assembling Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling self&#8208;assembly of nanocomposites is a fundamental challenge with exciting implications for next&#8208;generation advanced functional materials. Precursors for composites can be generated photochemically, but limited insight in the underlying processes have hindered precise hands&#8208;on guidance. In this study, light&#8208;controlled nucleation and growth is demonstrated for self&#8208;assembling composites according to precise user&#8208;defined designs. Carbonate is generated photochemically using ultraviolet (UV) light to steer the precipitation of nanocomposites of barium carbonate nanocrystals and amorphous silica (BaCO3/SiO2). Using a custom&#8208;build optical setup, the self&#8208;assembly process is controlled by optimizing the photogeneration, diffusion, reaction, and precipitation of the carbonate species, using the radius and intensity of the UV&#8208;light irradiated area and reaction temperature. Exploiting this control, nucleation is induced and the contours and individual features of the growing composite are sculpted according to micrometer&#8208;defined light patterns. Moreover, moving light patterns are exploited to create a constant carbonate concentration at the growth front to draw lines of nanocomposites with constant width over millimeters with micrometer precision. Light&#8208;directed generation of local gradients opens previously unimaginable opportunities for guiding self&#8208;assembly into functional materials.

         <title>Creating A Ferromagnetic Ground State with Tc Above Room Temperature in A Paramagnetic Alloy Through Non&#8208;equilibrium Nano&#8208;structuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Materials with strong magneto&#8208;structural coupling have complex energy landscapes featuring multiple local ground states, thus making it possible to switch among distinct magnetic&#8208;electronic properties. However, these energy minima are rarely accessible by a mere application of an external stimuli to the system in equilibrium state. Here, we report that a ferromagnetic ground state, with Tc above room temperature, can be created in an initially paramagnetic alloy by non&#8208;equilibrium nano&#8208;structuring. By dealloying process we transformed bulk chemically&#8208;disordered FeRh alloys into a nanoporous structure with a topology of a few nanometer&#8208;sized ligaments and nodes. Magnetometry and M&#246;ssbauer spectroscopy revealed the co&#8208;existence of two magnetic ground states &#8208; a conventional low&#8208;temperature spin glass and a hitherto&#8208;unknown robust ferromagnetic phase. The emergence of the ferromagnetic phase is validated by the density functional theory calculations showing that local tetragonal distortion induced by surface stress favors ferromagnetic ordering. Our study provides a means for reaching conventionally inaccessible magnetic states, resulting in a complete on/off ferromagnetic&#8208;paramagnetic switching over a broad temperature range.

However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, we enhance the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveals that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, this study underlines that controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well-defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, we enhance the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)-containing 2DP semiconductors by controllably &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveals that both as-prepared NDI-containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub-2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge-carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron-spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI-radical anions. While the native NDI-based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &amp;gt;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&#160;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;i&gt;S&#160;&lt;/i&gt;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are achieved by substoichiometric levels of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-doping.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Selectivity and &#8220;Order in Disorder&#8221; Engineering in Carbon for Durable and Fast Potassium Storage</title>

Abstract
Defect&#8208;rich carbon materials possess high gravimetric potassium storage capability due to the abundance of active sites, but their cyclic stability is limited because of the low reversibility of undesirable defects and the deteriorative conductivity. Herein, we report an in&#8208;situ defect&#8208;selectivity and order in disorder synergetic engineering in carbon materials via a self&#8208;template strategy to boost the K+ storage capacity, rate capability and cyclic stability simultaneously. The defect&#8208;sites are selectively tuned to realize abundant reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies as well as the sacrifice of poor&#8208;reversible heteroatom&#8208;defects through the persistent gas release during pyrolysis. Meanwhile, the nanobubbles generated during pyrolysis serve as the self&#8208;templates to induce the surface atom rearrangement, thus in&#8208;situ embedding nanographitic networks in defective domains without serious phase separation, which greatly enhance the intrinsic conductivity. The synergetic &#8220;order in disorder&#8221; structure ensures high concentration of reversible carbon&#8208;vacancies and fast charge transfer kinetics simultaneously, leading to high reversible capacity (425 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.05 A g&#8722;1), high&#8208;rate (237.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and superior cyclic stability (90.4% capacity retention from cycle 10 to 400 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1). This work provides a rational and facile strategy to realize the tradeoff between defect sites and intrinsic conductivity, and gives deep insights into the mechanism of reversible potassium storage.

         <title>Multifunctional Nanomachinery for Enhancement of Bone Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The visionary idea that RNA adopts non&#8208;biological roles in today's nanomaterial world has been nothing short of phenomenal. These RNA molecules have ample chemical functionality and self&#8208;assemble to form distinct nanostructures in response to external stimuli. They may be combined with inorganic materials to produce nanomachines that carry cargo to the target sites in a controlled manner and respond dynamically to environmental changes. Comparable to biological cells, programmed RNA nanomachines have the potential to replicate bone healing in vitro. Here, an RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachine has been developed that accomplishes intrafibrillar and extrafibrillar mineralization of collagen scaffolds to mimic bone formation in vitro. Molecular dynamics simulation indicates that noncovalent hydrogen bonding provides the energy source that initiates self&#8208;assembly of these RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines. Incorporation of RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines into collagen scaffolds in vivo creates an osteoinductive microenvironment within a bone defect that is conducive to rapid biomineralization and osteogenesis. Addition of RNA degrading enzymes into the RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines further creates a stop signal that inhibits unwarranted bone formation in tissues other than bone and teeth. The potential of RNA in building functional nanostructures has been underestimated in the past. The concept of RNA&#8208;biomineral nanomachines participating in physiological processes may transform the nanoscopic world of life science.

         <title>NIR&#8208;responsive TiO2 Biometasurface: Towards in situ Photodynamic Antibacterial Therapy for Biomedical Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The implant&#8208;related microbial infection is a challenging clinical problem and its treatment requires efficient eradiation of the biofilm from the implant surface. NIR&#8208;responsive strategies have been proposed as an emerging efficient antibacterial therapy. However, the utilization of photosensitizer or photocatalytic/photothermal nanomaterials in the available approach likely induces high potential risks of interfacial deterioration and biosafety compromise. Herein, TiO2/TiO2&#8208;X metasurface with potent NIR&#8208;responsive antibacterial activity was produced on Ti alloy implant by a newly invented topochemical conversion&#8208;based alkaline&#8208;acid bidirectional hydrothermal method (aaBH). Electromagnetic simulations proved that NIR absorption and near&#8208;field distribution of the metasurface can be tuned by the dimension and arrangement of the nanostructural unit. Promising antibacterial efficacy was proved by both in vitro and in vivo tests, with low power NIR irradiation for 10 mins. Besides, the designed nanostructure in the metasurface itself also showed excellence in enhancing the adhesion&#8208;related gene expression of human gingival fibroblasts that were exposed to 10 mins NIR irradiation, proving the potent nanostructure&#8208;induced biological effects. This work provides a biosafe and upscalable metasurfacing approach with extraordinary capacity of manipulating light adsorption, photocatalysis, and biological properties.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enables High&#8208;performance Thick Ternary Organic Solar Cells via R2R Compatible Slot&#8208;die Coating</title>

Abstract
Power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs) have crossed 18% mark largely fabricated by spin coating, and optimal photoactive thickness is limited to 100&#160;nm. To increase reproducibility of results with industrial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing, we used slot&#8208;die coating coupled with ternary strategy for optimal performance of large are thick OSCs. Based on miscibility differences, we incorporated a highly crystalline molecule BTR&#8208;Cl and regulated the phase separation kinetics of D18:Y6 film. BTR&#8208;Cl provides an early liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation and early aggregation of Y6, which slightly improves the molecular crystallinity and vertical phase separation of ternary blends, resulting in high PCEs of 17.2% and 15.5% for respective thicknesses of 110 and 300&#160;nm photoactive films. Our ternary design strategy for large area and thick films was further utilized to fabricate high&#8208;efficiency flexible devices, which promises reproducibility of our lab results from slot&#8208;die coating to industrial R2R manufacturing.

         <title>Ion Migration in Perovskite Light Emitting Diodes: Mechanism, Characterizations, and Material and Device Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability as well as low&#8208;temperature processability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, perovskite light emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have emerged as a promising new lighting technology with high external quantum efficiency, color purity, and wavelength tunability as well as low-temperature processability. However, the operational stability of PeLEDs is still insufficient for their commercialization. The generation and migration of ionic species in metal halide perovskites has been widely acknowledged as the primary factor causing the performance degradation of PeLEDs. In this review, this topic is systematically discussed by considering the fundamental and engineering aspects of ion-related issues in PeLEDs, including the material and processing origins of ion generation, the mechanisms driving ion migration, characterization approaches for probing ion distributions, the effects of ion migration on device performance and stability, and strategies for ion management in PeLEDs. Finally, perspectives on remaining challenges and future opportunities are highlighted.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>A Universal Approach for Room&#8208;Temperature Printing and Coating of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregated suspensions of 2D materials with high&#8208;enough concentrations can be processed into homogenous gel inks for various printing and coating methods. The stability of the inks, their rheological properties, and film formation behavior mainly depend on their interflake van der Waals interactions, eliminating the need for addition of the conventional additives and enabling their room&#8208;temperature processing.








Abstract
Processing 2D materials into printable or coatable inks for the fabrication of functional devices has proven to be quite difficult. Additives are often used in large concentrations to address the processing challenges, but they drastically degrade the electronic properties of the materials. To remove the additives a high&#8208;temperature post&#8208;deposition treatment can be used, but this complicates the fabrication process and limits the choice of materials (i.e., no heat&#8208;sensitive materials). In this work, by exploiting the unique properties of 2D materials, a universal strategy for the formulation of additive&#8208;free inks is developed, in which the roles of the additives are taken over by van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this new class of inks, which is termed &#8220;vdW inks&#8221;, solvents are dispersed within the interconnected network of 2D materials, minimizing the dispersibility&#8208;related limitations on solvent selection. Furthermore, flow behavior of the inks and mechanical properties of the resultant films are mainly controlled by the interflake vdW attractions. The structure of the vdW inks, their rheological properties, and film&#8208;formation behavior are discussed in detail. Large&#8208;scale production and formulation of the vdW inks for major high&#8208;throughput printing and coating methods, as well as their application for room&#8208;temperature fabrication of functional films/devices are demonstrated.

         <title>Critical Review, Recent Updates on Zeolitic Imidazolate Framework&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67) and Its Derivatives for Electrochemical Water Splitting</title>

Abstract
Design and construction of low&#8208;cost electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity and long&#8208;term stability is a challenging task in the field of catalysis. Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOF) are promising candidates as precursor materials in the development of highly efficient electrocatalysts for energy conversion and storage applications. This review starts with a summary of basic concepts and key evaluation parameters involved in the electrochemical water&#8208;splitting reaction. Then different synthesis approaches reported for the cobalt&#8208;based Zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF&#8208;67) and its derivatives are critically reviewed. Additionally, several strategies employed to enhance the electrocatalytic activity and stability of ZIF&#8208;67 based electrocatalysts are discussed in detail. The present review provides a succinct insight into the ZIF&#8208;67 and its derivatives (oxides, hydroxides, sulfides, selenides, phosphide, nitrides, telluride, heteroatom/metal&#8208;doped carbon, noble metal&#8208;supported ZIF&#8208;67 derivatives) reported for OER, HER, and overall water splitting applications. Finally, this review concludes with the associated challenges and our perspectives on developing the best economic, durable electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Smart Face Mask Based on an Ultrathin Pressure Sensor for Wireless Monitoring of Breath Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) self&#8208;powered pressure sensor developed can output a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow. A portable/wearable smart face mask is obtained based on the sensor and is used for wireless monitoring and analysis of various breath conditions from multiple testers.








Abstract
A smart face mask that can conveniently monitor breath information is beneficial for maintaining personal health and preventing the spread of diseases. However, some challenges still need to be addressed before such devices can be of practical use. One key challenge is to develop a pressure sensor that is easily triggered by low pressure and has excellent stability as well as electrical and mechanical properties. In this study, a wireless smart face mask is designed by integrating an ultrathin self&#8208;powered pressure sensor and a compact readout circuit with a normal face mask. The pressure sensor is the thinnest (totally compressed thickness of &#8776;5.5&#160;&#181;m) and lightest (total weight of &#8776;4.5&#160;mg) electrostatic pressure sensor capable of achieving a peak open&#8208;circuit voltage of up to &#8776;10&#160;V when stimulated by airflow, which endows the sensor with the advantage of readout circuit miniaturization and makes the breath&#8208;monitoring system portable and wearable. To demonstrate the capabilities of the smart face mask, it is used to wirelessly measure and analyze the various breath conditions of multiple testers.

         <title>Bright and Stable Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unprecedently bright, efficient, and stable quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are presented by multilateral approaches, including appropriate modification of the QD structure and optimization of the device architecture, via resolving heat&#8208;related degradation, enhancing light&#8208;outcoupling, and controlling the excitonic states precisely, which expands the applications of QLEDs as a light source.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs) are one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation displays and lighting sources, but they are barely used because vulnerability to electrical and thermal stresses precludes high brightness, efficiency, and stability at high current density (J) regimes. Here, bright and stable QLEDs on a Si substrate are demonstrated, expanding their potential application boundary over the present art. First, a tailored interface is granted to the quantum dots, maximizing the quantum yield and mitigating nonradiative Auger decay of the multiexcitons generated at high&#8208;J regimes. Second, a heat&#8208;endurable, top&#8208;emission device architecture is employed and optimized based on optical simulation to enhance the light outcoupling efficiency. The multilateral approaches realize that the red top&#8208;emitting QLEDs exhibit a maximum luminance of 3&#160;300&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a current efficiency of 75.6&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and an operational lifetime of 125&#160;000&#160;000 h at an initial brightness of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2, which are the highest of the values reported so far.

         <title>Fast Ionic Storage in Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries: From Fundamentals to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The highly dynamic nature of grid&#8208;scale energy systems necessitates fast kinetics in energy storage and conversion systems. Rechargeable aqueous batteries are a promising energy&#8208;storage solution for renewable&#8208;energy grids as the ionic diffusivity in aqueous electrolytes can be up to 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude higher than in organic systems, in addition to being highly safe and low cost. Recent research in this regard has focussed on developing suitable electrode materials for fast ionic storage in aqueous electrolytes. In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and one&#8208;/two&#8208;/three&#8208;dimensional (1D/2D/3D) and over&#8208;3D&#8208;tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over&#8208;3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes have been developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li+, Na+, K+, H+, NH4+, and Zn2+, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.

In this review, breakthroughs in the field of fast ionic storage in aqueous battery materials, and one-/two-/three-dimensional (1D/2D/3D) and over-3D-tunnel materials are summarized, and tunnels in over-3D materials are not oriented in any direction in particular. Various materials with different tunnel sizes have been developed to be suitable for the different ionic radii of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, which show significant differences in the reaction kinetics of ionic storage. New topochemical paths for ion insertion/extraction, which provide superfast ionic storage, are also discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Mechanochemistry Advances High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
A prerequisite for commercializing perovskite photovoltaics is to develop a swift and eco&#8208;friendly synthesis route, which guarantees the mass production of halide perovskites in the industry. Herein, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted mechanochemical strategy is developed for fast synthesizing a stoichiometric &#948;&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3) powder, which serves as a high&#8208;purity precursor for perovskite films deposition with low defects. The pre&#8208;synthesized &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 precursor possesses high concentration of micron&#8208;sized colloids, which are in favor of preferable crystallization by spontaneous nucleation. The resultant perovskite films own preferred crystal orientations of cubic (100) plane, which is beneficial for superior carrier transport compared to that of the films with isotropic crystal orientations using &#8220;mixture of PbI2 and FAI&#8221; as precursors. As a result, high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells with a maximum power conversion efficiency of 24.2% are obtained. Moreover, the &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 powder shows superior storage stability for more than ten months in ambient environment (40&#160;&#177; 10% relative humidity), being conducive to a facile and practical storage for further commercialization.

         <title>Honeycomb&#8208;structure RuI3, a new quantum material related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The layered honeycomb lattice material &#945;&#8208;RuCl3 has emerged as a prime candidate for displaying the Kitaev quantum spin liquid state and as such has attracted much research interest. Here we describe a new layered honeycomb lattice polymorph of RuI3, a material that is strongly chemically and structurally related to &#945;&#8208;RuCl3. The material is synthesized at moderately elevated pressures and is stable under ambient conditions. Preliminary characterization reveals that it is a metallic conductor, with the absence of long&#8208;range magnetic order down to 0.35 K and an unusually large T&#8208;linear contribution to the heat capacity. We propose that this phase, with a layered honeycomb lattice and strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling, provides a new route for the characterization of quantum materials.

         <title>Small&#8208;Dipole&#8208;Molecule&#8208;Containing Electrolytes for High&#8208;Voltage Aqueous Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three kinds of small&#8208;dipole&#8208;molecule&#8208;containing electrolytes are developed for aqueous batteries. The developed electrolytes deliver an expanded electrochemical stability window (over 2.5&#160;V), and their solvation&#8208;sheath structure and ion conductivity mechanism are explored. A constructed Li4Ti5O12//LiMn2O4 battery in a glycerol&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits high output voltage (2.45&#160;V) and a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles.








Abstract
High&#8208;voltage aqueous rechargeable batteries are promising competitors for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems with safety and high specific energy, but they are limited by the absence of low&#8208;cost aqueous electrolytes with a wide electrochemical stability window (ESW). The decomposition of aqueous electrolytes is mainly facilitated by the hydrogen bond network between water molecules and the water molecules in the solvation sheath. Here, three types of small dipole molecules (small molecules containing a dipole; glycerol (Gly), erythritol (Et), and acrylamide (AM)) are reported to develop aqueous electrolytes with high safety and wide ESW (over 2.5&#160;V) for aqueous lithium&#8208;, sodium&#8208;, and zinc&#8208;ion batteries, respectively. The solvation&#8208;sheath structures are explored by ab initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, demonstrating that three types of dipole molecules deplete the water molecules in the solvation sheath of the charge carrier and break the hydrogen bond network between the water molecules, thus effectively expanding the ESW. A battery constructed from lithium titanate and lithium manganate in Gly&#8208;containing electrolyte exhibits an output voltage of 2.45&#160;V and retains a specific capacity of 119.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 400 cycles. This work provides another strategy for exploiting low&#8208;cost high&#8208;voltage electrolytes for aqueous energy&#8208;storage systems.

         <title>Biodegradable Polymer with Effective Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;II Absorption as a Photothermal Agent for Deep Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable photothermal agent is developed by inserting cleavable disulfide moieties into a conjugative polymer, which affords biodegradability and excellent adsorption in both the near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;I and NIR&#8208;II windows, effectively inhibits tumor progression, and extends survival spans in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer mouse model.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy holds great promise for cancer treatment due to its effective tumor ablation and minimal invasiveness. Herein a new class of biodegradable photothermal agents with effective adsorption in both near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) and NIR&#8208;II windows is reported for deep tumor therapy. As demonstrated in a deep&#8208;seated ovarian cancer model, photothermal therapy using 1064&#160;nm irradiation effectively inhibits tumor progression and prolongs survival spans. This work provides a new design of photothermal agents toward a more effective therapy of tumors.

         <title>Heterointerface Engineering in Electromagnetic Absorbers: New Insights and Opportunities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
New and in&#8208;depth insights into the electromagnetic response mechanism of heterointerface engineering are provided, including band alignment, spatial charge, electron transport, lattice defects, lattice strain, and pinning effects. The relevant characterization techniques and reinforcement strategies are systematically demonstrated. Smart electromagnetic absorbers based on interfacial effects are highlighted.








Abstract
Electromagnetic (EM) absorbers play an increasingly essential role in the electronic information age, even toward the coming &#8220;intelligent era&#8221;. The remarkable merits of heterointerface engineering and its peculiar EM characteristics inject a fresh and infinite vitality for designing high&#8208;efficiency and stimuli&#8208;responsive EM absorbers. However, there still exist huge challenges in understanding and reinforcing these interface effects from the micro and macro perspectives. Herein, EM response mechanisms of interfacial effects are dissected in depth, and with a focus on advanced characterization as well as theoretical techniques. Then, the representative optimization strategies are systematically discussed with emphasis on component selection and structural design. More importantly, the most cutting&#8208;edge smart EM functional devices based on heterointerface engineering are reported. Finally, current challenges and concrete suggestions are proposed, and future perspectives on this promising field are also predicted.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Microenvironment&#8208;Activated Reactive Oxygen Species Amplifier for Enzymatic Cascade Cancer Starvation/Chemodynamic /Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment (TME)&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticle (UCNP)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is designed, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to in situ amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation via an open source and reduce expenditure strategy. Furthermore, the chemodynamic therapy (CDT) process can be monitored in real time by the luminescence intensity of the UCNPs core.








Abstract
At present, some progress has been made in the field of cancer theranostics based on nanocatalysts (NCs), but achieving precise theranostics in response to the specific tumor microenvironment (TME) remains a major challenge. Herein, a TME&#8208;responsive upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs)&#8208;based smart UCNPs@Cu&#8211;Cys&#8211;GOx (UCCG) nanosystem is engineered, which combines natural enzymes and nanozymes so as to amplify reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation in situ for cancer starvation/chemodynamic/immunotherapy. One of the biggest merits of this material is that it can be preserved inert (off) in normal tissues, and only in the TME can it be specifically activated (on) through a series of enzymatic cascades to boost ROS production via a strategy of open source (H2O2 self&#8208;supplying ability) and reduce expenditure (glutathione (GSH) consuming ability). More importantly, the enhanced oxidative stress by UCCG NCs reverses the immunosuppressive TME, and facilitates antitumor immune responses. Meanwhile, the starvation/chemodynamic synergistic therapy triggered by UCCG combined with PD&#8208;L1 antibody effectively inhibits the growth of primary tumors and cancer metastasis. In addition, the UCNPs in UCCG present upconversion luminescence enhancement, which can be exploited to visualize the reinforced ROS generation in real time. Collectively, this work provides an original method for the devising and exploitation of UCNPs&#8208;based catalytic immunotherapy.

         <title>Electrically Tunable and Dramatically Enhanced Valley&#8208;Polarized Emission of Monolayer WS2 at Room Temperature with Plasmonic Archimedes Spiral Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized photoluminescence from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is achieved in this manuscript. The degree of valley polarization of WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures at RT can be further enhanced from 40% to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate field effect transistor (FET) device.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have intrinsic valley degrees of freedom, making them appealing for exploiting valleytronic applications in information storage and processing. WS2 monolayer possesses two inequivalent valleys in the Brillouin zone, each valley coupling selectively with a circular polarization of light. The degree of valley polarization (DVP) under the excitation of circularly polarized light (CPL) is a parameter that determines the purity of valley polarized photoluminescence (PL) of monolayer WS2. Here efficient tailoring of valley&#8208;polarized PL from monolayer WS2 at room temperature (RT) through surface plasmon&#8211;exciton interactions with plasmonic Archimedes spiral (PAS) nanostructures is reported. The DVP of WS2 at RT can be enhanced from &lt;5% to 40% and 50% by using 2 turns (2T) and 4 turns (4T) of PAS, respectively. Further enhancement and control of excitonic valley polarization is demonstrated by electrostatically doping monolayer WS2. For CPL on WS2&#8211;2TPAS heterostructures, the 40% valley polarization is enhanced to 70% by modulating the carrier doping via a backgate, which may be attributed to the screening of momentum&#8208;dependent long&#8208;range electron&#8211;hole exchange interactions. The manifestation of electrically tunable valley&#8208;polarized emission from WS2&#8211;PAS heterostructures presents a new strategy toward harnessing valley excitons for application in ultrathin valleytronic devices.

         <title>Surface Chemistry Engineering of Perovskite Quantum Dots: Strategies, Applications, and Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The surface chemistry of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) plays a key role in determining their structural stability and electronic properties. A critical overview focusing on the surface ligand engineering of PQDs, including advanced synthesis, in situ passivation, and ligand exchange, toward efficient and stable optoelectronic applications is presented.








Abstract
The presence of surface ligands not only plays a key role in keeping the colloidal integrity and non&#8208;defective surface of metal halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs), but also serves as a knob to tune their optoelectronic properties for a variety of exciting applications including solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. However, these indispensable surface ligands may also deteriorate the stability and key properties of PQDs due to their highly dynamic binding and insulating nature. To address these issues, a number of innovative surface chemistry engineering approaches have been developed in the past few years. Based on an in&#8208;depth fundamental understanding of the surface atomistic structure and surface defect formation mechanism in the tiny nanoparticles, a critical overview focusing on the surface chemistry engineering of PQDs including advanced colloidal synthesis, in&#8208;situ surface passivation, and solution&#8208;phase/solid&#8208;state ligand exchange is presented, after which their unprecedented achievements in photovoltaics and other optoelectronics are presented. The practical hurdles and future directions are critically discussed to inspire more rational design of PQD surface chemistry toward practical applications.

         <title>High Lift Micro&#8208;Aerial&#8208;Robot Powered by Low Voltage and Long Endurance Dielectric Elastomer Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dielectric elastomer actuators (DEAs) are a special class of artificial muscles that have been used to construct animal&#8208;like soft robotic systems. However, compared with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid actuators such as piezoelectric bimorphs and electromagnetic motors, most DEAs require higher driving voltages, and their power density and lifetime remain substantially lower. These limitations pose significant challenges for developing agile and power autonomous soft robots. Here, a low voltage, high endurance, and power&#8208;dense DEA based on novel multiple&#8208;layering techniques and electrode material optimization, is reported. When operated at 400&#160;Hz, the 143&#160;mg DEA generates forces of 0.36 N and displacements of 1.15&#160;mm. This DEA is incorporated into an aerial robot to demonstrate high performance. The robot achieves a high lift&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of 3.7, low hovering voltage of 500&#160;V, and a long lifetime that exceeds 2 million actuation cycles. With 20 seconds of hovering time, and position and attitude error smaller than 2.5&#160;cm and 2&#176;, the robot demonstrates the longest and best performing flight among existing sub&#8208;gram aerial robots. This important milestone demonstrates that soft robots can outperform the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art rigid counterparts, and it provides an important step towards realizing power autonomy in soft robotic flights.

         <title>A ROS&#8208;Sensitive Nanozyme&#8208;Augmented Photoacoustic Nanoprobe for Early Diagnosis and Therapy of Acute Liver Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Early diagnosis of acute liver failure (ALF) is critical for a curable treatment of the patients, because most existing ALF therapies have narrow therapeutic time windows after disease onset. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), which lead to the sequential occurrences of hepatocyte necrosis and the leakage of alanine aminotransferase (ALT), represent early biomarkers of ALF. Photoacoustic imaging is emerging as a powerful tool for in vivo imaging of ROS. However, high&#8208;performance imaging probes that can boost the photoacoustic signals of short&#8208;lived ROS of ALF are yet to be developed, and there remains a great challenge for ROS&#8208;based imaging of ALF. Herein, we present a ROS&#8208;sensitive nanozyme&#8208;augmented photoacoustic nanoprobe for successful in vivo imaging of ALF. The deep&#8208;penetrated photoacoustic signals of nanoprobe can be activated by the overexpressed ROS in ALF due to the synergy between nanocatalytic bubbles generation and thermoelastic expansion. Impressively, the nanozyme&#8208;augmented ROS imaging enables earlier diagnosis of ALF than clinical ALT method, and the ROS&#8208;activated catalytic activity of nanoprobe permits timely nanocatalytic therapy of ALF.

         <title>Capillary Confinement Crystallization for Monolayer Molecular Crystal Arrays</title>

Abstract
Organic single crystalline semiconductors are highly desired for fabrication of integrated electronic circuits, yet the uniform growth and efficient patterning of them is a huge challenge. Here, a general solution procedure named soft&#8208;template&#8208;assisted&#8208;assembly method (STAA method) is developed to prepare centimeter&#8208;scale monolayer molecular crystal (MMC) arrays with precise regulation over their size and location via capillary confinement crystallization process. It is remarkable that the field&#8208;effect mobility of the array is highly uniform, with variation less than 4.4%, which demonstrates the most uniform organic single crystal arrays ever reported so far. Simulations based on fluid dynamics were carried out to understand the function mechanism of this method. Thanks to the ultrasmooth crystalline orientation surface of MMCs, high&#8208;quality p&#8208;n heterojunction arrays can be prepared by weak epitaxy growth of n&#8208;type material atop the MMC. The p&#8208;n heterojunction FETs show ambipolar characteristics and the corresponding inverters constructed by these heterojunctions exhibit a competitive gain of 155. This work provides a general strategy to realize the preparation and application of logic complementary circuits based on patterned organic single crystals.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Activatable Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission Probe: Intraoperative Pathological Fluorescent Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer via Specific Cathepsin E</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An amphiphilic AIE&#8208;active probe is developed by integrating a biological penetration unit, a cell penetrating peptide, which realizes efficient cell&#8208;penetration ability, with in situ generation of high&#8208;fidelity AIE signals for long&#8208;term tracking of the endogenous overexpressed Cathepsin E enzyme in human PC cells, achieving the intraoperative pathological diagnosis of pancreatic cancer section, and succeeding in tracking xenograft&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing nude BALB/C mice.








Abstract
Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most devastating malignant tumors. However, fluorescence probes for early clinical diagnosis of PC often encounter difficulties in accuracy and penetrability. In this work, an enzyme&#8208;activated aggregation&#8208;induced&#8208;emission (AIE) probe, QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP, for high&#8208;contrast fluorescence diagnosis of PC is developed by monitoring specific overexpressed enzyme Cathepsin E (CTSE). The probe is composed of an AIE fluorophore QM&#8211;COOH (QM = quinoline&#8211;malononitrile), CTSE&#8208;triggered hydrophobic peptide (HSP), and hydrophilic biocompatible cell penetrating peptide (CPP). The CPP unit can well&#8208;modulate the molecular dispersion properties, giving initial fluorescence&#8208;off state in the aqueous biosystem, thus endowing high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio, and finally overcoming the poor targeting selectivity of traditional AIE probes. CPP can ensure cell/tissue penetrating ability, thus allowing on&#8208;site monitoring of endogenous CTSE in PC cells, tissues, and living animal models. When the QM&#8211;HSP&#8211;CPP probe is specifically cleaved by CTSE, it can generate AIE signals in situ with high&#8208;specificity and long&#8208;term tracking ability, and successfully achieve intraoperative diagnosis of human PC sections, tracking PC in heterotopic nude mice models. The CTSE&#8208;enzyme&#8208;triggered AIEgens&#8217; liberation strategy improves accuracy and addresses the penetration problem simultaneously, which can expand the database of multitudinous biocompatible AIE&#8208;active probes, especially for establishing intraoperative pathological fluorescent diagnosis.

         <title>Rational Design of Dot&#8208;on&#8208;Rod Nano&#8208;Heterostructure for Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction: Pivotal Role of Hole Transfer and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dot&#8208;on&#8208;rod (DOR) nano&#8208;heterostructure is rationally constructed by anchoring multiple ZnSe QDs on a single CdS nanorod. Due to the favored energy level alignment and the good exposure of ZnSe to the surrounding medium, ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) charge separation and facile hole utilization are realized, which enable effective and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction taking H2O as an electron donor.








Abstract
Inspired by green plants, artificial photosynthesis has become one of the most attractive approaches toward carbon dioxide (CO2) valorization. Semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) or dot&#8208;in&#8208;rod (DIR) nano&#8208;heterostructures have gained substantial research interest in multielectron photoredox reactions. However, fast electron&#8211;hole recombination or sluggish hole transfer and utilization remains unsatisfactory for their potential applications. Here, the first application of a well&#8208;designed ZnSe/CdS dot&#8208;on&#8208;rods (DORs) nano&#8208;heterostructure for efficient and selective CO2 photoreduction with H2O as an electron donor is presented. In&#8208;depth spectroscopic studies reveal that surface&#8208;anchored ZnSe QDs not only assist ultrafast (&#8776;2&#160;ps) electron and hole separation, but also promote interfacial hole transfer participating in oxidative half&#8208;reactions. Surface photovoltage (SPV) spectroscopy provides a direct image of spatially separated electrons in CdS and holes in ZnSe. Therefore, ZnSe/CdS DORs photocatalyze CO2 to CO with a rate of &#8776;11.3&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and &#8805;85% selectivity, much higher than that of ZnSe/CdS DIRs or pristine CdS nanorods under identical conditions. Obviously, favored energy&#8208;level alignment and unique morphology balance the utilization of electrons and holes in this nano&#8208;heterostructure, thus enhancing the performance of artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;free and Cell&#8208;dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>

Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite of numerous demands and heave clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. Up to date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds own distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functional disparate. In this review, we systematically summarized these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics at the level of mechanisms. For BM, we focused on methodological and theoretical advances; and meanwhile for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds we demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrated osteogenic cell fate. Our summaries of experimental advances and clinical progresses will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

         <title>Structural Insights into Multi&#8208;Metal Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles for Boosting Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multi&#8208;metal oxide (MMO) materials have significant potential to facilitate various demanding reactions by providing additional degrees of freedom in catalyst design. However, fundamental understanding of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs is limited because of the intrinsic complexity of multi&#8208;element nature. Additional complexities arise when MMO catalysts have crystalline structures with two different metal site occupancies, such as spinel structure. Differences in quantum electronic structure and metal&#8211;oxygen bonds and the resulting differences in the tetrahedral and octahedral environments make it more challenging to investigate the origin of the (electro)catalytic activity of MMOs. Here, we synthesize uniform&#8208;sized multi&#8208;metal spinel oxide nanoparticles composed of Mn, Co, and Fe as model MMO electrocatalysts and systematically study the contributions of each element to the structural flexibility of the spinel oxides, which boosts the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. Detailed crystal and electronic structure characterizations combined with electrochemical and computational studies reveal that the incorporation of Co not only increases the preferential octahedral site occupancy, but also modifies the electronic state of the ORR&#8208;active Mn site to enhance the intrinsic ORR activity. As a result, nanoparticles of the optimized catalyst, Co0.25Mn0.75Fe2.0&#8208;MMO, exhibit a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.904&#160;V (versus RHE) and mass activity of 46.9 A goxide&#8722;1 (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.

Detailed crystal and electronic structure characterizations combined with electrochemical and computational studies reveal that the incorporation of Co not only increases the preferential octahedral site occupancy, but also modifies the electronic state of the ORR-active Mn site to enhance the intrinsic ORR activity. As a result, nanoparticles of the optimized catalyst, Co&lt;sub&gt;0.25&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.75&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;2.0&lt;/sub&gt;-MMO, exhibit a half-wave potential of 0.904&#160;V (versus RHE) and mass activity of 46.9 A g&lt;sub&gt;oxide&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (at 0.9&#160;V versus RHE) with promising stability.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>

Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning are causing immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results have been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which provided potential solution to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Hysteresis&#8208;Free Nanoparticle&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The elastic storage and release of mechanical energy has been key to many developments throughout the history of mankind. Resilience, absent hysteresis, has been an elusive goal to achieve, particularly at large deformations. Using a low&#8208;crosslink density polyacrylamide hydrogel at 96% water content having hyper&#8208;branched silica nanoparticles (HBSPs) as the major junction points, we have realized a hysteresis&#8208;free material. The fatigue&#8208;free characteristic of these composite hydrogels is evidenced by the invariance of the stress&#8208;strain curves at strain ratios of 4, even after 5,000 cycles. At a strain ratio of 7, only a 1.3% hysteresis is observed. A markedly increased strain ratio&#8208;at&#8208;break of 11.5 is observed. The unique attributes of these resilient hydrogels are manifested in the high&#8208;fidelity detection of dynamic deformations under cyclic loading over a broad range of frequencies, difficult to achieve with other materials.

         <title>Deciphering Nanoparticle Trafficking into Glioblastomas Uncovers an Augmented Antitumor Effect of Metronomic Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The underlying fate of surface&#8208;modified lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles is directly observed in an intracranial glioblastoma xenograft model. An augmented antitumor effect is further validated directly on glioma cells from the metronomic chemotherapy administration using nanoparticles.








Abstract
Nanoparticles have been explored in glioblastomas as they can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier and target glioblastoma selectively. However, direct observation of nanoparticle trafficking into glioblastoma cells and their underlying intracellular fate after systemic administration remains uncharacterized. Here, based on high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy experiments of an intracranial glioblastoma model, it is shown that ligand&#8208;modified nanoparticles can traverse the blood&#8211;brain barrier, endocytose into the lysosomes of glioblastoma cells, and undergo endolysosomal escape upon photochemical ionization. Moreover, an optimal dose of metronomic chemotherapy using dual&#8208;drug&#8208;loaded nanocarriers can induce an augmented antitumor effect directly on tumors, which has not been recognized in previous studies. Metronomic chemotherapy enhances antitumor effects 3.5&#8208;fold compared with the standard chemotherapy regimen using the same accumulative dose in vivo. This study provides a conceptual framework that can be used to develop metronomic nanoparticle regimens as a safe and viable therapeutic strategy for treating glioblastomas and other advanced&#8208;stage solid tumors.

         <title>Cephalopod&#8208;Inspired Design of Photomechanically Modulated Display Systems for On&#8208;Demand Fluorescent Patterning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display mechanism of cephalopods, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system is developed. Its key component is an NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive fluorescent actuator with desirable time&#8208; and NIR light power dependent actuating behaviors. When paired with customizable display panels, on&#8208;demand display of diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be realized by facilely controlling the single remote NIR signal.








Abstract
Cephalopods can display variable body color/patterns upon environmental stimulation via bioelectricity&#8208;controlled muscle contraction/expansion of skin chromatophores. However, it remains challenging to produce artificial display analogs that exhibit reversible and rapid switching between multiple expected luminescent patterns, although such systems are very appealing for many practical uses (e.g., data encryption). Inspired by the bioelectromechanical display tactic of cephalopods, in this work, a conceptually new photomechanically modulated fluorescent system that enables on&#8208;demand display of fluorescent patterns via a cascading stimulation&#8722;mechanical movement&#8722;optical output conduction mechanism is presented. Specifically, this biomimetic system comprises a customizable hollow display panel and a bottom&#8208;tethered photothermally responsive fluorescent actuator. Under NIR light, the photomechanically bending movements of the fluorescent actuator will immediately cover the hollow window of the display panel and synchronously manifest as the display of fluorescent patterns. Owing to its desirable time&#8208; and light&#8208;power&#8208;dependent actuating behaviors, diverse fluorescent patterns/information can be dynamically and reversibly displayed by facilely controlling this single remote NIR signal. This bioinspired strategy is universal and promising for fabricating on&#8208;demand fluorescent display platforms that combine a wide choice of fluorophores, remote control with high spatial/temporal precision, and especially single&#8208;input multiple&#8208;output features.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cu2O Mesh Pattern on High&#8208;Facet Cu Surface for Selective CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets is developed via insufficient graphene growth and a postoxidation process. The synthesized catalysts show high ethanol selectivity from the electrochemical CO2 reduction. The enhanced CO binding strength due to the introduction of Cu+ induces stable CO adsorption while maintaining high&#8208;facet properties, resulting in a favorable CO&#8211;CO coupling reaction for C2 formation.








Abstract
Although the electroconversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into ethanol is considered to be one of the most promising ways of using CO2, the ethanol selectivity is less than 50% because of difficulties in designing an optimal catalyst that arise from the complicated pathways for the electroreduction of CO2 to ethanol. Several approaches including the fabrication of oxide&#8208;derived structures, atomic surface control, and the Cu+/Cu interfaces have been primarily used to produce ethanol from CO2. Here, a combined structure with Cu+ and high&#8208;facets as electrocatalysts is constructed by creating high&#8208;facets of wrinkled Cu surrounded by Cu2O mesh patterns. Using chemical vapor deposition graphene growth procedures, the insufficiently grown graphene is used as an oxidation&#8208;masking material, and the high&#8208;facet wrinkled Cu is simultaneously generated during the graphene growth synthesis. The resulting electrocatalyst shows an ethanol selectivity of 43% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, which is one of the highest ethanol selectivity values reported thus far. This is attributed to the role of Cu+ in enhancing CO binding strength, and the high&#8208;facets, which favor C&#8211;C coupling and the ethanol pathway. This method for generating the combined structure can be widely applicable not only for electrochemical catalysts but also in various fields.

         <title>Spiderweb Nanomechanical Resonators via Bayesian Optimization: Inspired by Nature and Guided by Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Human creativity, analytical models, and trial&#8208;and&#8208;error experimentation have led to groundbreaking achievements in nanotechnology. In this work, machine learning is shown to offer a new path to discovery, complementing the traditional process. A spiderweb&#8208;inspired sensor is designed and fabricated by this strategy achieving world&#8208;class performance. The algorithm finds a novel vibration mechanism, enabling devices isolated from room&#8208;temperature environments.








Abstract
From ultrasensitive detectors of fundamental forces to quantum networks and sensors, mechanical resonators are enabling next&#8208;generation technologies to operate in room&#8208;temperature environments. Currently, silicon nitride nanoresonators stand as a leading microchip platform in these advances by allowing for mechanical resonators whose motion is remarkably isolated from ambient thermal noise. However, to date, human intuition has remained the driving force behind design processes. Here, inspired by nature and guided by machine learning, a spiderweb nanomechanical resonator is developed that exhibits vibration modes, which are isolated from ambient thermal environments via a novel &#8220;torsional soft&#8208;clamping&#8221; mechanism discovered by the data&#8208;driven optimization algorithm. This bioinspired resonator is then fabricated, experimentally confirming a new paradigm in mechanics with quality factors above 1 billion in room&#8208;temperature environments. In contrast to other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art resonators, this milestone is achieved with a compact design that does not require sub&#8208;micrometer lithographic features or complex phononic bandgaps, making it significantly easier and cheaper to manufacture at large scales. These results demonstrate the ability of machine learning to work in tandem with human intuition to augment creative possibilities and uncover new strategies in computing and nanotechnology.

         <title>Probing Electronic States in Monolayer Semiconductors through Static and Transient Third&#8208;Harmonic Spectroscopies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced optical technique is introduced: broadband static and transient third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopies capture clear fingerprints of relevant electronic states in monolayer semiconductors with an unprecedentedly high contrast ratio up to 200 and further offer a dramatic advance in understanding of exciton dynamics with an ultrafast speed of &#8776;1 ps and high modulation depth up to 94%.








Abstract
Electronic states and their dynamics are of critical importance for electronic and optoelectronic applications. Here, various relevant electronic states in monolayer MoS2, such as multiple excitonic Rydberg states and free&#8208;particle energy bands are probed with a high relative contrast of up to &#8805;200 via broadband (from &#8776;1.79 to 3.10 eV) static third&#8208;harmonic spectroscopy (THS), which is further supported by theoretical calculations. Moreover, transient THS is introduced to demonstrate that third&#8208;harmonic generation can be all&#8208;optically modulated with a modulation depth exceeding &#8776;94% at &#8776;2.18&#160;eV, providing direct evidence of dominant carrier relaxation processes associated with carrier&#8211;exciton and carrier&#8211;phonon interactions. The results indicate that static and transient THS are not only promising techniques for the characterization of monolayer semiconductors and their heterostructures, but also a potential platform for disruptive photonic and optoelectronic applications, including all&#8208;optical modulation and imaging.

         <title>Ultrafast Synthesis of I&#8208;Rich Lithium Argyrodite Glass&#8211;Ceramic Electrolyte with High Ionic Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast synthesis of lithium argyrodite Li6&#8211;xPS5&#8211;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes is accomplished via ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method within 1 h. A 45% S2&#8211;/I&#8211; disorder at 4d sites together with an ionic conductivity over 2 mS cm&#8211;1 is achieved for the optimal Li5.6PS4.6I1.4. The LiI&#8208;containing anodic interface helps solid&#8208;state batteries demonstrate prominent cycling stability and rate performance.








Abstract
Lithium argyrodites are one of the most promising sulfide electrolytes due to their high ionic conductivity and ductile feature. Among them, Li6PS5I (LPSI) exhibits better stability against Li metal but a rather low ionic conductivity (only &#8776;10&#8722;6 S cm&#8722;1) because of the absence of S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder. Herein, argyrodite Li6&#8722;xPS5&#8722;xI1+x glass&#8211;ceramic electrolytes with high iodine content are synthesized using ultimate&#8208;energy mechanical alloying method. S2&#8722;/I&#8722; disorder is successfully introduced into the system by doping LiI during this one&#8208;pot process. Determined by 6Li magic angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, the introduction of iodine promotes Li+ inter&#8208;cage jumps, leading to an enhanced long&#8208;range Li+ conducting. The Li5.6PS4.6I1.4 glass&#8211;ceramic electrolyte (LPSI1.4&#8208;gc) possesses high ionic conductivity (2.04 mS cm&#8722;1) and excellent stability against Li metal. The Li symmetric cell with the LPSI1.4&#8208;gc electrolyte demonstrates ultralong cycling stability over 3200 h at 0.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. LiCoO2/Li6PS5Cl/Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applying LPSI1.4&#8208;gc as the anode interlayer also presents prominent cycling and rate performance. This work provides a novel type of electrolyte with high ionic conductivity and stability against Li metal.

         <title>Single Crystals Heterogeneity Impacts the Intrinsic and Extrinsic Properties of Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The influence of heterogeneities in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) can be enormous at the single&#8208;particle level but is often neglected in characterization due to the lack of microscopes capable of correlated studies on the same crystals. The authors present an analysis platform for correlated, in situ spectroscopy and imaging named MOSAIC, and unveil new heterogeneity&#8211;property relations for two important MOF systems.








Abstract
At present, an enormous characterization gap exists between the study of the crystal structure of a material and its bulk properties. Individual particles falling within this gap cannot be fully characterized in a correlative manner by current methods. The authors address this problem by exploiting the noninvasive nature of optical microscopy and spectroscopy for the correlative analysis of metal&#8208;organic framework particles in situ. They probe the intrinsic as well as extrinsic properties in a correlated manner. The authors show that the crystal shape of MIL&#8208;88A strongly impacts its optical absorption. Furthermore, the question of how homogeneously water is distributed and adsorbed within one of the most promising materials for harvesting water from humid air, MOF&#8208;801, is addressed. The results demonstrate the considerable importance of the particle level and how it can affect the property of the material.

         <title>Coordination Polymer&#8208;Coated CaCO3 Reinforces Radiotherapy by Reprogramming the Immunosuppressive Metabolic Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acidity&#8208;IDO1 modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs) can effectively promote the transition of immunosuppressive (cold) tumor microenvironment to immune&#8208;activated (hot) one via simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and Kyn depletion. In synergizing with AIM NPs injection, treatment with external X&#8208;ray irradiation can effectively suppress the growth of irradiated primary tumors, distant unirradiated (metastatic) tumors, and rechallenged (relapsed) tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Radiotherapy is widely exploited for the treatment of a large range of cancers in clinic, but its therapeutic effectiveness is seriously crippled by the tumor immunosuppression, mainly driven by the altered metabolism of cancer cells. Here, a pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine is prepared by coating calcium carbonate (CaCO3) nanoparticles with 4&#8208;phenylimidazole (4PI), an inhibitor against indoleamine 2,3&#8208;dioxygenase 1 (IDO&#8208;1), together with zinc ions via the coordination reaction, aiming at reinforcing the treatment outcome of radiotherapy. The obtained pH&#8208;responsive nanomedicine, coined as acidity&#8208;IDO1&#8208;modulation nanoparticles (AIM NPs), is able to instantly neutralize protons, and release 4PI to suppress the IDO1&#8208;mediated production of kynurenine (Kyn) upon tumor accumulation. As a result, treatment with AIM NPs can remarkably enhance the therapeutic efficacy of radiotherapy against both murine CT26 and 4T1 tumors by eliciting potent antitumor immunity. Furthermore, it is shown that such combination treatment can effectively suppress the growth of untreated distant tumors via the abscopal effect, and result in immune memory responses to reject rechallenged tumors. This work highlights a novel strategy of simultaneous tumor acidity neutralization and IDO1 inhibition to potentiate radiotherapy, with great promises to suppress tumor metastasis and recurrence by eliciting robust antitumor immunity.

         <title>Quenching&#8208;Resistant Multiresonance TADF Emitter Realizes 40% External Quantum Efficiency in Narrowband Electroluminescence at High Doping Level</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular design tactic to achieve quenching&#8208;resistant multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters is proposed by fencing the MR&#8208;skeleton with steric units. Excellent electroluminescence performances are recorded in corresponding organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, with record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiencies up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum values of only 25&#160;nm.








Abstract
Multiresonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters manifest great potential for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high exciton&#8208;utilization efficiency and narrowband emission. Nonetheless, their tendency toward self&#8208;quenching caused by strong interchromophore interactions would induce doping sensitivity and deteriorate the device performances, and effective strategy to construct quenching&#8208;resistant emitters without sacrifycing color purity is still to be developed. By segregating the planar MR&#8208;TADF skeleton using two bulky carbazolyl units, herein a highly emissive molecule with enhanced quenching resistance is reported. The steric effect largely removes the formation of detrimental excimers/aggregates, and boosts the performance of the corresponding devices with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) up to 40.0% and full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 25&#160;nm, representative of the only example of single OLED that can concurrently achieve narrow bandwidth and high EL efficiency surpassing 40% to date. Even at doping ratio of 30 wt%, the EQEmax is retained to be 33.3% with nearly unchanged emission spectrum. This work provides a viable approach to realize doping&#8208;insensitive MR&#8208;TADF devices with extreme EL efficiency and color purity for high&#8208;end OLED displays.

         <title>Stapled Liposomes Enhance Cross&#8208;Priming of Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with robust structure and bioactive surface that can capture and transport tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) from lysosomes to cytoplasm in dendritic cells, thereby enhancing the TAA cross&#8208;presentation for effective radio&#8208;immunotherapy is demonstrated.








Abstract
The release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) and their cross&#8208;presentation in dendritic cells (DCs) are crucial for radio&#8208;immunotherapy. However, the irradiation resistance of tumor cells usually results in limited TAA generation and release. Importantly, TAAs internalized by DCs are easily degraded in lysosomes, resulting in unsatisfactory extent of TAA cross&#8208;presentation. Herein, an antigen&#8208;capturing stapled liposome (ACSL) with a robust structure and bioactive surface is developed. The ACSLs capture and transport TAAs from lysosomes to the cytoplasm in DCs, thereby enhancing TAA cross&#8208;presentation. l&#8208;arginine encapsulated in ACSLs induces robust T cell&#8208;dependent antitumor response and immune memory in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice after local irradiation, resulting in significant tumor suppression and an abscopal effect. Replacing l&#8208;arginine with radiosensitizers, photosensitizers, and photothermal agents may make ACSL a universal platform for the rapid development of various combinations of anticancer therapies.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the fundamental understanding of the characteristics and challenges of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes of zinc&#8208;ion batteries, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all/quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and goes deep into the discussion on the pros and cons of each electrolyte. Lastly, this review presents a perspective on the challenges and future opportunities for the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes.








Abstract
With the growing demands for large&#8208;scale energy storage, Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with distinct advantages, including resource abundance, low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, and acceptable energy density, are considered&#160;as potential substitutes for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Although numerous efforts are devoted to design and develop high performance cathodes and aqueous electrolytes for ZIBs, many challenges, such as hydrogen evolution reaction, water evaporation, and liquid leakage, have greatly hindered the development of aqueous ZIBs. Developing &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes can be able to avoid these issues due to the absence of water, which are beneficial for the achieving of highly efficient ZIBs. In this review, the recent development of the &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes, including conventional organic electrolytes, ionic liquid, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state, quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes, and deep eutectic electrolytes are presented. The critical issues and the corresponding strategies of the designing of &#8220;beyond aqueous&#8221; electrolytes for ZIBs are also summarized.

         <title>Design of Materials Configuration for Optimizing Redox&#8208;Based Resistive Switching Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Influence of electrode and capping layer materials configuration in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) types of redox&#8208;based resistive random access memory (ReRAM) cells is presented. Cyclic voltammetry reveals different interfacial electrochemical redox processes. The modulation of the resistive switching characteristics by varying the capping layer material in a combination with counter(bottom) electrode configurations are demonstrated and highlighted.








Abstract
Redox&#8208;based resistive random access memories (ReRAMs) are based on electrochemical processes of oxidation and reduction within the devices. The selection of materials and material combinations strongly influence the related nanoscale processes, playing a crucial role in resistive switching properties and functionalities. To date, however, comprehensive studies on device design accounting for a combination of factors such as electrodes, electrolytes, and capping layer materials related to their thicknesses and interactions are scarce. In this work, the impact of materials&#8217; configuration on interfacial redox reactions in HfO2&#8208;based electrochemical metallization memory (ECM) and valence&#8208;change memory (VCM) systems is reported. The redox processes are studied by cyclic voltammetry, and the corresponding resistive switching characteristics are investigated. In ECM cells, the overall cell resistance depends on the electrocatalytic activity of the counter electrode. Nonetheless, the capping layer material further influences the cell resistance and the SET and RESET voltages. In VCM systems, the influence of the electrode material configuration is also pronounced, and is capable of modulating the active resistive switching interface. For both types of memory cells, the switching behavior changes significantly with variation of the oxide thickness. The results present important materials selection criteria for rationale design of ReRAM cells for various memristive applications.

         <title>Double&#8208;Layer Nacre&#8208;Inspired Polyimide&#8208;Mica Nanocomposite Films with Excellent Mechanical Stability for LEO Environmental Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyimide&#8208;mica (PI&#8208;Mica) nanocomposite film with outstanding mechanical properties and atomic oxygen resistance is produced by integrating mica nanosheets with polyimide into a double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica in the top layer. This unique microstructure and advantages of mica also impart the film with favorable resistance to ultraviolet, space debris, and high temperatures.








Abstract
Owing to their outstanding comprehensive performance, polyimide (PI) composite films are widely used on the external surfaces of spacecraft to protect them from the adverse conditions of low Earth orbit (LEO). However, current PI composite films have inadequate mechanical properties and atomic oxygen (AO) resistance. Herein, this work fabricates a new PI&#8208;based nanocomposite film with greatly enhanced mechanical properties and AO resistance by integrating mica nanosheets with PI into a unique double&#8208;layer nacre&#8208;inspired structure with a much higher density of mica nanosheets in the top layer. In addition, the unique microstructure and the intrinsic properties of mica also impart the nanocomposite film with favorable ultraviolet and high&#8208;temperature resistance. The comprehensive performance of this material is superior to those of pure PI, single&#8208;layer PI&#8208;mica, and previously reported PI&#8208;based composite films. Thus, the double&#8208;layer nanocomposite film displays great potential as an aerospace material for use in LEO.

         <title>Silk Embolic Material for Catheter&#8208;Directed Endovascular Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Embolic materials today are clinically approved for achieving vascular occlusion. In this work, a biomaterial comprising silk fibroin and nanoclay is developed and optimized as a multifunctional embolic agent that offers both embolization and drug&#8208;delivery capabilities. The silk embolic material exhibits excellent transcatheter injectability, mechanical strength, biocompatibility, and hemocompatibility to serve as a catheter&#8208;directed embolic drug carrier for the treatment of vascular diseases.








Abstract
Embolization is a catheter&#8208;based minimally invasive procedure that deliberately occludes diseased blood vessels for treatment purposes. A novel silk&#8208;based embolic material (SEM) that is developed and optimized to provide tandem integration of both embolization and the delivery of therapeutics is reported. Natural silk is processed into fibroin proteins of varying lengths and is combined with charged nanoclay particles to allow visibility and injectability using clinical catheters as small as 600 &#956;m in diameter at lengths &gt;100&#160;cm.&#160;SEMs loaded with fluorochrome labeled bovine albumin and Nivolumab, which is among the most used immunotherapy drugs worldwide, demonstrate a sustained release profile in vitro over 28 days. In a porcine renal survival model, SEMs with labeled albumin and Nivolumab successfully embolize porcine arteries without recanalization and lead to the delivery of both albumin and Nivolumab into the interstitial space of the renal cortex. Mechanistically, it is shown that tissue delivery is most optimal when the internal elastic membrane of the embolized artery is disrupted. SEM is a potential next&#8208;generation multifunctional embolic agent that can achieve embolization and deliver a wide range of therapeutics to treat vascular diseases including tumors.

         <title>Highly Efficient Self&#8208;Healing Multifunctional Dressing with Antibacterial Activity for Sutureless Wound Closure and Infected Wound Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;healing elastomer&#8208;based multifunctional wound dressing (MFWD) with desirable mechanical robustness, biocompatibility, and antibacterial activity is developed for effective wound management. MFWD assists in contracting wound edges, based on the excellent self&#8208;healing ability of the elastomer. The wound status can also be comprehensively monitored and reported with this MFWD.








Abstract
Wound healing represents a major clinical and public healthcare problem that is frequently challenged by infection risks, detrimental consequences on the surrounding tissues, and difficulties to monitor the healing process. Here we&#160;report on a novel self&#8208;healing, antibacterial, and multifunctional wound dressing for sutureless wound closure and real&#8208;time monitoring of the healing parameters. The self&#8208;healing elastomer contains cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and has high mechanical toughness (35&#160;MJ m&#8722;3), biocompatibility, and outstanding antibacterial activity (bactericidal rate is &#8776;90% in 12 h), enabling the wound dressing to effectively inhibit bacterial growth and accelerate infected wound healing. In vivo tests based on full&#8208;thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well&#8208;organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real&#8208;time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people&#8208;centred solutions for health care.

In vivo tests based on full-thickness skin incision model shows that the multifunctional wound dressing can help in contracting wound edges and facilitate wound closure and healing, as could be evidenced by notably dense and well-organized collagen deposition. The test provides an evidence that the integrated sensor array within the multifunctional wound dressing can monitor temperature, pH, and glucose level of the wound area in real-time, providing reliable and timely information of the condition of the wound. Ultimately, the reported multifunctional dressing would be of high value in managing the burden associated with wound healing via personalised monitoring and treatment approaches, digital and other people-centred solutions for health care.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Evolution from Lead&#8208;Based to Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics: Engineering of Lattices, Domains, Boundaries, and Defects Leading to Giant Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synergetic combination of conventional and emergent strategies to enhance piezoelectricity, with a deeper understanding of structure&#8211;property relationship using advanced state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques, can lead to a breakthrough in giant piezoelectricity with the desired characteristics.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials are known to mankind for more than a century, with numerous advancements made in both scientific understandings and practical applications. In the last two decades, in particular, the research on piezoelectrics has largely been driven by the constantly changing technological demand, and the drive toward a sustainable society. Hence, environmental&#8208;friendly &#8220;lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics&#8221; have emerged in the anticipation of replacing lead&#8208;based counterparts with at least comparable performance. However, there are still obstacles to be overcome for realizing this objective, while the efforts in this direction already seem to culminate. Therefore, novel structural strategies need to be designed to address these issues and for further breakthrough in this field. Here, various strategies to enhance piezoelectric properties in lead&#8208;free systems with fundamental and historical context, and from atomic to macroscopic scale, are explored. The main challenges currently faced in the transition from lead&#8208;based to lead&#8208;free piezoelectrics are identified and key milestones for future research in this field are suggested. These include: i) decoding the fundamental mechanisms; ii) large temperature&#8208;stable piezoresponse; and iii) fabrication&#8208;friendly and tailorable composition. Strategic insights and general guidelines for the synergistic design of new piezoelectric materials for obtaining a large piezoelectric response are also provided.

         <dc:description>
Thermal monitoring of the human body with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, but powerful route in a wide range of health information standards. Ultrasensitive, and stretchable Au&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array achieved by property modulations of SiNM with the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy offers a general foundation for continuous monitoring of human body temperature.








Abstract
Monitoring the body temperature with high accuracy provides a fast, facile, yet powerful route about the human body in a wide range of health information standards. Here, the first ever ultrasensitive and stretchable gold&#8208;doped silicon nanomembrane (Au&#8208;doped SiNM) epidermal temperature sensor array is introduced. The ultrasensitivity is achieved by shifting freeze&#8208;out region to intrinsic region in carrier density and modulation of fermi energy level of p&#8208;type SiNM through the development of a novel gold&#8208;doping strategy. The Au&#8208;doped SiNM is readily transferred onto an ultrathin polymer layer with a well&#8208;designed serpentine mesh structure, capable of being utilized as an epidermal temperature sensor array. Measurements in vivo and in vitro show temperature coefficient of resistance as high as &#8722;37270.72 ppm &#176;C&#8722;1,&#160;22&#160;times higher than existing metal&#8208;based temperature sensors with similar structures, and one of the highest thermal sensitivity among the inorganic material based temperature sensors. Applications in the continuous monitoring of body temperature and respiration rate during exercising are demonstrated with a successful capture of information. This work lays a foundation for monitoring body temperature, potentially useful for precision diagnosis (e.g., continuous monitoring body temperature in coronavirus disease 2019 cases) and management of disease relevance to body temperature in healthcare.

         <title>Thermally Controlled Charge&#8208;Carrier Transitions in Disordered PbSbTe Chalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is shown experimentally that the carrier type and mobility in Pb&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te thin films can be controlled by annealing the disordered crystal. First&#8208;principles simulations indicate that the unexpected transition from n&#8208; to p&#8208;conduction is caused by a crossover of the predominant point&#8208;defect type with increasing order. Tuning self&#8208;doping properties this way could prove useful for thermoelectric devices and other applications.








Abstract
Binary and ternary chalcogenides have recently attracted much attention due to their wide range of applications including phase&#8208;change memory materials, topological insulators, photonic switches, and thermoelectrics. These applications require a precise control of the number and mobility of charge carriers. Here, an unexpected charge&#8208;carrier transition in ternary compounds from the PbTe&#8211;Sb2Te3 pseudo&#8208;binary line is reported. Upon thermal annealing, sputtered thin films of PbSb2Te4 and Pb2Sb2Te5 undergo a transition in the temperature coefficient of resistance and in the type of the majority charge carriers from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type. These transitions are observed upon increasing structural order within one crystallographic phase. To account for this striking observation, it is proposed that the Fermi energy shifts from the tail of the conduction band to the valence band because different levels of overall structural disorder lead to different predominant types of native point defects. This view is confirmed by an extensive computational study, revealing a transition from excess cations and SbPb for high levels of disorder to PbSb prevailing for low disorder. The findings will help fine&#8208;tune transport properties in certain chalcogenides via proper thermal treatment, with potential benefits for memories, thermoelectric material optimization, and neuromorphic devices.

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Zinc(I) Active Sites to Accelerate Nitrogen Reduction Kinetics for Ammonia Electrosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrocatalyst with single Zn(I) sites is discovered to accelerate kinetics of hydrogenation process for efficient N2 reduction.








Abstract
Developing highly active and stable nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) catalysts for NH3 electrosynthesis remains challenging. Herein, an unusual NRR electrocatalyst is reported with a single Zn(I) site supported on hollow porous N&#8208;doped carbon nanofibers (Zn1N&#8211;C). The Zn1N&#8211;C nanofibers exhibit an outstanding NRR activity with a high NH3 yield rate of &#8776;16.1&#160;&#181;g NH3 h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.3&#160;V and Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 11.8% in alkaline media, surpassing other previously reported carbon&#8208;based NRR electrocatalysts with transition metals atomically dispersed and nitrogen coordinated (TM&#8208;Nx) sites. 15N2 isotope labeling experiments confirm that the feeding nitrogen gas is the only nitrogen source in the production of NH3. Structural characterization reveals that atomically dispersed Zn(I) sites with Zn&#8211;N4 moieties are likely the active sites, and the nearby graphitic N site synergistically facilitates the NRR process. In situ attenuated total reflectance&#8208;Fourier transform infrared measurement and theoretical calculation elucidate that the formation of initial *NNH intermediate is the rate&#8208;limiting step during the NH3 production. The graphitic N atoms adjacent to the tetracoordinate Zn&#8211;N4 moieties could significantly lower the energy barrier for this step to accelerate hydrogenation kinetics duing the NRR.

         <title>Elucidating and Mitigating High&#8208;Voltage Degradation Cascades in Cobalt&#8208;Free LiNiO2 Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2 lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes, which subsequently induces Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults, microscale creep, cracking, and even bending of layers after high&#8208;voltage cycling. By suppressing oxygen evolution, hermetic graphene coatings arrest this degradation cascade, resulting in substantially improved high&#8208;voltage capacity retention.








Abstract
LiNiO2 (LNO) is a promising cathode material for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries due to its exceptionally high capacity and cobalt&#8208;free composition that enables more sustainable and ethical large&#8208;scale manufacturing. However, its poor cycle life at high operating voltages over 4.1&#160;V impedes its practical use, thus motivating efforts to elucidate and mitigate LiNiO2 degradation mechanisms at high states of charge. Here, a multiscale exploration of high&#8208;voltage degradation cascades associated with oxygen stacking chemistry in cobalt&#8208;free LiNiO2, is presented. Lattice oxygen loss is found to play a critical role in the local O3&#8211;O1 stacking transition at high states of charge, which subsequently leads to Ni&#8208;ion migration and irreversible stacking faults during cycling. This undesirable atomic&#8208;scale structural evolution accelerates microscale electrochemical creep, cracking, and even bending of layers, ultimately resulting in macroscopic mechanical degradation of LNO particles. By employing a graphene&#8208;based hermetic surface coating, oxygen loss is attenuated in LNO at high states of charge, which suppresses the initiation of the degradation cascade and thus substantially improves the high&#8208;voltage capacity retention of LNO. Overall, this study provides mechanistic insight into the high&#8208;voltage degradation of LNO, which will inform ongoing efforts to employ cobalt&#8208;free cathodes in Li&#8208;ion battery technology.

         <title>3D Printed, Solid&#8208;State Conductive Ionoelastomer as a Generic Building Block for Tactile Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer is designed for high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of soft ionic conductor with arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks display excellent and temperature&#8208;tolerant electrical&#8211;mechanical properties, as well as can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile devices such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit sensitivities much higher than their bulky counterparts.








Abstract
Shaping soft and conductive materials into preferential architectures via 3D printing is highly attractive for numerous applications ranging from tactile devices to bioelectronics. A landmark type of soft and conductive materials is hydrogels/ionogels. However, 3D&#8208;printed hydrogels/ionogels still suffer from a fundamental bottleneck: limited stability in their electrical&#8211;mechanical properties caused by the evaporation and leakage of liquid within hydrogels/ionogels. Although photocurable liquid&#8208;free ion&#8208;conducting elastomers can circumvent these limitations, the associated photocurable process is cumbersome and hence the printing quality is relatively poor. Herein, a fast photocurable, solid&#8208;state conductive ionoelastomer (SCIE) is developed that enables high&#8208;resolution 3D printing of arbitrary architectures. The printed building blocks possess many promising features over the conventional ion&#8208;conducting materials, including high resolution architectures (even &#8776;50&#160;&#181;m overhanging lattices), good Young's modulus (up to &#8776;6.2&#160;MPa), and stretchability (fracture strain of &#8776;292%), excellent conductivity tolerance in a wide range of temperatures (from &#8722;30 to 80&#160;&#176;C), as well as fine elasticity and antifatigue ability even after 10&#160;000 loading&#8211;unloading cycles. It is further demonstrated that the printed building blocks can be programmed into 3D flexible tactile sensors such as gyroid&#8208;based piezoresistive sensor and gap&#8208;based capacitive sensor, both of which exhibit several times higher in sensitivity than their bulky counterparts.
