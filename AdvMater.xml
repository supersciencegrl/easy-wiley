         <dc:description>
A multifunctional fiber&#8208;enabled intelligent health agent with characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility, enabling health services, is proposed. Four major aspects driven by intelligent agents are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The agent is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine.








Abstract
The application of wearable devices is promoting the development toward digitization and intelligence in the field of health. However, the current smart devices centered on human health have disadvantages such as weak perception, high interference degree, and unfriendly interaction. Here, an intelligent health agent based on multifunctional fibers, with the characteristics of autonomy, activeness, intelligence, and perceptibility enabling health services, is proposed. According to the requirements for healthcare in the medical field and daily life, four major aspects driven by intelligent agents, including health monitoring, therapy, protection, and minimally invasive surgery, are summarized from the perspectives of materials science, medicine, and computer science. The function of intelligent health agents is realized through multifunctional fibers as sensing units and artificial intelligence technology as a cognitive engine. The structure, characteristics, and performance of fibers and analysis systems and algorithms are reviewed, while discussing future challenges and opportunities in healthcare and medicine. Finally, based on the above four aspects, future scenarios related to health protection of a person's life are presented. Intelligent health agents will have the potential to accelerate the realization of precision medicine and active health.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Stretchable Sensor Arrays Exhibiting Magnetoelasticity for Real&#8208;Time Human&#8211;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain sensor based on a flexible NdFeB magnet to realize a wearable and self&#8208;powered sensor is reported, which provides open prospects for real&#8208;time gesture interaction based on an electromagnetic generator and is expected to achieve a wide range of future applications for intuitive and natural human&#8211;machine interfaces.








Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are highly desirable for human motion monitoring, and can be used to build new forms of bionic robots. However, the current use of flexible strain gauges is hindered by the need for an external power supply, and the demand for long&#8208;term operation. Here, a new flexible self&#8208;powered strain sensor system based on an electromagnetic generator that possesses a high stretchability in excess of 150%, a short response time of 30&#160;ms, and an excellent linearity (R2&#160;&gt; 0.98), is presented. Based on this new form of sensor, a human&#8211;machine interaction system is designed to achieve remote control of a robot hand and vehicle using a human hand, which provides a new scheme for real&#8208;time gesture interaction.

         <title>Studying Plasmon Dispersion of MXene for Enhanced Electromagnetic Absorption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The plasmon in MXene plays a role in the electromagnetic absorption, but such an effect has not yet been quantitatively analyzed due to the lack of knowledge of the MXene's plasmon dispersion, which is challengeable to measure for optical methods. The plasmon dispersions for individual MXene nanoflakes with varied thicknesses are measured using high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy.








Abstract
2D metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) are promising candidates for electromagnetic (EM) shielding, saturable absorption, thermal therapy, and photocatalysis owing to their excellent EM absorption. The plasmon resonances in metallic MXene micro/nanostructures may play an important role in enhancing the EM absorption; however, their contribution has not been determined due to the lack of a precise understanding of its plasmon behavior. Here, the use of high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy to measure the plasmon dispersion of MXene films with different thicknesses is reported, enabling accurate analysis of the EM absorption of complex MXene structures in a wide frequency range via a theoretical model. The EM absorption of MXene can be excited at the desired frequency by controlling the momentum (e.g., the sizes of the nanoflakes for EM excitation) as the strength can be enhanced by increasing the layer number and the interlayer distance in MXene. For example, a 3&#160;nm interlayer distance can nearly double the plasmon&#8208;enhanced EM absorption in MXene nanostructures. These findings can guide the design of advanced ultrathin EM absorption materials for a broad range of applications.

         <title>Composition Engineering of Amorphous Nickel Boride Nanoarchitectures Enabling Highly Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of amorphous nickel borides electrocatalysts is developed for the two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), out of which, NiB2 demonstrates remarkable activity, selectivity, and stability. Furthermore, the dependence of 2e&#8722; ORR performance of amorphous nickel borides by tuning the atomic ratio of Ni and B is uncovered from the perspective of free&#8208;adsorption energy and dynamic charge transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Developing advanced electrocatalysts with exceptional two electron (2e&#8722;) selectivity, activity, and stability is crucial for driving the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Herein, a composition engineering strategy is proposed to flexibly regulate the intrinsic activity of amorphous nickel boride nanoarchitectures for efficient 2e&#8722; ORR by oriented reduction of Ni2+ with different amounts of BH4&#8722;. Among borides, the amorphous NiB2 delivers the 2e&#8722; selectivity close to 99% at 0.4&#160;V and over 93% in a wide potential range, together with a negligible activity decay under prolonged time. Notably, an ultrahigh H2O2 production rate of 4.753&#160;mol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 is achieved upon assembling NiB2 in the practical gas diffusion electrode. The combination of X&#8208;ray absorption and in situ Raman spectroscopy, as well as transient photovoltage measurements with density functional theory, unequivocally reveal that the atomic ratio between Ni and B induces the local electronic structure diversity, allowing optimization of the adsorption energy of Ni toward *OOH and reducing of the interfacial charge&#8208;transfer kinetics to preserve the O&#63743;O bond.

         <title>The Third Dimension of Ferroelectric Domain Walls</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls are quasi&#8208;2D systems that show great promise for the development of non&#8208;volatile memory, memristor technology and electronic components with ultra&#8208;small feature size. Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. We demonstrate the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO3. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modelling, we clarify the contribution of domain walls within the bulk and show the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain wall based technology.

Electric fields, for example, can change the domain wall orientation relative to the spontaneous polarization and switch between resistive and conductive states, controlling the electrical current. Being embedded in a 3D material, however, the domain walls are not perfectly flat and can form networks, which leads to complex physical structures. We demonstrate the importance of the nanoscale structure for the emergent transport properties, studying electronic conduction in the 3D network of neutral and charged domain walls in ErMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. By combining tomographic microscopy techniques and finite element modelling, we clarify the contribution of domain walls within the bulk and show the significance of curvature effects for the local conduction down to the nanoscale. The findings provide insights into the propagation of electrical currents in domain wall networks, reveal additional degrees of freedom for their control, and provide quantitative guidelines for the design of domain wall based technology.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ultra&#8208;high porous MgO micro&#8208;particles for heat energy storage</title>

Abstract
Continuous industrial development has increased the demand of energy. Inevitably, the development of energy sources is steadily progressing using various methods. Rather than establishing a new energy source, a system for storing waste heat generated by the industry has now been accepted as a useful strategy. Among such systems, the hydration and dehydration reactions of MgO/Mg(OH)2 are eco&#8208;friendly, have relatively low toxicity and risk, and have a large reserves. Therefore, it is a promising candidate for a heat storage system. In this study, ultra&#8208;high porous particles were used to maximize the heat storage efficiency of pure MgO. Due to its large surface area, the heat storage rate was 90.3% of the theoretical value and the reaction rate was very high. In addition, as structural collapse, likely to be caused by volume changes between reactions, is blocked as the porous region is filled and emptied, the cycle stability is secured. Ultra&#8208;high porous MgO micro&#8208;particles can be used to build eco&#8208;friendly heat storage systems.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Crystalline Conjugated Polymers with Well&#8208;Defined Active Sites for Nitrogen Fixation in Seawater Electrolyte</title>

Abstract
Faradaic efficiency for the nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is often limited by the low N2 solubility in electrolyte while the large number of intimate contacts between the electrolyte and solid catalyst could also inevitably sacrifice many active sites for NRR. Here, we report that a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8208;solid&#8221; interface formed in donor&#8208;acceptor based conjugated polymers is beneficial to boosting the NRR process and at the same time to suppressing the competing hydrogen evolution reaction. Of particular interest, it was found that a semi&#8208;crystalline conjugated polymer catalyst, SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT, exhibits a high Faradaic efficiency up to 60.5% with a maximum NH3 production rate of 16.8&#160;&#956;g h&#8211;1 mg&#8211;1 in a neutral&#8208;buffered seawater electrolyte. Molecular dynamics and COMSOL Multiphysics simulations revealed the origin of the observed high NRR performance arising from the presence of desirable crystal regions to resist the penetration of H2O molecules, leading to the formation of a &#8220;quasi&#8208;gas&#8208;solid&#8221; interface inside the catalyst for a favorable direct&#8208;contact between the catalyst and N2 molecules. Furthermore, high&#8208;throughput computations, based on density functional theory, reveal the actual real active site for N2 adsorption and reduction in SC&#8208;PBDT&#8208;TT. This work provides a new framework for optimizing NRR performance of metal&#8208;free catalysts by controlling their crystallinities.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extreme pool boiling performance is achieved by manipulating liquid&#8211;vapor transport at three length scales by engineering surface structures: 1) at millimeter scale, bubble coalescence is minimized and the complete capillary wicking is exploited with separated nucleation sites, 2) at micrometer scale, microcavities promote vapor nucleation, and 3) at nanometer scale, nanostructures extend the liquid&#8211;vapor interface for enhanced evaporation.








Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy&#8208;transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat&#8208;transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them&#8212;HTC enhancement requires high nucleation&#8208;site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, this trade&#8208;off is overcome by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. The bubble coalescence is minimized to enhance the CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation&#8208;site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. The hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Zwitterion&#8208;Functionalized SnO2 Substrate Induced Sequential Deposition of Black&#8208;Phase FAPbI3 with Rearranged PbI2 Residue</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A zwitterion formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) is deposited at the tin(IV) oxide (SnO2)/perovskite interface to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3), and also help reduce the side effect of the residual lead iodide (PbI2), yielding an impressive power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.1% and 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability.








Abstract
Black&#8208;phase formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) with narrow bandgap and high thermal stability has emerged as the most promising candidate for highly efficient and stable perovskite photovoltaics. In order to overcome the intrinsic difficulty of black&#8208;phase crystallization and to eliminate the lead iodide (PbI2) residue, most sequential deposition methods of FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite will introduce external ions like methylammonium (MA+), cesium (Cs+), and bromide (Br&#8211;) ions to the perovskite structure. Here a zwitterion&#8208;functionalized tin(IV) oxide (SnO2) is introduced as the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) to induce the crystallization of high&#8208;quality black&#8208;phase FAPbI3. The SnO2 ETL treated with the zwitterion of formamidine sulfinic acid (FSA) can help rearrange the stack direction, orientation, and distribution of residual PbI2 in the perovskite layer, which reduces the side effect of the residual PbI2. Besides, the FSA functionalization also modifies SnO2 ETL to suppress deep&#8208;level defects at the perovskite/SnO2 interface. As a result, the FSA&#8211;FAPbI3&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit an excellent power conversion efficiency of up to 24.1% with 1000 h long&#8208;term operational stability. These findings provide a new interface engineering strategy on the sequential fabrication of black&#8208;phase FAPbI3 PSCs with improved optoelectronic performance.

         <title>Corrosion Chemistry of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Corrosion chemistry of electrocatalysts is reviewed, which may inspire more profound research in functional nanomaterials and energy technologies.








Abstract
Electrocatalysts are the core components of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are considered the most potential solution to the worldwide energy and environmental crises. The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by the applied potential, the electrolyte, and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosion, which directly affects the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidates the established structure&#8211;activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts to formulate targeted corrosion&#8208;resistant strategies or use corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry are outlined, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. It is believed that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyond.

     alt="Corrosion Chemistry of Electrocatalysts"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Corrosion chemistry of electrocatalysts is reviewed, which may inspire more profound research in functional nanomaterials and energy technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalysts are the core components of many sustainable energy conversion technologies that are considered the most potential solution to the worldwide energy and environmental crises. The reliability of structure and composition pledges that electrocatalysts can achieve predictable and stable performance. However, during the electrochemical reaction, electrocatalysts are influenced directly by the applied potential, the electrolyte, and the adsorption/desorption of reactive species, triggering structural and compositional corrosion, which directly affects the catalytic behaviors of electrocatalysts (performance degradation or enhancement) and invalidates the established structure&#8211;activity relationship. Therefore, it is necessary to elucidate the corrosion behavior and mechanism of electrocatalysts to formulate targeted corrosion-resistant strategies or use corrosion reconstruction synthesis techniques to guide the preparation of efficient and stable electrocatalysts. Herein, the most recent developments in electrocatalyst corrosion chemistry are outlined, including corrosion mechanisms, mitigation strategies, and corrosion syntheses/reconstructions based on typical materials and important electrocatalytic reactions. Finally, potential opportunities and challenges are also proposed to foresee the possible development in this field. It is believed that this contribution will raise more awareness regarding nanomaterial corrosion chemistry in energy technologies and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrahigh Carrier Mobilities in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Corbino Cones at Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetoresistance is measured in conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in ferroelectric lithium niobate. Extracted carrier mobilities are extremely high, up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides too) and is most comparable to mobilities in other systems typically seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.








Abstract
Recently, electrically conducting heterointerfaces between dissimilar band insulators (such as lanthanum aluminate and strontium titanate) have attracted considerable research interest. Charge transport and fundamental aspects of conduction have been thoroughly explored. Perhaps surprisingly, similar studies on conceptually much simpler conducting homointerfaces, such as domain walls, are not nearly so well developed. Addressing this disparity, magnetoresistance is herein reported in approximately conical 180&#176; charged domain walls, in partially switched ferroelectric thin&#8208;film single&#8208;crystal lithium niobate. This system is ideal for such measurements: first, the conductivity difference between domains and domain walls is unusually large (a factor of 1013) and hence currents driven through the thin film, between planar top and bottom electrodes, are overwhelmingly channeled along the walls; second, when electrical contact is made to the top and bottom of the domain walls and a magnetic field is applied along their cone axes, then the test geometry mirrors that of a Corbino disk: a textbook arrangement for geometric magnetoresistance measurement. Data imply carriers with extremely high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobilities of up to &#8776;3700 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1. This is an unparalleled value for oxide interfaces (and for bulk oxides) comparable to mobilities in other systems seen at cryogenic, rather than at room, temperature.

         <title>Pushing the Natural Frontier: Progress on the Integration of Biomaterial Cues toward Combinatorial Biofabrication and Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The progress on the use of naturally derived materials is reviewed, as well as the integration of cell&#8208;driving cues ranging from biochemical ligands to mechanical properties and the underestimated role of cell&#8211;cell interactions, highlighting unreported synergies and antagonistic combinations, highlighting recent high&#8208;throughput discovery tools toward combinatorial biofabrication and tissue engineering.








Abstract
The engineering of fully functional, biological&#8208;like tissues requires biomaterials to direct cellular events to a near&#8208;native, 3D niche extent. Natural biomaterials are generally seen as a safe option for cell support, but their biocompatibility and biodegradability can be just as limited as their bioactive/biomimetic performance. Furthermore, integrating different biomaterial cues and their final impact on cellular behavior is a complex equation where the outcome might be very different from the sum of individual parts. This review critically analyses recent progress on biomaterial&#8208;induced cellular responses, from simple adhesion to more complex stem cell differentiation, looking at the ever&#8208;growing possibilities of natural materials modification. Starting with a discussion on native material formulation and the inclusion of cell&#8208;instructive cues, the roles of shape and mechanical stimuli, the susceptibility to cellular remodeling, and the often&#8208;overlooked impact of cellular density and cell&#8211;cell interactions within constructs, are delved into. Along the way, synergistic and antagonistic combinations reported in vitro and in vivo are singled out, identifying needs and current lessons on the development of natural biomaterial libraries to solve the cell&#8211;material puzzle efficiently. This review brings together knowledge from different fields envisioning next&#8208;generation, combinatorial biomaterial development toward complex tissue engineering.

         <title>A Memristors&#8208;Based Dendritic Neuron&#160;for High&#8208;Efficiency Spatial&#8208;Temporal Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the microscopic dynamics in biological system, a dynamic memristor as an artificial dendrite and a Mott memristor as a spike&#8208;firing soma are integrated to construct a dendritic neuron for high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Furthermore, a bio&#8208;plausible dendritic neural network is hardware implemented to demonstrate human&#8208;motion recognition, showing nearly 20% improvement in accuracy and 1000&#215;&#160;higher powerefficiency than a&#160;graphics processing unit.








Abstract
Diverse microscopic ionic dynamics help mediate the ability of a biological neural network to handle complex tasks with low energy consumption. Thus, rich internal ionic dynamics in memristors based on transition metal oxide are expected to provide a unique and useful platform for implementing energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic computing. To this end, a titanium oxide (TiOx)&#8208;based interface&#8208;type dynamic memristor and an niobium oxide (NbOx)&#8208;based Mott memristor are integrated as an artificial dendrite and spike&#8208;firing soma, respectively, to construct a dendritic neuron unit for realizing high&#8208;efficiency spatial&#8208;temporal information processing. Further, a dendritic neural network is hardware&#8208;implemented for spatial&#8208;temporal information processing to highlight the computational advantages achieved by incorporating dendritic functions in the network. Human motion recognition is demonstrated using the Nanyang Technological University&#8208;Red Green Blue&#160;(NTU&#8208;RGB) dataset as a benchmark spatial&#8208;temporal task; it shows a nearly 20% improvement in accuracy for the memristors&#8208;based hardware incorporating dendrites and a 1000&#215; advantage in power efficiency compared to that of the graphics processing unit (GPU). The dendritic neuron developed in this study can be considered a critical building block for implementing more bio&#8208;plausible neural networks that can manage complex spatial&#8208;temporal tasks with high efficiency.

         <title>High&#8208;Stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;Hysteresis ConductingPolymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A conducting&#8208;polymer hydrogel strain sensor is proposed with both high stretchability (300% strain) and ultralow hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). The hydrogel&#8208;based sensor harnesses a unique microphase semiseparated network to achieve enhanced sensing properties. The fabricated sensor can be applied as electronic skins to monitor physiological signals, enable a soft gripper for object recognition and remote control of an industrial robot.








Abstract
Highly stretchable strain sensors based on conducting polymer hydrogel are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate toward diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in wearable or robotic systems. Here, a conducting&#160;polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%) is presented. This is achieved through a unique microphase semiseparated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. The overall superior performances of the strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing are systematically characterized. The integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins are further demonstrated to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms toward stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudosymmetric Electron Acceptor</title>

         <dc:description>
A pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F, designed from asymmetric selenium substitution strategy promotes free charge generation to enhance exciton dissociation and suppress energy loss in sequentially processed organic solar cells, leading to a record power conversion efficiency of over 19%.








Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% is realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudosymmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of the D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F is facilitated to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieve a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) can be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. The findings of using pseudosymmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.

         <title>Semi&#8208;Immobilized Ionic Liquid Regulator with Fast Kinetics toward Highly Stable Zinc Anode under &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is designed to protect the Zn anode from &#8722;35 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The protective layer not only promotes Zn2+ desolvation and transport but also regulates Zn2+ concentration gradient and electric field to guarantee uniform Zn deposition. With this novel semi&#8208;immobilized coating technique, highly stable zinc batteries are fabricated and can be operated over a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (ZIBs) have been extensively investigated as a next&#8208;generation energy storage system due to their high safety and low cost. However, the critical issues of irregular dendrite growth and intricate side reactions severely restrict the further industrialization of ZIBs. Here, a strategy to fabricate a semi&#8208;immobilized ionic liquid interface layer is proposed to protect the Zn anode over a wide temperature range from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The immobilized SiO2@cation can form high conjugate racks that can regulate the Zn2+ concentration gradient and self&#8208;polarizing electric field to guarantee uniform nucleation and planar deposition; the free anions of the ILs can weaken the hydrogen bonds of the water to promote rapid Zn2+ desolvation and accelerate ion&#8208;transport kinetics simultaneously. Because of these unique advantages, the cycling performance of the symmetric Zn batteries is greatly enhanced, evidenced by a cycling life of 1800&#160;h at 20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, and a cycle lifespan of 2000&#160;h under a wide temperature window from &#8722;35&#160;to 60&#160;&#176;C. The efficiency of this semi&#8208;immobilizing strategy is well demonstrated in various full cells including pouch cells, showing high performance at large current (20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1) and wide temperatures with extra&#8208;long cycles up to 80&#8201;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Visualizing Dynamic Mechanical Actions with High Sensitivity and High Resolution by Near&#8208;Distance Mechanoluminescence Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Proportionally converting the applied mechanical energy into photons by individual mechanoluminescent (ML) micron&#8208;sized particles opens a new way to develop intelligent electronic skins as it promises high&#8208;resolution stress distribution visualization and fast response. However, a big challenge for the ML sensing technology is its low sensitivity in detecting stress. In this work, we develop a novel stress distribution sensor with the detection sensitivity enhanced by two orders of magnitude, by combining a proposed near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme with an improved mechano&#8208;to&#8208;photon convertor. The enhanced sensitivity is mainly contributed to the realization of a maximum photon harvesting rate of &#8764;80% in the near&#8208;distance ML imaging scheme. The developed near&#8208;distance ML sensor shows a high sensitivity with a detection limit down to &#8764;kPa level, high spatial resolution of 254 dpi, and fast response with an interval of 3.3&#160;ms, which allows for high&#8208;resolution and real&#8208;time visualization of complex mechanical actions such as irregular solid contacts or fluid impacts, and thus enables to be used in intelligent electronic skin, structural health monitoring and human&#8208;computer interaction.

         <title>Volatile Organic Compound&#8208;Sensing Array and Optoelectronic Filter System Using Ion&#8208;Pairing Dyes with a Wide Visible Spectrum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
An ideal dye&#8208;based sensing array has essential design requirements, including facile preparation methodology, tolerance to water vapor, a broad range of color&#8208;responsive changes, and a simple readout system. Here, a brief synthetic route is developed for ion&#8208;pairing dyes exhibiting unusual chromatic changes across the entire visible spectrum. It requires only mixing and precipitation under mild conditions. The dyes are applied to a sensing array containing 12 sensing elements with different initial states. Owing to the numerous color variations of the dyes, the color map generated by the array is highly simple yet sufficiently accurate to distinguish among the different functional groups (such as amines, aldehydes, and carboxylic acids) as well as carbon chain lengths. Principle component analysis (PCA) demonstrates that the volatile organic compounds (VOCs) can be well&#8208;classified according to the color changes of the sensing array. The ion&#8208;pairing dyes are embedded into three&#8208;dimensional (3D) stacked nanofibers via electrospinning, and function as effective harmful&#8208;gas (e.g., formaldehyde) sensors with sub&#8208;ppm theoretical detection limits (0.15&#160;ppm). Finally, the 3D stacked nanofibers can be employed in an optoelectronic filter system, which automatically checks for formaldehyde in the surroundings and also confirms effective removal of the detected formaldehyde by the gas filter cartridge.

Abstract
Semiconducting polymer (SP) holds great promise for cancer phototherapy due to its excellent optical properties; however, its clinical application is still hampered by its poor biodegradability. Herein, we report a self&#8208;sacrificially biodegradable pseudo&#8208;semiconducting polymer (PSP) for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bio&#8208;imaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and photo&#8208;activated chemotherapy (PACT). The PSP could further co&#8208;assemble with an amphiphilic polyester with pendant doxorubicin (DOX) in its side chains via reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;responsive thioketal linkages (PEDOX), which are denoted as NP@PEDOX/PSP. The NP@PEDOX/PSP could accumulate at the tumor sites and generate ROS for photodynamic immunotherapy as well as near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence (NIR&#8208;II) for bioimaging under an 808&#160;nm laser irradiation. The ROS further breaks up thioketal linkages in PEDOX, resulting in rapid doxorubicin (DOX) release for PACT. Finally, both PEDOX and PSP are degraded sacrificially by intracellular glutathione (GSH), resulting in the dissociation of NP@PEDOX/PSP. This work highlighted the application of self&#8208;sacrificially degradable PSP for NIR&#8208;II fluorescence bioimaging, photodynamic immunotherapy, and PACT in cancer therapy.

         <title>SrTiO3/CuNi Heterostructure&#8208;Based Thermopile for Sensitive Human Radiation Detection and Noncontact Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>

Abstract
Noncontact interactive technology provides an intelligent solution to mitigate public health risk from cross infection in the era of COVID&#8208;19. The utilization of human radiation as stimulus source is conducive to the implementation of low&#8208;power, robust noncontact human&#8208;machine interaction. However, the low radiation intensity emitted by human puts forward a high demand for the photodetection performance. Here, we construct a SrTiO3&#8208;x/CuNi heterostructure&#8208;based thermopile, which features the combination of high thermoelectric performance and near&#8208;unity long&#8208;wave infrared absorption, to realize the self&#8208;powered detection of human radiation. The response level of this thermopile to human radiation is orders of magnitude higher than those of low&#8208;dimensional materials&#8208;based photothermoelectric detectors and even commercial thermopiles. Furthermore, a touchless input device based on the thermopile array is developed, which can recognize hand gesture, numbers and letters in real time. This work offers a reliable strategy to integrate the spontaneous human radiation into the noncontact human&#8208;machine interaction system.

         <title>Through the Lens of A Momentum Microscope: Viewing Light&#8208;Induced Quantum Phenomena in Two&#8208;Dimensional Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) materials at their two&#8208;dimensional limit are diverse, flexible, and unique laboratories to study fundamental quantum phenomena and their future applications. Their novel properties rely on their pronounced Coulomb interactions, variety of crystal symmetries and spin&#8208;physics, and the ease of incorporation of different vdW materials to form sophisticated heterostructures. In particular, the excited state properties of many two&#8208;dimensional semiconductors and semi&#8208;metals are relevant for their technological applications, particularly those that can be induced by light. In this paper, we review the recent advances made in studying out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, light&#8208;induced, phenomena in these materials using powerful, surface&#8208;sensitive, time&#8208;resolved photoemission&#8208;based techniques, with a particular emphasis on the emerging multi&#8208;dimensional photoemission spectroscopy technique of time&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy. We discuss the advances this technique has enabled in studying the nature and dynamics of occupied excited states in these materials. Then, we project for the future research directions opened by these scientific and instrumental advancements, studying the physics of two&#8208;dimensional materials and the opportunities to engineer their band&#8208;structure and band&#8208;topology by laser fields.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Photoelectric Detection and Imaging Enhanced By Pyro&#8208;phototronic Effect Based On A Photoinduced Dynamic Schottky Effect in 4H&#8208;SiC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Silicon carbide (SiC), one of the third&#8208;generation semiconductor materials with excellent electrical and optoelectronic properties, is ideal for high light sensing performance. Here, a self&#8208;powered SiC ultraviolet (UV) photodetector (PD) is constructed with wider applicability and higher commercialization potential. The great performance of the PD is realized by a remarkable photoinduced dynamic Schottky effect derived from the symbiotic modulation of Schottky and Ohmic contact. Using the pyro&#8208;phototronic effect existed in the N&#8208;doped 4H&#8208;SiC single crystal PDs, a fast pyroelectric response time of 0.27 s is achieved, which is almost 10 times shorter than that obtained from the steady&#8208;state signal under UV illumination. The maximal transient photoresponsivity reaches 9.12 nA/mW, which is &#8764;20% higher than the conventional photoelectric signal. Moreover, different regions of the 4H&#8208;SiC centimeter&#8208;scale chip output distinct signals under UV illumination, demonstrating efficient optical imaging and information transmission capabilities of this device. This work not only reveals fundamental optoelectronic physics lying in this vital third&#8208;generation semiconductor, but also sheds light on its potential photosensing applications for large&#8208;scale commercialization.

         <title>Tactile Near&#8208;sensor Analogue Computing for Ultrafast Responsive Artificial Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrafast artificial skin enables unprecedented tactile internet applications in prosthetics, robotics, and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, current artificial skin systems that rely on front&#8208;end interface electronics typically perform redundant data transfer and analogue&#8208;to&#8208;digital conversions for decision&#8208;making, causing long latency (milliseconds). Here, we report a near&#8208;sensor analogue computing system based on a flexible memristor array for artificial skin applications. Our system, which seamlessly integrates a tactile sensor array with a flexible hafnium oxide memristor array, can simultaneously sense and compute raw multiple analogue pressure signals without interface electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we used the system for real&#8208;time noise reduction and edge detection of tactile stimuli. One sensing&#8208;computing operation of our system takes about 400&#160;ns and consumes on average 1000 times less power than a conventional interface electronic system. Our results demonstrate that near&#8208;sensor analogue computing offers an ultrafast and energy&#8208;efficient route to large&#8208;scale artificial skin systems.

         <title>Unity of Opposites between Soluble and Insoluble Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on Li&#8211;S chemistry show promise as possible for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices because of their ultra&#8208;high capacities and energy densities. Research over the past decade has demonstrated that the morphology of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in electrolytes (soluble or insoluble) plays a decisive role in battery performance. Early studies have focused mainly on inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs and invested considerable effort to realize this objective. However, in recent years, a completely different view has emerged that the dissolution of LPSs during battery discharge/charge should be promoted. At this critical juncture in the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;S batteries, it is time to summarize and discuss both sides of the contradiction. This perspective provides an overview of these two opposite views pertaining to soluble and insoluble LPSs, including their historical environment, classical strategies, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the future morphology of LPSs in Li&#8211;S batteries is predicted based on a multi&#8208;angle review of research studies conducted thus far, and the reasoning behind this conjecture is thoroughly discussedi.

         <title>Experimental Realization of Atomic Monolayer Si9C15</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Monolayer SixCy, constitutes an important family of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials that is predicted to feature a honeycomb structure and appreciable band gaps. However, due to its binary chemical nature and the lack of bulk polymorphs with layered structure, fabrication of such materials has so far been challenging. Here, we report the synthesis of atomic monolayer Si9C15 on Ru (0001) and Rh(111) substrates. A combination of scanning&#8208;tunneling&#8208;microscopy (STM), X&#8208;ray&#8208;photoelectron&#8208;spectroscopy (XPS), scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations is used to infer that the 2D lattice of Si9C15 is a buckled honeycomb structure. Monolayer Si9C15 shows semiconducting behavior with a band gap of &#8764;1.9&#160;eV. Remarkably, the Si9C15 lattice remains intact after exposure to ambient conditions, indicating good air stability. The present work expands the 2D materials library and provides a promising platform for future studies in nanoelectronics and nanophotonics.

         <title>Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties of Bi2Te3&#8208;based Micro&#8208;nano Fibers Via Thermal Drawing and Interfacial Engineering</title>

Abstract
High&#8208;performance thermoelectric (TE) materials with great flexibility and stability are urgently needed to efficiently convert heat energy into electrical power. Recently, intrinsically crystalline, mechanically stable, and flexible inorganic TE fibers that show TE properties comparable to their bulk counterparts are of interest to researchers. Despite remarkable progress in moving TE fibers towards room&#8208;temperature TE conversion, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit value (ZT) and bending stability still need enhancement. Herein, we report interfacial engineering enhanced thermoelectric properties of micro&#8208;nano polycrystalline TE fibers fabricated by thermally drawing Bi2Te3&#8208;based bulks in a glass&#8208;fiber template. The interfacial engineering effect comes from generating stress&#8208;induced oriented nanocrystals to increase electrical conductivity and producing strain&#8208;distorted interfaces to decrease thermal conductivity. The 4&#8208;&#956;m&#8208;diameter fibers achieve a 40% higher ZT (&#8764;1.4 at 300&#160;K) than their bulk counterparts and show a reversible bending radius of 50&#160;&#956;m, approaching the theoretical elastic limit. This fabrication strategy works for a wide range of inorganic TE materials and benefits the development of fiber&#8208;based micro&#8208;TE devices.

Abstract
As a new class of materials, implantable flexible electrical conductors have recently been developed and applied to bioelectronics. An ideal electrical conductor requires high conductivity, tissue&#8208;like mechanical properties, low toxicity, reliable adhesion to biological tissues, and the ability to maintain its shape in wet physiological environments. Despite significant advances, electrical conductors that satisfy all these requirements are insufficient. Herein, a facile method for manufacturing a new conductive hydrogel through the simultaneous exfoliation of graphite and polymerization of zwitterionic monomers triggered by microwave irradiation is introduced. The mechanical properties of the obtained conductive hydrogel are similar to those of living tissue, which is ideal as a bionic adhesive for minimizing contact damage due to mechanical mismatches between hard electronics and soft tissues. Furthermore, it exhibits excellent adhesion performance, electrical conductivity, non&#8208;swelling, and high conformability in water. Excellent biocompatibility of the hydrogel is confirmed through a cytotoxicity test using C2C12 cells, a biocompatibility test on rat tissues, and their histological analysis. The hydrogel is then implanted into the sciatic nerve of a rat and neuromodulation is demonstrated through low&#8208;current electrical stimulation. This hydrogel has demonstrated a tissue&#8208;like extraneuronal electrode, which possesses high conformability to improve the tissue&#8208;electronics interfaces, promising next&#8208;generation bioelectronics applications.

         <title>Not All Aggregates Are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology, and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solution aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are largely tuned by varying the solvent selectivity toward the backbone versus side chains. This results in three distinct assembly pathways and thin&#8208;film morphologies. Surprisingly, amorphous network aggregates outcompete semicrystalline ones to give rise to highly ordered and aligned morphology and enhanced charge&#8208;transport properties.








Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge&#8208;transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8211;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) are modulated by tuning selectivity of the solvent toward the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain&#8208;associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, and random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, it is demonstrated that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in the solid state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by the dichroic ratio is enhanced by up to 14&#8208;fold, and the charge&#8208;carrier mobility increases by a maximum of 20&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, the assembly pathways and the resulting thin&#8208;film morphology and device properties can be drastically tuned.

         <title>Magneto&#8211;Electric&#8211;Optical Coupling in Multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;Based Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling is realized in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based films at room temperature by engineering ferroelastic switching. The reversible ferroelastic switching is ubiquitous in BiFeO3&#8208;based films with flexible strain states and domain patterns, which is determined by the photoinduced electric field and symmetry mismatch in films. This work provides a framework for multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric memories with low power consumption.








Abstract
Manipulating ferroic orders and realizing their coupling in multiferroics at room temperature are promising for designing future multifunctional devices. Single external stimulation has been extensively proved to demonstrate the ability of ferroelastic switching in multiferroic oxides, which is crucial to bridge the ferroelectricity and magnetism. However, it is still challenging to directly realize multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric coupling in multiferroic oxides as potential multifunctional electrical devices. Here, novel magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic BiFeO3&#8208;based thin films at room temperature mediated by deterministic ferroelastic switching using piezoresponse/magnetic force microscopy and aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy are shown. Reversible photoinduced ferroelastic switching exhibiting magnetoelectric responses is confirmed in BiFeO3&#8208;based films, which works at flexible strain states. This work directly demonstrates room&#8208;temperature magneto&#8211;electric&#8211;optical coupling in multiferroic films, which provides a framework for designing potential multi&#8208;field&#8208;driven magnetoelectric devices such as energy conservation memories.

         <title>2D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Cu3(HHTT)2 Films for Broadband Photodetectors from Ultraviolet to Mid&#8208;Infrared</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic frameworks Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) thin films with desirable properties for optoelectronics are fabricated by a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method. Photodetectors based on the thin films exhibit broad detection range from UV to mid&#8208;IR. Successful application of the devices as optical synapses is also presented.

Abstract
Cu3(HHTT)2 (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13&#8208;hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with efficient in&#8208;plane d&#8211;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films has never been reported until now. Here, the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer&#8208;scale Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films with a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth method on various substrates is presented. Its semiconducting behavior and carrier transport mechanisms are clarified through temperature and frequency&#8208;dependent conductivity measurements. Flexible photodetectors based on Cu3(HHTT)2 thin films exhibit reliable photoresponses at room temperature in a wavelength region from UV to mid&#8208;IR, which is much broader than those of solution&#8208;processed broadband photodetectors reported previously. Moreover, the photodetectors can show a typical synaptic behavior and excellent data recognition accuracy in artificial neural networks. This work opens a window for the exploration of high&#8208;performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on 2D c&#8208;MOFs.

&lt;p&gt;Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (HHTT: 2,3,7,8,12,13-hexahydroxytetraazanaphthotetraphene) is a novel 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c-MOF) with efficient in-plane d&#8211;&#960; conjugations and strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions while the growth of Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films has never been reported until now. Here, the successful fabrication of highly oriented wafer-scale Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films with a layer-by-layer growth method on various substrates is presented. Its semiconducting behavior and carrier transport mechanisms are clarified through temperature and frequency-dependent conductivity measurements. Flexible photodetectors based on Cu&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(HHTT)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; thin films exhibit reliable photoresponses at room temperature in a wavelength region from UV to mid-IR, which is much broader than those of solution-processed broadband photodetectors reported previously. Moreover, the photodetectors can show a typical synaptic behavior and excellent data recognition accuracy in artificial neural networks. This work opens a window for the exploration of high-performance and multifunctional optoelectronic devices based on 2D c-MOFs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties.

Abstract
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. In this work, the efficiency of top&#8208;emission OLEDs (TEOLEDs) is enhanced by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). Moreover, Amp&#8208;MSs can adjust the charge balance by Fermi level (EF) alignment, thereby decreasing the leakage current. The decrease in the wave&#8208;guided modes can enhance the light outcoupling through optical scattering. The resulting TEOLED demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency (EQE) (maximum: 68.7% and average: 63.4% at spectroradiometer; maximum: 44.8% and average: 42.6% at integrating sphere) with a wider color gamut (118%) owing to the redshift of the spectrum by J&#8208;aggregation. Deconvolution of the EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp&#8208;MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical scattering by Amp&#8208;MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1%, and EL by J&#8208;aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic fan Structures in Manganite Homojunction Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Devices with tunable magnetic non&#8208;collinearity are important components of superconducting electronics and spintronics, but they typically require epitaxial integration of several complex materials. Spin&#8208;polarized neutron reflectometry measurements on La1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 homojunction arrays with modulated Sr concentration reported herein have led to the discovery of magnetic fan structures with highly non&#8208;collinear alignment of Mn spins and an emergent periodicity twice as large as the array's unit cell. The neutron data show that these magnetic superstructures can be fully long&#8208;range ordered, despite the gradual modulation of the doping level created by charge transfer and chemical intermixing. The degree of non&#8208;collinearity can be effectively adjusted by low magnetic fields. Notwithstanding their chemical and structural simplicity, oxide homojunctions thus show considerable promise as a platform for tunable complex magnetism and as a powerful design element of spintronic&#160;devices.

         <dc:description>
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite with compressed surface lattice&#8208;structure can be made by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication process, which significantly enhances the ionic activation temperature and contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at high temperature up to 363 K, enabling efficient and stable PSCs fabricated by a high&#8208;speed post&#8208;annealing&#8208;free process in air with the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique.








Abstract
A highly crystalline tempered&#8208;glass&#8208;like perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication is shown. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8722;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and shows enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking&#8208;processed MAPbClxI3&#8722;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully air process without post&#8208;annealing based on the scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 h.

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kirigami&#8208;patterned biodegradable metal electrodes are introduced to achieve biodegradable stretchable batteries with high power and energy density. The elastic electrodes exhibit excellent electrical performance under deformation. Combining molybdenum trioxide with magnesium yields stretchable cells with energy densities as high as 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2. The batteries can power a wearable biosensing patch, enabling on&#8208;skin monitoring of physiological signals.








Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste, and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#181;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological thermal metamaterials are presented. An accurate theoretical framework is established to study the geometric phase and dynamics of the thermal lattices. The topological properties of diffusive systems and localized heat diffusion protected by the topological edge states are revealed. The work can be applied to facilitate the heat dissipation of hot spots.








Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, the above challenges are overcome and systematic studies are performed on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, the band structure and geometric phase are analytically obtained without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. The topological edge state is experimentally demonstrated as localized heat diffusion and its dependence on the boundary conditions is verified. This approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Electrical Sensing of the Thermal and Light&#8208;Induced Spin Transition in Robust Contactless Spin&#8208;Crossover/Graphene Hybrid Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid devices formed by sublimable spin&#8208;crossover molecules deposited over graphene are fabricated. The novel device preparation protocol used results in fast and efficient photoinduced spin transitions, and is even enhanced in devices with a contactless configuration. This methodology allows further integration of spin&#8208;crossover molecules in thermal&#160;or light&#8208;addressable spintronic and straintronic devices based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on spin&#8208;crossover (SCO)/2D heterostructures grant a highly sensitive platform to detect the spin transition in the molecular SCO component and tune the properties of the 2D material. However, the fragility of the SCO materials upon thermal treatment, light irradiation, or contact with surfaces and the methodologies used for their processing have limited their applicability. Here, an easily processable and robust SCO/2D hybrid device with outstanding performance based on the sublimable SCO [Fe(Pyrz)2] molecule deposited over chemical vapor deposition (CVD) graphene is reported, which is fully compatible with electronics industry protocols. Thus, a novel methodology based on growing an elusive polymorph of [Fe(Pyrz)2] (tetragonal phase) over graphene is developed that allows a fast and effective light&#8208;induced spin transition in the devices (&#8776;50% yield in 5&#160;min) to be detected electrically. Such performance can be enhanced even more when a flexible polymeric layer of poly(methyl methacrylate) is inserted in between the two active components in a contactless configuration, reaching a &#8776;100% yield in 5&#160;min.

         <title>Enhanced Photoconductivity at Dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dislocations can boost the photoconductivity in oxide semiconductors. Well&#8208;ordered, high&#8208;density dislocation arrays dedicatedly produced in Fe&#8208;doped SrTiO3 single crystals show manyfold increased photoconductivity in the regions around dislocation compared to the dislocation free regions of the sample.








Abstract
Dislocations are 1D crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>Structure and Evolution of Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Hybrid Electrolytes Formed Inside Electrochemical Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid&#8208;state batteries created by in situ polymerization of a liquid monomer provide a path toward practical electrochemical cells in flexible form factors. In this work, the synthesis and electrochemical properties of hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes formed inside a battery cell using ring&#8208;opening polymerization of DOL&#8208;nanoparticle suspensions are reported. The electrolytes are evaluated in battery cells utilizing both intercalation and conversion cathodes.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) formed inside an electrochemical cell by polymerization of a liquid precursor provide a promising strategy for overcoming problems with electrolyte wetting in solid&#8208;state batteries. Hybrid solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (HSPEs) created by in situ polymerization of a conventional liquid precursor containing electrochemically inert nanostructures are of particular interest because they offer a mechanism for selectively reinforcing or adding&#160;new&#160;functionalities&#160;to the electrolyte&#8212;removing the need for high degrees of polymerization. The synthesis, structure, chemical kinetics,&#160;ion&#8208;transport&#160;properties&#160;and electrochemical characteristics of HSPEs created by Al(OTf)3&#8208;initiated polymerization of 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (DOL) containing hairy, nano&#8208;sized SiO2&#160;particles are reported. Small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering reveals the particles are well&#8208;dispersed in&#160;liquid&#160;DOL. Strong interaction between poly(ethylene glycol) molecules tethered to the SiO2&#160;particles and poly(DOL) lead to co&#8208;crystallization&#8212;anchoring the nanoparticles in their host It also enables polymerization&#8211;depolymerization processes in DOL to be studied and controlled. The utility of the in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed HSPE, is demonstrated first in Li|HSPE|Cu half cells, which manifest Coulombic efficiencies (CE) values approaching 99%. HSPEs are also demonstrated in solid&#8208;state lithium&#8211;sulfur&#8211;polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) composite full&#8208;cell batteries. The in&#8208;situ&#8208;formed Li|HSPE|SPAN cells show good cycling stability and thus provide a promising path toward all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bathochromic shift of a multiple&#8208;resonance&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA) is achieved by introducing cyano groups. The cyano&#8208;substituted material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) exhibits pure green emission with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum. The fabricated organic light&#8208;emitting diode device exhibits a high maximum external quantum efficiency (31.9%), which is maintained (28.5%) at 1000 cd m&#8722;2, demonstrating a minimum efficiency roll&#8208;off.








Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR)&#8208;effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8722;1 is reported. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to Commission Internationale d'&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Single&#8208;Ion Polymer Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;ion polymer conductor (SIPC) with exceptional selectivity for lithium (Li)&#8208;ion conduction is synthesized. The optimized ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li&#8208;ions and carbonyl/cyano groups in the SIPC enable a high ionic conductivity, large Li&#8208;ion transference number, and wide electrochemical stability window. Solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the SIPC exhibit superb cycling performance at various current densities and temperatures.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual&#8208;ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single&#8208;ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt;4.5&#160;V, vs Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8211;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#160;&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8722;20 to 90&#160;&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8211;dipole interaction regulation, sodium&#8208; and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal&#8208;ion systems beyond Li+.

         <dc:description>
The paradigm of in&#8208;sensor computing integrates computing functions into sensory networks, exhibiting high speed, energy efficiency, and computation throughout. The hardware implementation of in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels, and their integration technology are discussed, and perspectives on future development of in&#8208;sensor computing are provided.








Abstract
The number of sensor nodes in the Internet of Things is growing rapidly, leading to a large volume of data generated at sensory terminals. Frequent data transfer between the sensors and computing units causes severe limitations on the system performance in terms of energy efficiency, speed, and security. To efficiently process a substantial amount of sensory data, a novel computation paradigm that can integrate computing functions into sensor networks should be developed. The in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm reduces data transfer and also decreases the high computing complexity by processing data locally. Here, the hardware implementation of the in&#8208;sensor computing paradigm at the device and array levels is discussed. The physical mechanisms that lead to unique sensory response characteristics and their corresponding computing functions are illustrated. In particular, bioinspired device characteristics enable the implementation of the functionalities of neuromorphic computation. The integration technology is also discussed and the perspective on the future development of in&#8208;sensor computing is provided.

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict and Understand Complex Self&#8208;Assembly Behaviors of a Multicomponent Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase behavior of multicomponent nanocomposites is complex and cannot be predicted by theory alone. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative to experimental trial and error. In this work, 595 microscopy images of nanocomposites are used to train a series of ML models. The predictions provide insights into the system and suggest ML can significantly streamline the design of nanocomposites.








Abstract
Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self&#8208;assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure&#8208;dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's formulation and its assembled structure is complex and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends can be strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non&#8208;equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative because they can use existing datasets to map high&#8208;dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscopy images of nanocomposite thin films is used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy visualizes the chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of a single dendronized polymer diffusing in confined organic solvent. Direct observations show the equilibrium and non&#8208;equilibrium chain&#8208;dynamics of semiflexible polymers. The solvated semiflexible chain fluctuates between coiled and stretched conformations. Non&#8208;equilibrium chain motions including drag and cleavage, due to the interfacial interaction, are also observed.








Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semiflexible polymers. These experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single&#8208;chain polymer originate from the degree of intrachain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single&#8208;chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

         <title>A Personalized Electronic Tattoo for Healthcare Realized by On&#8208;the&#8208;Spot Assembly of an Intrinsically Conductive and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Composite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of e&#8208;tattoo that can be directly implemented on the skin by rapid one&#8208;step coating with various designs at a multi&#8208;scale for personalized healthcare is introduced. The e&#8208;tattoo is realized by tuning the electrically conductive and mechanically durable liquid metal composite based suspension to have low repulsion between particles, excellent wettability, and high vapor pressure.








Abstract
Conventional electronic (e&#8208;) skins are a class of thin&#8208;film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here a new class of e&#8208;tattoos is introduced that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one&#8208;step coating with various designs at multi&#8208;scale depending on the purpose of the user without a substrate. An e&#8208;tattoo is realized by attaching Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nanotubes on gallium&#8208;based liquid&#8208;metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low&#8208;zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high&#8208;vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 s. Low&#8208;cost, ease of preparation, on&#8208;skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e&#8208;tattoos. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulators, photothermal patches, motion artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological sensors, and electrochemical biosensors validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e&#8208;tattoo&#8208;based approach in biomedical engineering.

         <title>Single&#8208;crystalline Perovskite p&#8208;n Junction Nanowire Arrays for Ultrasensitive Photodetection</title>

Abstract
Highly sensitive photodetectors play significant roles in modern optoelectronic integrated circuits. Constructing p&#8208;n junctions has been proven to be a particularly powerful approach to realize sensitive photodetection due to their efficient carrier separation. Recently, p&#8208;n junction photodetectors based on organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites, which combine favorable optoelectronic performance with facile processability, hold great potential in practical applications. So far, these devices are generally made of polycrystalline films, which exhibit poor carrier transport efficiency, impeding the further improvement of their photoresponsivities. Here, we demonstrate a type of ultrasensitive photodetectors based on single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8208;n junction nanowire arrays. The single&#8208;crystalline perovskite p&#8208;n junction nanowire arrays not only possess high crystallinity that enables efficient carrier transport but also form a built&#8208;in electric field facilitating effective carrier separation. As a result, the devices show excellent photosensitivity over a wide spectral range from 405&#160;nm to 635&#160;nm with an outstanding responsivity of 2.65 &#215; 102 A/W at 532&#160;nm. These results would provide new insights into the design and construction of high&#8208;performance photodetectors for practical optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Concentrated Electrolytes Enabling Stable Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, and electrode&#8211;electrolyte interphase of a novel concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte are unveiled by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The unique solvation structure of the concentrated electrolyte and the formed surface layer guarantee the full cell with a capacity retention of &#8776;72% and a coulombic efficiency of 99.2% after 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising devices for large&#8208;scale energy&#8208;storage applications because of their low&#8208;cost, inherent safety, and environmental friendliness. Among them, aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are currently emerging owing to the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to obtain stable AAIB with relatively high output potential, considering the instability of many electrode materials in an aqueous environment. Herein, a cell based on a concentrated (5.8 m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte, ammonium copper hexacyanoferrate (N&#8208;CuHCF) as the positive electrode (cathode), and 3,4,9,10&#8208;perylene&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) as the negative electrode (anode) is reported. The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, as well as the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface and interphase are systematically investigated by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The results indicate a remarkable cycling performance of the low&#8208;cost rocking&#8208;chair AAIB, which offers a capacity retention of &#8776;72% after 1000 cycles and an average output potential of &#8776;1.0&#160;V.

         <title>Tensile&#8208;Strained Palladium Nanosheets for Synthetic Catalytic Therapy and Phototherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface reconstruction strategy is reported for the fabrication of lattice&#8208;tensile&#8208;strained Pd nanosheets with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. The in vivo tumor inhibition rate in a 4T1&#8208;tumor&#8208;bearing mice model of the strained Pd nanosheets is approximately five times higher than that of the pristine Pd nanosheets.








Abstract
Palladium nanosheets (Pd NSs) are well&#8208;investigated photothermal therapy agents, but their catalytic potential for tumor therapy has been underexplored owing to the inactive dominant (111) facets. Herein, lattice tensile strain is introduced by surface reconstruction to activate the inert surface, endowing the strained Pd NSs (SPd NSs) with photodynamic, catalase&#8208;like, and peroxidase&#8208;like properties. Tensile strain promoting the photodynamic and enzyme&#8208;like activities is revealed by density functional theory calculations. Compared with Pd NSs, SPd NSs exhibit lower photothermal effect, but approximately five times higher tumor inhibition rate. This work calls for further study to activate nanomaterials by strain engineering and surface reconstruction for catalytic therapy of tumors.

         <title>A room temperature ferroelectric resonant tunnelling diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Resonant tunnelling is a quantum&#8208;mechanical effect in which electron transport is controlled by the discrete energy levels within a quantum well (QW) structure. A ferroelectric resonant tunnelling diode exploits the switchable electric polarization state of the QW barrier to tune the device resistance. Here, we report the discovery of robust room&#8208;temperature ferroelectric modulated resonant tunnelling and negative differential resistance (NDR) behaviours in all perovskite oxide BaTiO3/SrRuO3/BaTiO3 QW structures. The resonant current amplitude and voltage are tuneable by the switchable polarization of the BaTiO3 ferroelectric with the NDR ratio modulated by &#8764;3 orders of magnitude and an OFF/ON resistance ratio exceeding a factor of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The observed NDR effect is explained an energy band gap between Ru&#8208;t2g and Ru&#8208;eg orbitals driven by electron&#8208;electron correlations, as follows from our density&#8208;functional theory calculations. Our study paves the way for ferroelectric&#8208;based quantum&#8208;tunnelling devices in future oxide electronics.

         <title>Multiscale Functional Metal Architectures by Antibody&#8208;Guided Metallization of Specific Protein Assemblies in Ex Vivo Multicellular Organisms</title>

Abstract
Biological systems consist of hierarchical protein structures, each of which has unique three&#8208;dimensional (3D) geometries optimized for specific functions. In the past decades, the growth of inorganic materials on specific proteins has attracted considerable attention. However, the use of specific proteins as templates has only been demonstrated in relatively simple organisms, such as viruses, limiting the range of structures that can be used as scaffolds. This study proposes a method for synthesizing metallic structures that resemble the 3D assemblies of specific proteins in mammalian cells and animal tissue. Using 1.4&#8208;nm nanogold&#8208;conjugated antibodies, specific proteins within cells and ex vivo tissue are labeled, and then nanogold acts as nucleation sites for metal particle growth. As proof of concept, various metal particles are grown using microtubules in cells as templates. The metal&#8208;containing cells are applied as catalysts and show catalytic stability in liquid&#8208;phase reactions due to the rigid support provided by the microtubules. Finally, this method is used to produce metal structures that replicate the specific protein assemblies of neurons in mouse brain or the extracellular matrices in mouse kidney and heart. This new biotemplating approach can facilitate the conversion of specific protein structures into metallic forms in ex vivo multicellular organisms.

         <title>Rapid Ultra&#8208;Tough Topological Tissue Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tissue adhesives capable of achieving strong and tough adhesion in permeable wet environments are useful in many biomedical applications. However, adhesion generated through covalent bond formation directly with the functional groups of tissues (i.e., &#8208;COOH and &#8208;NH2 groups in collagen), or using non&#8208;covalent interactions can both be limited by weak, unstable, or slow adhesion. Here, we show that by combining pH&#8208;responsive bridging chitosan polymer chains and a tough hydrogel dissipative matrix one can achieve unprecedented ultra&#8208;tough adhesion to tissues (&gt;2000J/m2) in 5&#8211;10mins without covalent bond formation. The strong non&#8208;covalent adhesion was shown to be stable under physiologically relevant conditions and strongly influenced by chitosan molecular weight, molecular weight of polymers in the matrix, and pH. The adhesion mechanism relies primarily on the topological entanglement between the chitosan chains and the permeable adherends. To further expand the applicability of the adhesives, adhesion time can be decreased by dehydrating the hydrogel matrix to facilitate rapid chitosan interpenetration and entanglement (&gt;1000J/m2 in &#8804;1&#160;min). The unprecedented adhesive properties presented in this study open opportunities for new strategies in the development of non&#8208;covalent tissue adhesives and numerous bio&#8208;applications.

         <title>Exposing Single&#8208;Ni Atoms in Hollow S/N&#8208;doped Carbon Macroporous Fibers for Highly Efficient Electrochemical Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The development of efficient and cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts towards the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is highly desirable for clean energy and fuel conversion. Herein, we report the facile preparation of Ni single atoms embedded hollow S/N&#8208;doped carbon macroporous fibers (Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF) as efficient catalysts for OER through pyrolysis of designed CdS&#8208;NiSx/polyacrylonitrile composite fibers. Specifically, CdS provides the sulfur source for the doping of polyacrylonitrile&#8208;derived carbon matrix and simultaneously creates the hollow macroporous structure, while NiSx is first reduced to nanoparticles and finally evolves into single&#8208;Ni atoms through the atom migration&#8208;trapping strategy. Benefiting from the abundantly exposed single&#8208;Ni atoms and hollow macroporous structure, the resultant Ni SAs@S/N&#8208;CMF electrocatalysts deliver outstanding activity and stability for OER. Specifically, it needs an overpotential of 285&#160;mV to achieve the benchmark current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a small Tafel slope of 50.8&#160;mV dec&#8722;1.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematically theoretical calculations are performed to seek the optimal catalyst from transition metal nitrides for room&#8208;temperature advanced Na&#8211;S batteries. Based on theoretical results, a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs) is designed and synthesized for S and Na electrodes, which exhibits superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8211;sulfur (RT Na&#8211;S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration, and electronic concentration around the Fermi level are systematically proposed as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na&#8211;S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared RT Na&#8211;S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. Even with high S loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the RT Na&#8211;S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm&#8211;2.

         <title>Superior Fast&#8208;Charging Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries Enabled by the High&#8208;Speed Solid&#8208;State Lithium Transport of an Intermetallic Cu6Sn5 Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;transport matrix throughout the electrode is built up by a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network, which largely reduces the polarization effect in the graphite anode and realizes superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells under strict electrode conditions (areal capacity &gt;3 mAh cm&#8722;2, porosity &lt; 35%).








Abstract
Superior fast charging is a desirable capability of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which can make electric vehicles a strong competition to traditional fuel vehicles. However, the slow transport of solvated lithium ions in liquid electrolytes is a limiting factor. Here, a LixCu6Sn5 intermetallic network is reported to address this issue. Based on electrochemical analysis and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy mapping, it is demonstrated that the reported intermetallic network can form a high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport matrix throughout the electrode, which largely reduces the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;concentration polarization effect in the graphite anode. Employing this design, superior fast&#8208;charging graphite/lithium cobalt oxide full cells are fabricated and tested under strict electrode conditions. At the charging rate of 6 C, the fabricated full cells show a capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 with an extraordinary capacity retention of 96.6%. In addition, the full cell also exhibits good electrochemical stability at a high charging rate of 2 C over 100 cycles (96.0% of capacity retention) in comparison to traditional graphite&#8208;anode&#8208;based cells (86.1% of capacity retention). This work presents a new strategy for fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries on the basis of high&#8208;speed solid&#8208;state lithium transport in intermetallic alloy hosts.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Dot Perovskite Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;dot perovskite spectrometer is demonstrated, which first breaks the long&#8208;standing restriction of footprint&#8208;resolution. The control of ion migration in the perovskite is the key of the spectrum richness and cyclic stability. Without any optical and mechanical structure, the spectrum can be recognized by a single detector through the bias stimulated photogain modulation.








Abstract
There are significant applications for miniature on&#8208;chip spectrometers in many fields. However, at present, on&#8208;chip spectrometers have to utilize an integrated strategy to achieve spectral analysis, which undoubtedly squanders the photosensitive area and adds pressure to the miniaturization of the spectrometer. Here, a unique spectrometer design that adopts a single detection point with in situ modulation realized by the photogain control at various bias voltages is demonstrated. With micrometer&#8208;level footprints, this single&#8208;dot spectrometer processes a resolution of about 5&#160;nm and a response time down to about 197 &#181;s. This is the first in situ perovskite modulation strategy that breaks the footprint&#8208;resolution restriction of spectrum analysis and demonstrates a new design direction for functional perovskite devices.

         <title>Drug in Drug: A Host&#8211;Guest Formulation of Azocalixarene with Hydroxychloroquine for Synergistic Anti&#8208;Inflammation</title>

Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two hotspots in supramolecular biomedicine that have only been occasionally merged. In this work, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a therapeutically active macrocycle, forming a multifunctional supramolecular active ingredient. This drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug formulation achieves the advantages of macrocycles acting as both carriers and therapeutic agents to realize combinational therapy.








Abstract
Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two significant topics in supramolecular biomedicine. The functional integration of these topics would open new avenues for treating diseases synergistically. However, these two individual topics have only been occasionally merged, probably because of the lack of functionalized design of macrocyclic host and the lack of efficient recognition between host and guest drugs. Herein, a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy is proposed, in which an active drug is encapsulated by a macrocycle possessing therapeutic activity to form a multifunctional supramolecular active pharmaceutical ingredient. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a complex of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with sulfonated azocalix[4]arene (HCQ@SAC4A) is prepared to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in a combined fashion. SAC4A is a therapeutic agent that exhibits scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. It is also a hypoxia&#8208;responsive carrier that can deliver HCQ directly to the inflammatory articular cavity. Consequently, HCQ@SAC4A achieves the synergistic anti&#8208;inflammatory effect on both inflamed RAW 264.7 cells and RA rats. This effect is attributed to the temporal and spatial consistency of the two active ingredients of the complex. As a new paradigm for combinational therapy, the drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug strategy advances in easy preparation, mix&#8208;and&#8208;match combination, and precise ratiometric control.

         <title>Controlled Formation of Conduction Channels in Memristive Devices Observed by X&#8208;ray Multimodal Imaging</title>

Abstract
Neuromorphic computing provides a means for achieving faster and more energy efficient computations than conventional digital computers for artificial intelligence (AI). However, its current accuracy is generally less than the dominant software&#8208;based AI. The key to improving accuracy is to reduce the intrinsic randomness of memristive devices, emulating synapses in the brain for neuromorphic computing. Here using a planar device as a model system, we achieve the controlled formation of conduction channels with high oxygen vacancy concentrations through the design of sharp protrusions in the electrode gap, as observed by X&#8208;ray multimodal imaging of both oxygen stoichiometry and crystallinity. Classical molecular dynamics simulations confirm that the controlled formation of conduction channels arises from confinement of the electric field, yielding a reproducible spatial distribution of oxygen vacancies across switching cycles. Our work demonstrates an effective route to control the otherwise random electroforming process by electrode design, facilitating the development of more accurate memristive devices for neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Ge Bidirectional Diffusion to Simultaneously Engineer Back Interface and Bulk Defects in the Absorber for Efficient CZTSSe Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge bidirectional diffusion, simultaneously toward the Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) absorber and MoSe2 at the back interface, is realized by an easy&#8208;handling method. The crystal growth of the absorbers is regulated and the work function of MoSe2 is enhanced as well. Up to 13.14% efficiency is achieved for Ge&#8208;involved CZTSSe solar cells, which present a certified efficiency of 12.8%.








Abstract
Aiming at a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit in Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 (CZTSSe) solar cells, a new and effective strategy to simultaneously regulate the back interface and restrain bulk defects of CZTSSe absorbers is developed by directly introducing a thin GeO2 layer on Mo substrates. Power conversion efficiency (power&#8208;to&#8208;efficiency) as high as 13.14% with a VOC of 547&#160;mV is achieved for the champion device, which presents a certified efficiency of 12.8% (aperture area: 0.25667 cm2). Further investigation reveals that Ge bidirectional diffusion simultaneously occurs toward the CZTSSe absorber and MoSe2 layer at the back interface while being selenized. That is, some Ge element from the GeO2 diffuses into the CZTSSe absorber layer to afford Ge&#8208;doped absorbers, which can significantly reduce the defect density and band tailing, and facilitate quasi&#8208;Fermi level split by relatively higher hole concentration. Meanwhile, a small amount of Ge element also participates in the formation of MoSe2 at the back interface, thus enhancing the work function of MoSe2 and effectively separating photoinduced carriers. This work highlights the synergistic effect of Ge element toward the bulk absorber and the back interface and also provides an easy&#8208;handling way to achieve high&#8208;performance CZTSSe solar cells.

         <title>Engineered Exosomes with Independent Module/Cascading Function for Therapy of Parkinson's Disease by Multistep Targeting and Multistage Intervention Method</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform is proposed. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.








Abstract
Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment&#8208;damaged cells&#8208;diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.

The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis ability is controllably combined with a natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode by using a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method, which realizes the &#8220;cascading function&#8221; for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Current exosome engineering methods usually lead to the damage of exosome morphology and membrane, which cannot meet the complex needs of disease treatment. Herein, the concept of an &#8220;independent module/cascading function&#8221; is proposed to construct an engineered exosome nanotherapy platform including an independent artificial module and a natural module. The artificial module with movement/chemotaxis function is first synthesized, and then it is controllably combined with the natural exosome module with &#8220;one by one&#8221; mode through a &#8220;differentiated&#8221; modification method. The whole process can not only maintain the activity of the natural exosome module, but also endows it with motion ability, so as to realize the purpose of &#8220;cascading function&#8221; in the process of disease treatment. The above engineered exosomes are used in the treatment of Parkinson's disease (PD). Moreover, the multistep targeting strategy of &#8220;disease microenvironment-damaged cells-diseased mitochondria&#8221; and the multistage intervention concept of &#8220;inhibiting deterioration and promoting repair&#8221; are proposed, so as to break through the bottleneck of the existing treatment of PD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Promoting Ex&#8208;Solution from Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Mediated Oxide Scaffolds for Highly Active and Robust Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ex&#8208;solution process is reconceptualized with the design of the host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor. Owing to the structural advantages of the MOF, higher levels of doping and more uniform ex&#8208;solution are enabled. These ex&#8208;solved materials attain a record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.








Abstract
Ex&#8208;solution catalysts, in which a host oxide is decorated with confined metallic nanoparticles, have exhibited breakthrough activity in various catalytic reactions. However, catalysts prepared by conventional ex&#8208;solution processes are limited by the low surface area of host oxides, the limited solubility of dopants, and the incomplete conversion of doped cations into metal catalysts. Here, the design of the host oxide structure is reconceptualized using a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) as an oxide precursor that can absorb a large quantity of ions while also promoting ex&#8208;solution at low temperatures (400&#8211;500&#160;&#176;C). The MOF&#8208;derived metal oxide host can readily incorporate metal cations, from which catalytic nanoparticles can be uniformly ex&#8208;solved owing to the short diffusion length in the nano&#8208;sized oxides. The distinct ex&#8208;solution behaviors of Pt, Pd, and Rh, and their bimetallic combinations are investigated. The MOF&#8208;driven mesoporous ZnO particles functionalized with PdPt catalysts ex&#8208;solved at 500&#160;&#176;C show benchmark&#8208;level of acetone oxidation activity as well as acetone&#8208;sensing characteristics by accelerating both oxygen chemisorption and acetone dissociation. Their findings provide a new route for the preparation of highly active catalysts by engineering the architecture and composition of the host oxide to facilitate the ex&#8208;solution process rationally.

         <title>How Reproducible are Surface Areas Calculated from the BET Equation?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A round&#8208;robin study involving 61 labs is performed, and it is shown that the determination of Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) areas from identical isotherms is a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI) is presented, which expands on the Rouquerol criteria, and which makes an unambiguous BET area calculation possible.








Abstract
Porosity and surface area analysis play a prominent role in modern materials science. At the heart of this sits the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) theory, which has been a remarkably successful contribution to the field of materials science. The BET method was&#160;developed in the 1930s for open surfaces but is now the most widely used metric for the estimation of surface areas of micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials. Despite its widespread use, the calculation of BET surface areas causes a spread in reported areas, resulting in reproducibility problems in both academia and industry. To prove this, for this analysis, 18 already&#8208;measured raw adsorption isotherms were&#160;provided to sixty&#8208;one labs, who were&#160;asked to calculate the corresponding BET areas. This round&#8208;robin exercise resulted in a wide range of values. Here, the reproducibility of BET area determination from identical isotherms is demonstrated to be a largely ignored issue, raising critical concerns over the reliability of reported BET areas. To solve this major issue, a new computational approach to accurately and systematically determine the BET area of nanoporous materials is developed. The software, called &#8220;BET surface identification&#8221; (BETSI), expands on the well&#8208;known Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible.

         <title>A Protein&#8208;Like Nanogel for Spinning Hierarchically Structured Artificial Spider Silk</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fiber is draw&#8208;spun from a soluble and crosslinked nanogel, and exhibits spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds, prestretch, and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27 GPa) and toughness (383 MJ m&#8722;3).








Abstract
Spider dragline silk is draw&#8208;spun from soluble, &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;crosslinked spidroin in aqueous solution. This spider silk has an excellent combination of strength and toughness, which originates from the hierarchical structure containing &#946;&#8208;sheet crosslinking points, spiral nanoassemblies, a rigid sheath, and a soft core. Inspired by the spidroin structure and spider spinning process, a soluble and crosslinked nanogel is prepared and crosslinked fibers are drew spun with spider&#8208;silk&#8208;like hierarchical structures containing cross&#8208;links, aligned nanoassemblies, and sheath&#8211;core structures. Introducing nucleation seeds in the nanogel solution, and applying prestretch and a spiral architecture in the nanogel fiber, further tunes the alignment and assembly of the polymer chains, and enhances the breaking strength (1.27&#160;GPa) and toughness (383&#160;MJ m&#8722;3) to approach those of the best dragline silk. Theoretical modeling provides understanding for the dependence of the fiber's spinning capacity on the nanogel size. This work provides a new strategy for the direct spinning of tough fiber materials.

         <title>Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8211;Shaw Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Capillary suction is a phenomenon in which surface tension spontaneously drives flow into confined geometries. This physics is leveraged to demonstrate a method for the passive assembly of soft materials using templated Hele&#8211;Shaw cells. These pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized patterns and material properties.








Abstract
Natural materials are highly organized, frequently possessing intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here, a new frugal methodology is reported to fabricate pixelated soft materials. This approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary&#8208;mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries.

     alt="Formation of Pixelated Elastic Films via Capillary Suction of Curable Elastomers in Templated Hele&#8211;Shaw Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Capillary suction is a phenomenon in which surface tension spontaneously drives flow into confined geometries. This physics is leveraged to demonstrate a method for the passive assembly of soft materials using templated Hele&#8211;Shaw cells. These pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized patterns and material properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural materials are highly organized, frequently possessing intricate and sophisticated hierarchical structures from which superior properties emerge. In the wake of biomimicry, there is a growing interest in designing architected materials in the laboratory as such structures could enable myriad functionalities in engineering. Yet, their fabrication remains challenging despite recent progress in additive manufacturing. In particular, soft materials are typically poorly suited to form the requisite structures consisting of regular geometries. Here, a new frugal methodology is reported to fabricate pixelated soft materials. This approach is conceptually analogous to the watershed transform used in image analysis and allows the passive assembly of complex geometries through the capillary-mediated flow of curable elastomers in confined geometries. Emerging from sources distributed across a Hele&#8211;Shaw cell consisting of two parallel flat plates separated by an infinitesimally small gap, these flows eventually meet at the &#8220;dividing lines&#8221; thereby forming Voronoi tesselations. After curing is complete, these structures turn into composite elastic sheets. Rationalizing the fluid mechanics at play allows the structural geometry of the newly formed sheets to be tailored and thereby their local material&#160;properties to be tuned.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembled 3D Penetrating Nanonetwork for High&#8208;Performance Intrinsically Stretchable Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork tactic is developed based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN) to achieve increased stretchability and charge transportability simultaneously for blended emissive films. The obtained intrinsically stretchable polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes exhibit low turn&#8208;on voltage (6.5 V) and high luminescence (over 3780 cd m&#8211;2), simultaneously.








Abstract
The emergence of wearable technology can significantly benefit from electronic displays fabricated using intrinsically stretchable (is&#8208;) materials. Typically, an improvement in the stretchability of conventional light&#8208;emitting polymers is accompanied by a decrease in charge transportability, thus resulting in a significant decrease in device efficiency. In this study, a self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork is developed to achieve increased stretchability and mobility simultaneously, based on high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight phenylenevinylene (L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV) and polyacrylonitrile (PAN). The mobility of L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN increases by 5&#8211;6 times and the stretchability increases from 20% (pristine L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV film) to 100%. A high current efficiency (CE) of 8.13&#160;cd A&#8722;1 is observed in polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) fabricated using 40% stretched L&#8208;SY&#8208;PPV/PAN. Furthermore, using a polyethyleneimine ethoxylated (PEIE), an 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline monohydrate (pBphen), and a reduced Triton X&#8208;100 (TR) chelated Zn&#8208;based is&#8208; electron&#8208;injection layer of Zn&#8208;PEIE&#8208;pBphen&#8208;TR, an is&#8208;PLED is realized with a turn&#8208;on voltage of 6.5&#160;V and a high CE of 2.35&#160;cd A&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of using the self&#8208;assembled 3D penetrating nanonetwork for the fabrication of is&#8208;PLEDs.

         <title>A Unique Fe&#8211;N4 Coordination System Enabling Transformation of Oxygen into Superoxide for Photocatalytic C&#63743;H Activation with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. In this work, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride, that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated.








Abstract
Selective oxidation of C&#63743;H bonds is one of the most important reactions in organic synthesis. However, activation of the &#945;&#8208;C&#63743;H bond of ethylbenzene by use of photocatalysis&#8208;generated superoxide anions (O2&#8226;&#8722;) remains a challenge. Herein, the formation of individual Fe atoms on polymeric carbon nitride (CN), that activates O2&#160;to create O2&#8226;&#8722; for facilitating the reaction of ethylbenzene to form acetophenone, is demonstrated. By utilizing density functional theory and materials characterization techniques, it is shown that individual Fe atoms are coordinated to four N atoms of CN and the resultant low&#8208;spin Fe&#8211;N4&#160;system (t2g6eg0) is not only a great adsorption site for oxygen molecules, but also allows for fast transfer of electrons generated in the CN framework to adsorbed O2, producing O2&#8226;&#8722;. The oxidation reaction of ethylbenzene triggered by O2&#8226;&#8722; ions turns out to have a high conversion rate of 99% as well as an acetophenone selectivity of 99%, which can be ascribed to a novel reaction pathway that is different from the conventional route involving hydroxyl radicals and the production of phenethyl alcohol. Furthermore, it possesses great potential for other C&#63743;H activation reactions besides ethylbenzene oxidation.

         <title>Magnetic Anisotropy Control with Curie Temperature above 400 K in a van der Waals Ferromagnet for Spintronic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic phase control is the source of fascinating correlated phenomena and the frontier research direction in materials science and spintronic devices. Magnetic anisotropy control and a dramatically enhanced Tc up to 400 K are realized in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 during a high&#8208;pressure loading&#8211;deloading process, shedding light on exploring the exchange interaction mechanism and realizing practical spintronic applications.








Abstract
The technological appeal of van der Waals ferromagnetic materials is the ability to control magnetism under external fields with desired thickness toward novel spintronic applications. For practically useful devices, ferromagnetism above room temperature or tunable magnetic anisotropy is highly demanded but remains challenging. To date, only a few layered materials exhibit unambiguous ferromagnetic ordering at room temperature via gating techniques or interface engineering. Here, it is demonstrated that the magnetic anisotropy control and dramatic modulation of Curie temperature (Tc) up to 400 K are realized in layered Fe5GeTe2 via the high&#8208;pressure diamond&#8208;anvil&#8208;cell technique. Magnetic phases manifesting with in&#8208;plane anisotropic, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane anisotropic and nearly isotropic magnetic states can be tuned in a controllable way, depicted by the phase diagram with a maximum Tc up to 360 K. Remarkably, the Tc can be gradually enhanced to above 400 K owing to the Fermi surface evolution during a pressure loading&#8211;deloading process. Such an observation sheds light on the understanding and control of emergent magnetic states in practical spintronic applications.

         <title>More Powerful Twistron Carbon Nanotube Yarn Mechanical Energy Harvesters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7&#8208;fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12&#8208;fold those reported for previous materials&#8208;based technologies for key frequency ranges.








Abstract
Stretching a coiled carbon nanotube (CNT) yarn can provide large, reversible electrochemical capacitance changes, which convert mechanical energy to electricity. Here, it is shown that the performance of these &#8220;twistron&#8221; harvesters can be increased by optimizing the alignment of precursor CNT forests, plastically stretching the precursor twisted yarn, applying much higher tensile loads during precoiling twist than for coiling, using electrothermal pulse annealing under tension, and incorporating reduced graphene oxide nanoplates. The peak output power for a 1 and a 30&#160;Hz sinusoidal deformation are 0.73 and 3.19&#160;kW&#160;kg&#8722;1, respectively, which are 24&#8208; and 13&#8208;fold that of previous twistron harvesters at these respective frequencies. This performance at 30&#160;Hz is over 12&#8208;fold that of other prior&#8208;art mechanical energy harvesters for frequencies between 0.1 and 600&#160;Hz. The maximum energy conversion efficiency is 7.2&#8208;fold that for previous twistrons. Twistron anode and cathode yarn arrays are stretched 180&#176; out&#8208;of&#8208;phase by locating them in the negative and positive compressibility directions of hinged wine&#8208;rack frames, thereby doubling the output voltage and reducing the input mechanical energy.

&lt;p&gt;More powerful twistron carbon nanotube yarn mechanical energy harvesters are achieved by mechanically and thermally modifying the fundamental structure of twistrons and by incorporating graphene sheets within twistrons. The energy conversion efficiency of the twistrons can be increased over 7-fold and the peak power output can reach values that are 12-fold those reported for previous materials-based technologies for key frequency ranges.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Hole Germanium Quantum Well on Silicon</title>

Silicon&#8208;integrated light&#8208;hole quantum wells: a versatile platform toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processor is reported.








Abstract
The quiet quantum environment of holes in solid&#8208;state devices is at the core of increasingly reliable architectures for quantum processors and memories. However, due to the lack of scalable materials to properly tailor the valence band character and its energy offsets, the precise engineering of light&#8208;hole (LH) states remains a serious obstacle toward coherent optical photon&#8211;spin interfaces needed for a direct mapping of the quantum information encoded in photon flying qubits to stationary spin processors. Herein, to alleviate this long&#8208;standing limitation, an all&#8208;group&#8208;IV low&#8208;dimensional system is demonstrated, consisting of a highly tensile strained germanium quantum well grown on silicon allowing new degrees of freedom to control and manipulate the hole states. Wafer&#8208;level, high bi&#8208;isotropic in&#8208;plane tensile strain (&lt;1%) is achieved using strain&#8208;engineered, metastable germanium&#8211;tin alloyed buffer layers yielding quantum wells with LH ground state, high g&#8208;factor anisotropy, and a tunable splitting of the hole sub&#8208;bands. The epitaxial heterostructures display sharp interfaces with sub&#8208;nanometer broadening and show room&#8208;temperature excitonic transitions that are modulated and extended to the mid&#8208;wave infrared by controlling strain and thickness. This ability to engineer quantum structures with LH selective confinement and controllable optical response enables manufacturable silicon&#8208;compatible platforms relevant to integrated quantum communication and sensing technologies.

         <title>Engineering DNA&#8208;Guided Hydroxyapatite Bulk Materials with High Stiffness and Outstanding Antimicrobial Ability for Dental Inlay Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrastiff DNA&#8211;hydroxyapatite bulk composites are fabricated by in situ mineralization in a long&#8208;range ordered DNA scaffold. The as&#8208;prepared composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus and a long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial behavior. A new type of artificial dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial ability is thus developed for dental restoration applications.








Abstract
Programmable base pair interactions at the nanoscale make DNA an attractive scaffold for forming hydroxyapatite (HAP) nanostructures. However, engineering macroscale HAP mineralization guided by DNA molecules remains challenging. To overcome this issue, a facile strategy is developed for the fabrication of ultrastiff DNA&#8211;HAP bulk composites. The electrostatic complexation of DNA and a surfactant with a quaternary ammonium salt group enables the formation of long&#8208;range ordered scaffolds using electrospinning. The growth of 1D and 2D HAP minerals is thus realized by this DNA template at a macroscale. Remarkably, the as&#8208;prepared DNA&#8211;HAP composites exhibit an ultrahigh Young's modulus of &#8776;25&#160;GPa, which is comparable to natural HAP and superior to most artificial mineralized composites. Furthermore, a&#160;new type of dental inlay with outstanding antibacterial properties is developed using the stiff DNA&#8211;HAP. The encapsulated quaternary ammonium group within the dense HAP endows the composite with long&#8208;lasting and local antibacterial activity. Therefore, this new type of super&#8208;stiff biomaterial holds great potential for oral prosthetic applications.

         <title>Local Coordination Regulation through Tuning Atomic&#8208;Scale Cavities of Pd Metallene toward Efficient Oxygen Reduction Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale cavities of ultrathin (111)&#8208;exposed Pd metallene, which can increase coordination number and result in moderate downshifting of the d&#8208;band center, are proposed as a new active site for boosting oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Moderate adsorption of oxygenated intermediates takes a significant role in rational design of high&#8208;efficiency oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) electrocatalysts. Long&#8208;serving as a reliable strategy to tune geometric structure of nanomaterials, defect engineering enjoys the great ability of adjusting the coordination environment of catalytic active sites, which enables dominant regulation of adsorption energy and kinetics of ORR catalysis. However, limited to controllable nanocrystals fabrication, inducing uniformly dispersed high&#8208;coordinated defects into ultrathin 2D nanosheets remains challenging. Herein, atomic&#8208;scale cavities (ASCs) are proposed as a new kind of high&#8208;coordinated active site and successfully introduced into suprathin Pd (111)&#8208;exposed metallene. Due to its atomic concave architecture, leading to elevated CN and moderately downshifted d&#8208;band center, the as&#8208;made Pd metallene with ASCs (c&#8208;Pd M) exhibits excellent ORR performance with mass activity of 2.76 A mgPd&#8722;1 at 0.9&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) and half&#8208;wave potential as high as 0.947&#160;V, which is 18.9 (2.7) times higher and 104 (46) mV larger than that of commercial Pt/C (Pd metallene without ASCs). Besides, the durability of c&#8208;Pd M exceeds its commercial counterpart with &#8776;30% loss after 5000 cycles. This work highlights a new&#8208;style mentality of designing fancy active sites toward efficient ORR electrocatalysis.

         <title>Activated Ni&#8211;OH Bonds in a Catalyst Facilitates the Nucleophile Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is a complex reaction including electrochemical step and spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process. The interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects of Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS enable the activated Ni2+&#8211;OH to exhibit an excellent NOR activity. More importantly, spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps, including proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer, hydration, and rearrangement, lead to diverse nucleophile dehydrogenation oxidation pathways of different NOR systems.








Abstract
The nucleophile oxidation reaction (NOR) is of enormous significance for organic electrosynthesis and coupling for hydrogen generation. However, the nonuniform NOR mechanism limits its development. For the NOR, involving electrocatalysis and organic chemistry, both the electrochemical step and non&#8208;electrochemical process should be taken into account. The NOR of nickel&#8208;based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni2+&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space&#8208;confinement&#8208;induced synthesis of Ni3Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single&#8208;atom&#8208;layer Pt nanosheets (Ni3Fe LDH&#8208;Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non&#8208;electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni3+&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni2+&#8211;OH + X&#8226;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.

The NOR of nickel-based hydroxides includes the electrogenerated dehydrogenation of the Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;OH bond and a spontaneous non-electrochemical process; the former determines the electrochemical activity, and the nucleophile oxidation pathway depends on the latter. Herein, the space-confinement-induced synthesis of Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe layered double hydroxide intercalated with single-atom-layer Pt nanosheets (Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe LDH-Pt NS) is reported. The synergy of interlayer Pt nanosheets and multiple defects activates Ni&#8211;OH bonds, thus exhibiting an excellent NOR performance. The spontaneous non-electrochemical steps of the NOR are revealed, such as proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET; Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;O + X&#8211;H = Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;OH + X&lt;sup&gt;&#8226;&lt;/sup&gt;), hydration, and rearrangement. Hence, the reaction pathway of the NOR is deciphered, which not only helps to perfect the NOR mechanism, but also provides inspiration for organic electrosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Integration of a Zinc Metasilicate Interface Layer Guiding Well&#8208;Regulated Zn Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemistry strategy with industrial operability is developed to realize large&#8208;scale integration of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O nanosheet arrays on Zn foil. Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location electron microscopy characterization is designed to visualize and uncover the in situ integration mechanism of Zn&#8211;Si&#8211;O layer. The life spans of symmetric cells, and full cells coupled with high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading cathode, have increased by 3&#8211;7 times.








Abstract
Uneven distribution of electric fields at the electrolyte&#8211;anode interface and associated Zn dendrite growth is one of the most critical barriers that limit the life span of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, new&#8208;type Zn&#8211;A&#8211;O (A = Si, Ti) interface layers with thin and uniform thickness, porosity, and hydrophilicity properties are developed to realize homogeneous and smooth Zn plating. For ZnSiO3 nanosheet arrays on Zn foil (Zn@ZSO), their formation follows an &#8220;etching&#8211;nucleation&#8211;growth&#8221; mechanism that is confirmed by a well&#8208;designed Zn&#8208;island&#8208;based identical&#8208;location microscopy method, the geometric area of which is up to 1000 cm2 in one&#8208;pot synthesis based on a low&#8208;temperature wet&#8208;chemical method. Guided by the structural advantages of the ZSO layer, the Zn2+ flux gets equalized. Besides ultralow polarization, the life spans of symmetric cells and full cells coupled with a high&#8208;mass&#8208;loading K0.27MnO2&#183;0.54H2O (8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) cathode, are increased by 3&#8211;7 times with the Zn@ZSO anode. Moreover, the large&#8208;scale preparation of Zn@ZSO foil contributes to a 0.5 Ah multilayer pouch cell with high performance, further confirming its prospects for practical application.

         <title>Boosting H2 Production from a BiVO4 Photoelectrochemical Biomass Fuel Cell by the Construction of a Bridge for Charge and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique BiVO4 photoelectrochemical fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost tartaric acid biomass as an organic fuel. The strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid provides a bridge for charge and energy transfer. The optimal BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a remarkable current density of 13.54 mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode under AM1.5G.








Abstract
Utilizing a photoelectrochemical (PEC) fuel cell to replace difficult water oxidation with facile oxidation of organic wastes is regarded as an effective method to improve the H2 production efficiency. However, in most reported PEC fuel cells, their PEC activities are still low and the energy in organic fuels cannot be effectively utilized. Here, a unique BiVO4 PEC fuel cell is successfully developed by utilizing the low&#8208;cost biomass, tartaric acid, as an organic fuel. Thanks to the strong complexation between BiVO4 and tartaric acid, a bridge for the charge and energy transfer is successfully constructed, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency of BiVO4, but also effectively converts the chemical energy of biomass into H2. Remarkably, under AM1.5G illumination, the optimal nanoporous BiVO4 photoanode exhibits a high current density of 13.54&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) for H2 production, which is higher than that of previously reported PEC water splitting systems or PEC fuel cell systems. This work opens a new path for solving the low PEC H2 production efficiency and provides a new idea for improving the performances and energy conversion efficiency in traditional PEC fuel cells.

The bandgap of Cs0.22FA0.78Pb (I0.85Br0.15)3 is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding 3 mol% CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters. Adding extra 2 mol% CsCl can enrich Cl at the NiOx/perovskite interface, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface and improving the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. This enables efficient p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCE up to 27.26%.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is an attractive hole&#8208;transport material for efficient and stable p&#8211;i&#8211;n metal&#8208;halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, an undesirable redox reaction occurs at the NiOx/perovskite interface, which results in a low open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC), instability, and phase separation of the NiOx&#8208;based wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (Br &gt; 20%). In order to simultaneously address the abovementioned phase separation problem and redox chemistry at the perovskite/NiOx interface, the bandgap is widened from 1.64 to 1.67 eV by adding inorganic CsPbCl3&#8208;clusters (3 mol%) to the Cs22Br15 perovskite precursor solution. Moreover, adding extra 2 mol% CsCl enriches the NiOx/perovskite interface with Cl, thereby preventing the redox reaction at the interface, while controlling the Br content to within 15% improves the photostability of the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of a single&#8208;junction p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSC increases from 17.82% to 19.76%, which leads to the fabrication of highly efficient monolithic p&#8211;i&#8211;n&#8208;type NiOx&#8208;based perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with PCEs of up to 27.26% (certified PCE: 27.15%). The perovskite to an n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;type perovskite/silicon tandem solar cell is also applied to deliver a VOC of 1.93 V and a final efficiency of 25.5%. These findings provide critical insight into the fabrication of highly efficient and stable wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites.

A direct deep ultraviolet (DUV) photolithography method, which enables fabrication of microstructures in bulk polystyrene cell culture substrates, is presented. Pipelines for generating ink&#8208;based DUV masks and micropattern virtualization further increase the remarkable straightforwardness of the process. This, combined with the high applicability, can significantly improve accessibility of this class of microfabrication techniques to a broad biological research community.








Abstract
Tissue&#8208;culture&#8208;ware polystyrene is the gold standard for in vitro cell culture. While microengineering techniques can create advanced cell microenvironments in polystyrene, they require specialized equipment and reagents, which hinder their accessibility for most biological researchers. An economical and easily accessible method is developed and validated for fabricating microstructures directly in polystyrene with sizes approaching subcellular dimensions while requiring minimal processing time. The process involves deep ultraviolet irradiation through a shadow mask or ink pattern using inexpensive, handheld devices followed by selective chemical development with common reagents to generate micropatterns with depths/heights between 5 and 10&#160;&#181;m, which can be used to guide cell behavior. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

         <title>Tailoring Ultrafast and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage via Binding&#8208;Energy&#8208;Driven Atomic Scissors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge metal with remarkable alloying ability is utilized as novel chemical scissors to controllably reconstruct Ge&#63743;S bonds in the sulfide matrix to fabricate a new GeTiS3 compound. The integrated alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution enable high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium storage.








Abstract
Controllably tailoring alloying anode materials to achieve fast charging and enhanced structural stability is crucial for sodium&#8208;ion batteries with high rate and high capacity performance, yet remains a significant challenge owing to the huge volume change and sluggish sodiation kinetics. Here, a chemical tailoring tool is proposed and developed by atomically dispersing high&#8208;capacity Ge metal into the rigid and conductive sulfide framework for controllable reconstruction of Ge&#63743;S bonds to synergistically realize high capacity and high rate performance for sodium storage. The integrated GeTiS3 material with stable Ti&#8211;S framework and weak Ge&#63743;S bonding delivers high specific capacities of 678 mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.3 C over 100 cycles and 209 mA h g&#8722;1 at 32 C over 10&#160;000 cycles, outperforming most of the reported alloying type anode materials for sodium storage. Interestingly, in situ Raman, X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD), and ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterizations reveal the formation of well&#8208;dispersed NaxGe confined in the rigid Ti&#8211;S matrix with suppressed volume change after discharge. The synergistically coupled alloying&#8208;conversion and surface&#8208;dominated redox reactions with enhanced capacitive contribution and high reaction reversibility by a binding&#8208;energy&#8208;driven atomic scissors method would break new ground on designing a high&#8208;rate and high&#8208;capacity sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Boosting Electrochemical Styrene Transformation via Tandem Water Oxidation over a Single&#8208;Atom Cr1/CoSe2 Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tandem oxidation strategy based on a Co&#8211;Cr cooperated single&#8208;atom Cr1/CoSe2 electrocatalyst is presented, turning the competition between the oxygen evolution reaction and styrene oxidation into mutual benefits via the migration of the *OOH intermediate from the Co to the Cr site, achieving an efficient and mild selective oxidation of styrene without any exogenous oxidizing reagent.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of organics using water as the oxygen source is a prospective but challenging method to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals; especially, the competitive oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits its efficiency. Herein, a tandem catalysis strategy based on a single&#8208;atom catalyst with Cr atoms atomically dispersed at a CoSe2 support (Cr1/CoSe2) is presented. Thereinto, Co and Cr sites are endowed with a specific function to activate water and styrene respectively, and the competition between the OER and styrene oxidation is turned into mutual benefits via cooperated active sites. Under a potential of 1.6&#160;VAg/AgCl, excellent selectivity of 95% to benzaldehyde and a high conversion rate of styrene at 88% without any exogenous oxidizing reagent are achieved. Isotopic tracing, isotope&#8208;labeled in situ Raman spectra, and detailed theoretical calculation further reveal the tandem mechanism, showing that the transfer of *OOH intermediates from the Co to the Cr sites serves as a bridge to link the oxidation of water and styrene. This work develops a new strategy for the co&#8208;oxidation of multi&#8208;species based on tandem catalysis, providing novel insights for the design of single&#8208;atom catalysts.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Mid&#8208;Infrared Biosensing in Aqueous Solutions with Graphene Plasmons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ identification of biomolecules in aqueous solutions by IR spectroscopy is important for exploring biological processes. However, the strong and broad IR absorption of water overwhelms the vibrations of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable graphene plasmonic aqueous IR biosensor is exploited to directly probe a protein's vibrations and characterize the deuterium effects, which provides a platform for studying nanoscale biological processes.








Abstract
Identifying nanoscale biomolecules in aqueous solutions by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) provides an in situ and noninvasive method for exploring the structure, reactions, and transport of biologically active molecules. However, this remains a challenge due to the strong and broad IR absorption of water which overwhelms the respective vibrational fingerprints of the biomolecules. In this work, a tunable IR transparent microfluidic system with graphene plasmons is exploited to identify &#8776;2&#160;nm&#8208;thick proteins in physiological conditions. The acquired in situ tunability makes it possible to eliminate the IR absorption of water outside the graphene plasmonic hotspots by background subtraction. Most importantly, the ultrahigh confinement of graphene plasmons (confined to &#8776;15&#160;nm) permits the implementation of nanoscale sensitivity. Then, the deuterium effects on monolayer proteins are characterized within an aqueous solution. The tunable graphene&#8208;plasmon&#8208;enhanced FTIR technology provides a novel platform for studying biological processes in an aqueous solution at the nanoscale.

         <title>Submolecular Ligand Size and Spacing for Cell Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Submolecular tuning of ligand size and spacing is demonstrated via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles. It is revealed that submolecular ligand spacing stimulates integrin binding to facilitate the adhesion&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of macrophages. Increasing ligand spacing only significantly inhibits macrophage adhesion, whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly hinders macrophage adhesion.








Abstract
Cell adhesion occurs when integrin recognizes and binds to Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD) ligands present in fibronectin. In this work, submolecular ligand size and spacing are tuned via template&#8208;mediated in situ growth of nanoparticles for dynamic macrophage modulation. To tune liganded gold nanoparticle (GNP) size and spacing from 3 to 20&#160;nm, in situ localized assemblies of GNP arrays on nanomagnetite templates are engineered. 3&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands stimulate the binding of integrin, which mediates macrophage&#8208;adhesion&#8208;assisted pro&#8208;regenerative polarization as compared to 20&#160;nm&#8208;spaced ligands, which can be dynamically anchored to the substrate for stabilizing integrin binding and facilitating dynamic macrophage adhesion. Increasing the ligand size from 7 to 20&#160;nm only slightly promotes macrophage adhesion, not observed with 13&#160;nm&#8208;sized ligands. Increasing the ligand spacing from 3 to 17&#160;nm significantly hinders macrophage adhesion that induces inflammatory polarization. Submolecular tuning of ligand spacing can dominantly modulate host macrophages.

A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI)&#8208;resistant non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli&#8208;responsive block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles for targeted co&#8208;delivery of gefitinib and Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP)&#8208;siRNA. The nanosystem can block the EGFR signaling pathway with gefitinib, inhibit the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis by photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Yes&#8208;associated protein (YAP) has been identified as a key driver for epidermal growth factor receptor&#8208;tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR&#8208;TKI) resistance. Inhibition of YAP expression could be a potential therapeutic option for treating non&#8208;small&#8208;cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Herein, a nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed by employing amphiphilic and block&#8208;dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanoparticles (NPs) for targeted co&#8208;delivery of EGFR&#8208;TKI gefitinib (Gef) and YAP&#8208;siRNA to achieve a targeted drug/gene/photodynamic therapy. The resulting NPs are effectively internalized into Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC cells, successfully escape from late endosomes/lysosomes, and responsively release Gef and YAP&#8208;siRNA in an intracellular reductive environment. They preferentially accumulate at the tumor site after intravenous injection in both cell&#8208;line&#8208;derived xenograft (CDX) and patient&#8208;derived xenograft (PDX) models of Gef&#8208;resistant NSCLC, resulting in potent antitumor efficacy without distinct toxicity after laser irradiation. Mechanism studies reveal that the cocktail therapy could block the EGFR signaling pathway with Gef, inhibit activation of the EGFR bypass signaling pathway via YAP&#8208;siRNA, and induce tumor cell apoptosis through photodynamic therapy (PDT). Furthermore, this combination nanomedicine can sensitize PDT and impair glycolysis by downregulating HIF&#8208;1&#945;. These results suggest that this stimuli&#8208;responsive dendritic&#8208;polymer&#8208;based nanococktail therapy may provide a promising approach for the treatment of EGFR&#8208;TKI resistant NSCLC.

&lt;p&gt;A nanococktail therapeutic strategy is proposed to treat epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI)-resistant non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) by employing stimuli-responsive block-dendritic-polymer-based nanoparticles for targeted co-delivery of gefitinib and Yes-associated protein (YAP)-siRNA.

         <title>Prediction and Design of Nanozymes using Explainable Machine Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is a time&#8208;consuming, laborious, and resource&#8208;intensive task to control the catalytic activity of nanozymes. A data&#8208;driven approach that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms is trained on extracted data to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. This study offers a promising model to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity.








Abstract
An abundant number of nanomaterials have been discovered to possess enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, termed nanozymes. It is identified that a variety of internal and external factors influence the catalytic activity of nanozymes. However, there is a lack of essential methodologies to uncover the hidden mechanisms between nanozyme features and enzyme&#8208;like activity. Here, a data&#8208;driven approach is demonstrated that utilizes machine&#8208;learning algorithms to understand particle&#8211;property relationships, allowing for classification and quantitative predictions of enzyme&#8208;like activity exhibited by nanozymes. High consistency between predicted outputs and the observations is confirmed by accuracy (90.6%) and R2 (up to 0.80). Furthermore, sensitive analysis of the models reveals the central roles of transition metals in determining nanozyme activity. As an example, the models are successfully applied to predict or design desirable nanozymes by uncovering the hidden relationship between different periods of transition metals and their enzyme&#8208;like performance. This study offers a promising strategy to develop nanozymes with desirable catalytic activity and demonstrates the potential of machine learning within the field of material science.

         <title>Flexible and Tough Superelastic Co&#8211;Cr Alloys for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel developed Co&#8211;Cr&#8208;based biomaterial not only has a low Young's modulus (10&#8211;30 GPa) similar to human bone, but also a high wear resistance, disrupting the trade&#8208;off relation in conventional metallic biomaterials. The thermoelastic martensitic transformation of these alloys allows a huge recoverable superelastic strain up to 17.0%, which is twice that of commercial Ti&#8211;Ni.








Abstract
The demand for biomaterials has been increasing along with the increase in the population of elderly people worldwide. The mechanical properties and high wear resistance of metallic biomaterials make them well&#8208;suited for use as substitutes or as support for damaged hard tissues. However, unless these biomaterials also have a low Young's modulus similar to that of human bones, bone atrophy inevitably occurs. Because a low Young's modulus is typically associated with poor wear resistance, it is difficult to realize a low Young's modulus and high wear resistance simultaneously. Also, the superelastic property of shape&#8208;memory alloys makes them suitable for biomedical applications, like vascular stents and guide wires. However, due to the low recoverable strain of conventional biocompatible shape&#8208;memory alloys, the demand for a new alloy system is high. The novel body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys in this work provide a solution to both of these problems. The Young's modulus of &lt;001&gt;&#8208;oriented&#160;single&#8208;crystal cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys is 10&#8211;30 GPa, which is similar to that of human bone, and they also demonstrate high wear and corrosion resistance. They also exhibit superelasticity with a huge recoverable strain up to 17.0%. For these reasons, the novel cobalt&#8211;chromium&#8208;based alloys can be promising candidates for biomedical applications.

         <title>Site&#8208;Specific Electron&#8208;Driving Observations of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 Photoreduction on Co&#8208;Doped CeO2/Crystalline Carbon Nitride S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions</title>

         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;level regulation of S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions is designed by integrating Co&#8208;doped CeO2 nanoparticles with highly crystalline poly(triazine imide), of which the surface Co&#8208;embedded CeCo conjunction features functionalized Co species toward the boosted directional electron&#8208;driving effect from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, thus promoting electronic transferability for multiple electrons&#8208;involving CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction.








Abstract
Photoexcited dynamic modulation, maximizing the effective utilization of photoinduced electron&#8211;hole pairs, dominates the multiple electrons&#8208;involving reduction pathways for terminal CH4 evolution during CO2 photoreduction. Yet, the site&#8208;specific regulation of directional charge transfer by modification of an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction has seldom been discussed. Herein, an atomic&#8208;level tailoring strategy by anchoring single&#8208;atomic Co into CeO2 co&#8208;catalyst rather than carbon nitride supports, which can selectively favor CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 photoreduction, is reported. Through in situ dynamic tracking investigations, this study identifies that surface Co&#8208;embedded bimetallic CeCo conjunction is the key feature driving a strong interconnection of dynamical charge states through S&#8208;scheme heterojunctions. The Co&#8208;embedded modification into CeO2 co&#8208;catalysts is demonstrated to have a critical effect on directional charge control, accelerating the driving of electrons from the carbon nitride donations to site&#8208;specific Co hubs, which thereby promotes electronic transferability for electrons&#8208;involving CH4 formation. As a result, an unprecedented CH4 yield (181.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1) is obtained with a high turnover number (411.4) through a fully gas&#8211;solid reaction, demonstrating its potential toward targeted CH4 formation without adding any sacrificial agent.

         <title>Biaxially Strained MoS2 Nanoshells with Controllable Layers Boost Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of biaxial strain and layer numbers of MoS2 nanoshells on the electrocatalytic activity is investigated in detail. Calculations reveal the superiority of biaxial strain over uniaxial strain and identify the ideal Mo coordination and S vacancies for maximal catalytic activity.








Abstract
Strain in layered transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a type of effective approach to enhance the catalytic performance by activating their inert basal plane. However, compared with traditional uniaxial strain, the influence of biaxial strain and the TMD layer number on the local electronic configuration remains unexplored. Herein, via a new in situ self&#8208;vulcanization strategy, biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells in the form of a single&#8208;crystalline Ni3S2@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure are realized, where the MoS2 layer is precisely controlled between the 1 and 5 layers. In particular, an electrode with the bilayer MoS2 nanoshells shows a remarkable hydrogen evolution reaction activity with a small overpotential of 78.1&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8208;2, and negligible activity degradation after durability testing. Density functional theory calculations reveal the contribution of the optimized biaxial strain together with the induced sulfur vacancies and identify the origin of superior catalytic sites in these biaxially strained MoS2 nanoshells. This work highlights the importance of the atomic&#8208;scale layer number and multiaxial strain in unlocking the potential of 2D TMD electrocatalysts.

         <title>Active Ultrahigh&#8208;Q (0.2 &#215; 106) THz Topological Cavities on a Chip</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;loss terahertz (THz) silicon topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system that can actively route signals through sharp bends by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106 is shown. On&#8208;chip active tailoring is demonstrated of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation at extremely low power through complete suppression of the back reflection, essential for sixth generation (6G) communication with THz topological integrated photonic circuits.








Abstract
Rapid scaling of semiconductor devices has led to an increase in the number of processor cores and integrated functionalities onto a single chip to support the growing demands of high&#8208;speed and large&#8208;volume consumer electronics. To meet this burgeoning demand, an improved interconnect capacity in terms of bandwidth density and active tunability is required for enhanced throughput and energy efficiency. Low&#8208;loss terahertz silicon interconnects with larger bandwidth offer a solution for the existing inter&#8208;/intrachip bandwidth density and energy&#8208;efficiency bottleneck. Here, a low&#8208;loss terahertz topological interconnect&#8211;cavity system is presented that can actively route signals through sharp bends, by critically coupling to a topological cavity with an ultrahigh&#8208;quality (Q) factor of 0.2 &#215; 106. The topologically protected large Q factor cavity enables energy&#8208;efficient optical control showing 60&#160;dB modulation. Dynamic control is further demonstrated of the critical coupling between the topological interconnect&#8211;cavity for on&#8208;chip active tailoring of the cavity resonance linewidth, frequency, and modulation through complete suppression of the back reflection. The silicon topological cavity is complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible and highly desirable for hybrid electronic&#8211;photonic technologies for sixth (6G) generation terahertz communication devices. Ultrahigh&#8208;Q cavity also paves the path for designing ultrasensitive topological sensors, terahertz topological integrated circuits, and nonlinear topological photonic devices.

         <title>The Role of Long&#8208;Alkyl&#8208;Group Spacers in Glycolated Copolymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New molecular design rules are established to overcome the trade&#8208;off between electronic and ionic conduction in OECTs. The gDPP&#8208;TTVTT copolymer achieves the best operational stability and maximum transconductance of 61.9 S cm&#8722;1. The long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer prevents morphological and electrostatic disruptions to the conjugated backbone, maintaining high electronic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities, while increasing ion density for efficient and stable OECTs.








Abstract
Semiconducting polymers with oligoethylene glycol (OEG) sidechains have attracted strong research interest for organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) applications. However, key molecular design rules for high&#8208;performance OECTs via efficient mixed electronic/ionic charge transport are still unclear. In this work, new glycolated copolymers (gDPP&#8208;TTT and gDPP&#8208;TTVTT) with diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) acceptor and thiophene (T) and vinylene (V) thiophene&#8208;based donor units are synthesized and characterized for accumulation mode OECTs, where a long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group (C12) attached to the DPP unit acts as a spacer distancing the OEG groups from the polymer backbone. gDPP&#8208;TTVTT shows the highest OECT transconductance (61.9 S cm&#8211;1) and high operational stability, compared to gDPP&#8208;TTT and their alkylated counterparts. Surprisingly, gDPP&#8208;TTVTT also shows high electronic charge mobility in a field&#8208;effect transistor, suggesting efficient ion injection/diffusion without hindering its efficient electronic charge transport. The elongated donor unit (TTVTT) facilitates hole polaron formation to be more localized to the donor unit, leading to faster and easier polaron formation with less impact on polymer structure during OECT operation, as opposed to the TTT unit. This is supported by molecular dynamics simulation. These simultaneously high electronic and ionic charge&#8208;transport properties are achieved due to the long&#8208;alkyl&#8208;group spacer in amphipathic sidechains, providing an important molecular design rule for glycolated copolymers.

         <title>Visualizing Atomically Layered Magnetism in CrSBr</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CrSBr is a layered material possessing intralayer ferromagnetic and interlayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering at low temperatures (T&#160;&lt;&#160;132&#160;K). At higher temperatures or in the presence of modest magnetic fields, AFM correlations are suppressed, yielding a magnetic phase with a comparatively high sheet susceptibility (&#967;2D). Magnetic force microscopy is sensitive to &#967;2D and identifies local nanoscale magnetic ordering.








Abstract
2D materials can host long&#8208;range magnetic order in the presence of underlying magnetic anisotropy. The ability to realize the full potential of 2D magnets necessitates systematic investigation of the role of individual atomic layers and nanoscale inhomogeneity (i.e., strain) on the emergence of stable magnetic phases. Here, spatially dependent magnetism in few&#8208;layer CrSBr is revealed using magnetic force microscopy (MFM) and Monte Carlo&#8208;based simulations. Nanoscale visualization of the magnetic sheet susceptibility is extracted from MFM data and force&#8211;distance curves, revealing a characteristic onset of both intra&#8208; and interlayer magnetic correlations as a function of temperature and layer&#8208;thickness. These results demonstrate that the presence of a single uncompensated layer in odd&#8208;layer terraces significantly reduces the stability of the low&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) phase and gives rise to multiple coexisting magnetic ground states at temperatures close to the bulk N&#233;el temperature (TN). Furthermore, the AFM phase can be reliably suppressed using modest fields (&#8776;16 mT) from the MFM probe, behaving as a nanoscale magnetic switch. This prototypical study of few&#8208;layer CrSBr demonstrates the critical role of layer parity on field&#8208;tunable 2D magnetism and validates MFM for use in nanomagnetometry of 2D materials (despite the ubiquitous absence of bulk zero&#8208;field magnetism in magnetized sheets).

         <title>Enabling 100C Fast&#8208;Charging Bulk Bi Anodes for Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the difficulty in simultaneously achieving a large capacity, ultrafast charging capability, and long cycling stability in a battery anode, a bulk Bi anode is presented for Na&#8208;ion batteries that provides a simple yet practical route&#160;to address this issue without using expensive nanoscale materials and additional complex modifications.








Abstract
It is challenging to develop alloying anodes with ultrafast charging and large energy storage using bulk anode materials because of the difficulty of carrier&#8208;ion diffusion and fragmentation of the active electrode material. Herein, a rational strategy is reported to design bulk Bi anodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries that feature ultrafast charging, long cyclability, and large energy storage without using expensive nanomaterials and surface modifications. It is found that bulk Bi particles gradually transform into a porous nanostructure during cycling in a glyme&#8208;based electrolyte, whereas the resultant structure stores Na ions by forming phases with high Na diffusivity. These features allow the anodes to exhibit unprecedented electrochemical properties; the developed Na&#8211;Bi half&#8208;cell delivers 379&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 (97% of that measured at 1C) at 7.7&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 (20C) during 3500 cycles. It also retained 94% and 93% of the capacity measured at 1C even at extremely fast&#8208;charging rates of 80C and 100C, respectively. The structural origins of the measured properties are verified by experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. The findings of this study not only broaden understanding of the underlying mechanisms of fast&#8208;charging anodes, but also provide basic guidelines for searching battery anodes that simultaneously exhibit high capacities, fast kinetics, and long cycling stabilities.

         <title>Dual Self&#8208;Built Gating Boosts the Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A design strategy, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221; is reported to boost the hydrogen evolution reaction. Taking ReS2 and WS2 as an example, dual self&#8208;built gating induces electrons from WS2 to ReS2 directionally. The tailored electronic structure can balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically, thus greatly promoting the intrinsic activity of the active sites.








Abstract
Optimizing the intrinsic activity of active sites is an appealing strategy for accelerating the kinetics of the catalytic process. Here, a design principle, namely &#8220;dual self&#8208;built gating&#8221;, is proposed to tailor the electronic structures of catalysts. Catalytic improvement is confirmed in a model catalyst with a ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 hybridized heterostructure. As demonstrated in experimental and theoretical results, the dual gating can bidirectionally guide electron transfer and redistribute at the interface, endowing the model catalyst with an electron&#8208;rich region. The tailored electronic structures balance the adsorption of intermediates and the desorption of hydrogen synergistically to enhance the reaction kinetics for the hydrogen evolution reaction. Interestingly, the effect of dual gating can be easily amplified by the electric field. The overpotential and Tafel slope (49&#160;mV, 35&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) obtained under the electric field for ReS2&#8211;WS2/WS2 catalyst with the dual self&#8208;built gating effect are far below than those (210&#160;mV, 116&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) of the pure WS2 catalyst, which exhibits nearly four times improvement. The concept of dual gating can be applied to more systems, offering a new guideline for designing advanced electrocatalysts.

         <title>Engineered Nanoerythrocytes Alleviate Central Nervous System Inflammation by Regulating the Polarization of Inflammatory Microglia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microglia are the main regulator of inflammatory response in ischemic stroke and multiple sclerosis. An engineered nanoerythrocyte immunosuppressive platform is developed for precise targeting and efficient reprogramming of M1 microglia. The regulation of microglia function, protection of the blood&#8211;brain barrier, and neurons are realized through upregulation of heme oxygenase&#8208;1 and reinforcement by intrinsic metabolism to generate anti&#8208;inflammatory substances CO and bilirubin.








Abstract
Microglial polarization is one of the most promising therapeutic strategies for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, safe, effective, and controllable microglial regulation still faces formidable challenges. Although some anti&#8208;inflammatory factors promote microglia polarization, their short half&#8208;life, high cost, unpredictable in vivo behavior, and complex delivery operations, hamper their clinical application. Here, inspired by the natural microhemorrhage cleaning mechanism, an MG1 peptide and RVG29 peptide engineered nanoerythrocyte (NEMR) that can reprogram microglia are developed from classical M1 toward alternative M2 by inducing heme oxygenase&#8208;1 (HO&#8208;1), stimulating Notch1/Hes1/Stat3 signaling, and further inhibiting NF&#8208;&#954;B p65 translocation. Moreover, anti&#8208;inflammatory carbon monoxide (CO) and bilirubin produced by endogenous metabolism of heme further reinforces the anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. In middle cerebral artery occlusion and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis models, a satisfactory prognosis is achieved, with precise regulation of inflammatory microglia in lesion sites, increased expression of anti&#8208;inflammatory factors, reduced blood&#8211;brain barrier permeability, as well as promotion of neurogenesis and functional recovery. Furthermore, NEMR can be integrated with clinical therapeutic agents, which facilitates precise drug delivery to enhance therapeutic effects. Hence, the natural nanoerythrocytes, as a feasible, efficient, safe, and practical tool, provides a new strategy for rebalancing of the immune environment in the CNS disorders.

         <title>Unraveling Thermodynamic and Kinetic Contributions to the Stability of Doped Nanocrystalline Alloys using Nanometallic Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Guided by modeling informed selection of the Mo&#8211;Au system, evolving grain boundary segregation behavior is explored through in situ electron microscopy thermal aging experiments on nanometallic multilayers. Isolation of the underlying stability mechanisms is accomplished by mapping the Au distribution with temperature, which, through comparison with thermodynamic predictions, collectively demonstrates the segregation states responsible for temperature&#8208;dependent stability transitions.








Abstract
Targeted doping of grain boundaries is widely pursued as a pathway for combating thermal instabilities in nanocrystalline metals. However, certain dopants predicted to produce grain&#8208;boundary&#8208;segregated nanocrystalline configurations instead form small nanoprecipitates at elevated temperatures that act to kinetically inhibit grain growth. Here, thermodynamic modeling is implemented to select the Mo&#8211;Au system for exploring the interplay between thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to nanostructure stability. Using nanoscale multilayers and in situ transmission electron microscopy thermal aging, evolving segregation states and the corresponding phase transitions are mapped with temperature. The microstructure is shown to evolve through a transformation at lower homologous temperatures (&lt;600&#160;&#176;C) where solute atoms cluster and segregate to the grain boundaries, consistent with predictions from thermodynamic models. An increase in temperature to 800&#160;&#176;C is accompanied by coarsening of the grain structure via grain boundary migration but with multiple pinning events uncovered between migrating segments of the grain boundary and local solute clustering. Direct comparison between the thermodynamic predictions and experimental observations of microstructure evolution thus demonstrates a transition from thermodynamically preferred to kinetically inhibited nanocrystalline stability and provides a general framework for decoupling contributions to complex stability transitions while simultaneously targeting a dominant thermal stability regime.

The polyanions in the hydrogel framework facilitate a homogeneous zinc&#8208;ion flux, and the Zn&#8211;O bonding strengthens the interface and suppresses surface corrosion and irregular Zn dendrites growth. This strategy could apply also to other aqueous metal batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of the Zn&#8208;metal anode for aqueous batteries is greatly restricted by catastrophic dendrite growth, intricate hydrogen evolution, and parasitic surface passivation. Herein, a polyanionic hydrogel film is introduced as a protective layer on the Zn anode with the assistance of a silane coupling agent (denoted as Zn&#8211;SHn). The hydrogel framework with zincophilic &#8211;SO3&#8722; functional groups uniformizes the zinc ions flux and transport. Furthermore, such a hydrogel layer chemically bonded on the Zn surface possesses an anti&#8208;catalysis effect, which effectively suppresses both the hydrogen evolution reaction and formation of Zn dendrites. As a result, stable and reversible Zn stripping/plating at various currents and capacities is achieved. A full cell by pairing the Zn&#8211;SHn anode with a NaV3O8&#183;1.5 H2O cathode shows a capacity of around 176 mAh g&#8722;1 with a retention around 67% over 4000 cycles at 10 A g&#8722;1. This polyanionic hydrogel film protection strategy paves a new way for future Zn&#8208;anode design and safe aqueous batteries construction.

         <title>A Vinylene&#8208;Linker&#8208;Based Polymer Acceptor Featuring a Coplanar and Rigid Molecular Conformation Enables High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Over 17% Efficiency</title>

A vinylene&#8208;linker&#8208;based polymer acceptor (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) with rigid and coplanar chain conformations is synthesized, exhibiting redshifted absorption and ordered packing. When employed in all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based devices yield a higher efficiency of 17.1% than PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947;&#8208; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based ones and exhibit robust mechanical stability in flexible devices, suggesting the potential for commercial application.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;art Y&#8208;series polymer acceptors are typically based on a mono&#8208;thiophene linker, which can cause some twisted molecular conformations and thus limit the performance of all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs). Here, a high&#8208;performance polymer acceptor based on vinylene linkers is reported, which leads to surprising changes in the polymers&#8217; molecular conformations, optoelectronic properties, and enhanced photovoltaic performance. It is found that the polymer acceptors based on thiophene or bithiophene linkers (PY&#8208;T&#8208;&#947; and PY&#8208;2T&#8208;&#947;) display significant molecular twisting between end&#8208;groups and linker units, while the vinylene&#8208;based polymer (PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;) exhibits a more coplanar and rigid molecular conformation. As a result, PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947; demonstrates a better conjugation and tighter interchain stacking, which results in higher mobility and a reduced energetic disorder. Furthermore, detailed morphology investigations reveal that the PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based blend exhibits high domain purity and thus a better fill factor in its all&#8208;PSCs. With these, a higher efficiency of 17.1% is achieved in PY&#8208;V&#8208;&#947;&#8208;based all&#8208;PSCs, which is the highest efficiency reported for binary all&#8208;PSCs to date. This work demonstrates that the vinylene&#8208;linker is a superior unit to build polymer acceptors with more coplanar and rigid chain conformation, which is beneficial for polymer aggregation and efficient all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Sr&#8208;Doped Superionic Hydrogen Glass: Synthesis and Properties of SrH22</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Under high pressure, strontium reacts with hydrogen forming molecular SrH22&#8212;a yellow&#8208;orange semiconductor with the bandgap of &#8776;1.8&#160;eV. SrH22 has a glassy superionic hydrogen sublattice stabilized by a solid framework of Sr atoms. The formation of hydrogen glass is a new phenomenon that may have a significant impact on the development of new materials for hydrogen storage and high&#8208;pressure electrochemistry.








Abstract
Recently, several research groups announced reaching the point of metallization of hydrogen above 400&#160;GPa. Despite notable progress, detecting superconductivity in compressed hydrogen remains an unsolved problem. Following the mainstream of extensive investigations of compressed metal polyhydrides, here small doping of molecular hydrogen by strontium is demonstrated to lead to a dramatic reduction in the metallization pressure to &#8776;200&#160;GPa. Studying the high&#8208;pressure chemistry of the Sr&#8211;H system, the formation of several new phases is observed: C2/m&#8208;Sr3H13, pseudocubic SrH6, SrH9 with cubic F4&#175;3m$F\bar{4}3m$&#8208;Sr sublattice, and pseudo tetragonal superionic P1&#8208;SrH22, the metal hydride with the highest hydrogen content (96 at%) discovered so far. High diffusion coefficients of hydrogen in the latter phase DH&#160;= 0.2&#8211;2.1 &#215; 10&#8722;9 m2 s&#8722;1 indicate an amorphous state of the H&#8208;sublattice, whereas the strontium sublattice remains solid. Unlike Ca and Y, strontium forms molecular semiconducting polyhydrides, whereas calcium and yttrium polyhydrides are high&#8208;TC superconductors with an atomic H sublattice. The discovered SrH22, a kind of hydrogen sponge, opens a new class of materials with ultrahigh content of hydrogen.

A novel polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium)&#8208;based n&#8208;type polymer dopant is designed and synthesized. It can dope n&#8208;type conjugated polymers to make n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer conducting materials and thermoelectrics, analogous to poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate). An electron conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1, mobility of 0.86 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1 and power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved.








Abstract
A novel n&#8208;type copolymer dopant polystyrene&#8211;poly(4&#8208;vinyl&#8208;N&#8208;hexylpyridinium fluoride) (PSpF) with fluoride anions is designed and synthesized by reversible addition&#8211;fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization. This is thought to be the first polymeric fluoride dopant. Electrical conductivity of 4.2 S cm&#8211;1 and high power factor of 67 &#181;W m&#8211;1 K&#8211;2 are achieved for PSpF&#8208;doped polymer films, with a corresponding decrease in thermal conductivity as the PSpF concentration is increased, giving the highest ZT of 0.1. An especially high electrical conductivity of 58 S cm&#8211;1 at 88&#160;&#176;C and outstanding thermal stability are recorded. Further, organic transistors of PSpF&#8208;doped thin films exhibit high electron mobility and Hall mobility of 0.86 and 1.70 cm2 V&#8211;1 s&#8211;1, respectively. The results suggest that polystyrene&#8211;poly(vinylpyridinium) salt copolymers with fluoride anions are promising for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type all&#8208;polymer thermoelectrics. This work provides a new way to realize organic thermoelectrics with high conductivity relative to the Seebeck coefficient, high power factor, thermal stability, and broad processing window.

Photolithography
In article number 2200687, Pinak Samal, Stefan Giselbrecht, and co&#8208;workers present an economical and easily accessible direct deep&#8208;UV photolithography method for fabricating microstructures directly in tissue&#8208;culture substrates while requiring minimal processing time. The remarkable straightforwardness of the process enables this class of microengineering techniques to be broadly accessible to diverse research communities.

Cell Adhesion
In article number 2110340, Ramasamy Paulmurugan, Young Keun Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report template&#8208;mediated in situ tuning of nanoligand size and spacing. They demonstrate that submolecular ligand spacing and magnetic ligand anchoring facilitate adhesion&#8208;structure assembly&#8208;mediated pro&#8208;healing polarization of host macrophages. Increasing the ligand spacing significantly suppresses macrophage adhesion whereas increasing both ligand size and spacing slightly inhibits it.

Ex&#8208;Solution Catalysts
In article number 2201109, WooChul Jung, Il&#8208;Doo Kim, and co&#8208;workers reconceptualize the ex&#8208;solution process with the design of a host oxide structure using a metal&#8211;organic framework as an oxide precursor. The critical challenges of ex&#8208;solution, which emerge through conventional synthesis methods, are addressed all at once through this strategy. The ex&#8208;solved nanoparticles promote oxygen chemisorption and function as primary active sites for acetone oxidation reactions in an example process, attaining record&#8208;breaking performance in acetone oxidation and acetone&#8208;detection reactions.

Pixelated Soft Materials
In article number 2109682, P.&#8208;T. Brun and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a robust and predictive approach for the passive assembly of pixelated soft materials. They harness capillary suction in curable elastomers that self&#8208;assemble into complex tessellation patterns before they cure. The resulting pixelated films are highly modular and can be designed to possess localized material properties.

Nanoporous Materials
In article number 2201502, David Fairen&#8208;Jimenez and co&#8208;workers conduct a round&#8208;robin exercise by providing 18 already&#8208;measured adsorption isotherms to sixty&#8208;one labs and show that the reproducibility of the Brunauer&#8211;Emmett&#8211;Teller (BET) area determination in micro&#8208; and mesoporous materials remains a largely ignored issue. To solve this, a new computational approach&#8212;called BETSI&#8212;that expands on the Rouquerol criteria and makes an unambiguous BET area assignment possible is developed.

Nanocrystalline Alloys
In article number 2200354, Jason Trelewicz and co&#8208;workers connect nanocrystalline stability regimes with temperature&#8208;dependent segregation states through in situ mapping of microstructural evolution in Mo&#8211;Au nanometallic multilayers combined with thermodynamic predictions of stable solute configurations. These findings provide a framework for decoupling thermodynamic and kinetic contributions to the stability of nanocrystalline alloys exhibiting a transition from grain&#8208;boundary segregation to solute clustering and nanophase separation at elevated temperatures.

         <title>Recent Advances in Intelligent Wearable Medical Devices Integrating Biosensing and Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) are intensively investigated for personalized healthcare and smart therapy. Recent advances in wearable biosensing&#8722;delivery integrated therapeutic systems are summarized, with an emphasis on functional materials, responsiveness models, working mechanisms, and practices, to provide deep insights into the design, fabrication, and bioapplication of IWMDs.








Abstract
The primary roles of precision medicine are to perform real&#8208;time examination, administer on&#8208;demand medication, and apply instruments continuously. However, most current therapeutic systems implement these processes separately, leading to treatment interruption and limited recovery in patients. Personalized healthcare and smart medical treatment have greatly promoted research on and development of biosensing and drug&#8208;delivery integrated systems, with intelligent wearable medical devices (IWMDs) as typical systems, which have received increasing attention because of their non&#8208;invasive and customizable nature. Here, the latest progress in research on IWMDs is reviewed, including their mechanisms of integrating biosensing and on&#8208;demand drug delivery. The current challenges and future development directions of IWMDs are also discussed.

         <title>Advances in SnO2 for Efficient and Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 27, July 7, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent advances of SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the related interface optimization strategies and applications. The fundamental properties of SnO2 are discussed, with a focus on the defect chemistry, and various preparation methods for improving SnO2 and SnO2/perovskite interface. Finally, the challenges and opportunities for further development of SnO2&#8208;based PSCs are provided.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) based on the regular n&#8211;i&#8211;p device architecture have reached above 25% certified efficiency with continuously reported improvements in recent years. A key common factor for these recent breakthroughs is the development of SnO2 as an effective electron transport layer in these devices. In this article, the key advances in SnO2 development are reviewed, including various deposition approaches and surface treatment strategies, to enhance the bulk and interface properties of SnO2 for highly efficient and stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs. In addition, the general materials chemistry associated with SnO2 along with the corresponding materials challenges and improvement strategies are discussed, focusing on defects, intrinsic properties, and impact on device characteristics. Finally, some SnO2 implementations related to scalable processes and flexible devices are highlighted, and perspectives on the future development of efficient and stable large&#8208;scale perovskite solar modules are also provided.

         <title>Peptide&#8208;based Coacervate&#8208;Core Vesicles with Semipermeable Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coacervates droplets have long been considered as potential protocells to mimic living cells. However, these droplets lack a membrane and are prone to coalescence, limiting their ability to survive, interact, and organize into higher&#8208;order assemblies. Here, we show that tyrosine&#8208;rich peptide conjugates can undergo liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation in a well&#8208;defined pH window and transform into stable membrane&#8208;enclosed protocells by enzymatic oxidation and cross&#8208;linking at the liquid&#8208;liquid interface. The oxidation of the tyrosine&#8208;rich peptides into dityrosine creates a semipermeable, flexible membrane around the coacervates with tunable thickness, which displays strong intrinsic fluorescence, and stabilizes the coacervate protocells against coalescence. The membranes have an effective molecular weight cut&#8208;off of 2.5&#160;kDa, as determined from the partitioning of small dyes and labeled polymers into the membrane&#8208;enclosed coacervate protocells. Flicker spectroscopy reveals a membrane bending rigidity of only 0.1 kBT, which is substantially lower than phospholipid bilayers despite a larger membrane thickness. Finally, we show that enzymes can be stably encapsulated inside the protocells and be supplied with substrates from outside, which opens the way for these membrane&#8208;bound compartments to be used as molecularly crowded artificial cells capable of communication and sensing or as a vehicle for drug delivery.

         <title>Periodic Nanoporous Inorganic Patterns Directly Made by Self&#8208;Ordering of Cracks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed inorganic nanoporous films are key components for the vast spectrum of applications ranging from dew harvesting to solar cells. Shaping them into complex architectures required for advanced functionality, often need time&#8208;consuming or expensive fabrication. In this work, we show how crack formation is harnessed to pattern porous inorganic films in a single step and without using lithography. We developed aqueous ink formulations that, in the presence of polymeric latexes, enable evaporation&#8208;induced, defect&#8208;free periodic arrays of cracks with tunable dimensions over several centimeters. The ink formulation strategy was generalized to more than ten inorganic materials including simple and binary porous oxide and metallic films covering a whole spectrum of properties including insulator, photocatalytic, electrocatalytic, conductive or electrochromic materials. Notably, this approach enables three&#8208;dimensional self&#8208;assembly of cracks by stacking several layers of different compositions, yielding periodic assemblies of polygonal shapes and Janus&#8208;type patterns. The crack patterned periodic arrays of nanoporous TiO2 diffract light, and are used as temperature&#8208;responsive diffraction grating sensors. More broadly, this method represents a unique example of self&#8208;assembly process leading to long&#8208;range order (over several cm) in a robust and controlled way.

Robust neuromorphic computing in Big Data Era calls for long&#8208;term stable crossbar&#8208;array memory cell, however, the elemental segregation in the switch unit and memory unit that inevitably occurs upon cycling breaks the compositional and structural stability, making the whole memory cell failured. Searching a novel material without segregation that can be used for both switch and memory units is the major concern to fabricate robust and reliable non&#8208;volatile cross&#8208;array memory cell. Tellurium (Te) is found recently to be the only peculiar material without segregation for switch but the memory function has not been demonstrated yet. Herein we experimentally confirm apparent piezoelectricity with spontaneous polarization behaviors in elementary two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Te, even in monolayer tellurene (0.4&#160;nm), due to the highly oriented polarization of the molecular structure and the non&#8208;centrosymmetric lattice structure. Large memory window of 7000, low working voltage of 2&#160;V and high on switching current up to 36.6 &#956;A&#8201;&#956;m&#8722;1 are achieved in the as&#8208;fabricated Te based memory device, revealing the great promise of Te for both switch and memory units in one cell without segregation. The piezoelectric Te with spontaneous polarization provides a peculiar platform to build robust, reliable and high&#8208;density logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory chips in neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Activatable Silencing Extracellular Vesicle (PASEV) Sensitizes Cancer Immunotherapy</title>

Abstract
Immunotherapy has delivered impressive outcomes in combating tumor malignancies. However, insufficient immune infiltration and poor immunogenicity within the tumor microenvironment (TME) greatly compromise patient response rates. Here, a photo&#8208;activatable silencing extracellular vesicle (PASEV) is developed for sensitized cancer immunotherapy. PAK4 is a newly&#8208;identified tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;intrinsic &#8220;guard&#8221; associated with immune exclusion. siRNA against PAK4 (siPAK4) is designed and assembled with a photo&#8208;activatable reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;sensitive polymer to form the nanocomplex core, which is further camouflaged by extracellular vesicles from M1 macrophages. PASEV not only serves as a vehicle for packaging, tumor accumulation, and ROS&#8208;responsive release of siPAK4 for potent PAK4 silencing, but also primes the tumor microenvironment (TME) through immunogenic phototherapy, thereby simultaneously boosting intratumoral infiltration and immune activation. The combined immunotherapy elicits robust anticancer immunity, thus showing great promise for fighting cancers. Our work opens a new avenue to simultaneously boost intratumoral infiltration and immune activation for sensitized cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Ultrahigh Kinetic Inductance Superconducting Materials from Spinodal Decomposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;dissipative circuit element with considerably large inductance is indispensable for the noise&#8208;resilient superconducting qubits. Here, spinodal decomposition is utilized to achieve ultrahigh kinetic inductance in the superconducting materials. Model epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N thin films are used and a drastic enhancement in kinetic inductance by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude while maintaining a low microwave loss is demonstrated.








Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications. Despite continuing efforts toward reducing material dimensions to increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, achieving further improvements without compromising material quality has become a fundamental challenge. To this end, a method to drastically increase the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition while maintaining a low microwave loss is proposed. Epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N is used as a model system and the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material disorder is demonstrated. The measured kinetic inductance increases by two to three orders of magnitude compared with the best disordered superconducting nitrides reported to date. This work paves the way for substantially enhancing and deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting quantum&#160;circuits.

         <title>Complement&#8208;Opsonized NIR&#8208;IIb Emissive Immunotracer for Dynamically Monitoring Neutrophils in Inflammation&#8208;Related Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Real&#8208;time monitoring neutrophils dynamics is crucial for timely diagnosis and effective treatment of inflammation&#8208;related diseases, which requires a reliable tracer for in vivo tracking neutrophils. However, immunotracers for neutrophils are extremely limited because of the difficulty in labeling the cells. Inspired by the natural biological function of complement system, we herein proposed the strategy of enhancing complement C3 opsonization of lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles (LnNPs) by modulating their surface chemistry, thus developing a NIR&#8208;IIb emissive nanotracer for neutrophils. Four kinds of surface&#8208;modified LnNPs are fabricated, among which phospholipids DOPG&#8208;modified LnNPs (LnNPs@PG) with weak antifouling ability and hydroxyl groups adsorb more complement C3 proteins and form covalent linkage with C3b active fragments under inflammation condition, inducing enhanced complement C3 opsonization. Therefore, LnNPs@PG with enhanced complement C3 opsonization are capable of efficiently labeling inflammation&#8208;stimulated neutrophils in vivo through complement receptors&#8208;mediated phagocytosis and achieve dynamically monitoring neutrophils during cutaneous wound healing and cerebral ischemia/reperfusion.

         <title>Tunable Strong Coupling in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Subwavelength optical resonators with spatiotemporal control of light are essential to the miniaturization of optical devices. In this work, chemically synthesized transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) nanowires are exploited as a new type of dielectric nanoresonators to simultaneously support pronounced excitonic and Mie resonances. Strong light&#8208;matter couplings and tunable exciton polaritons in individual nanowires are demonstrated. In addition, the excitonic responses can be reversibly modulated with excellent reproducibility, offering the potential for developing tunable optical nanodevices. Being in the mobile colloidal state with highly tunable optical properties, the TMDC nanoresonators will find promising applications in integrated active optical devices, including all&#8208;optical switches and sensors.

         <title>Towards tissue&#8208;like material properties: inducing in situ adaptive behavior in fibrous hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The material's properties of biological tissues are unique. Nature is able to spatially and temporally manipulate (mechanical) properties while maintaining responsiveness towards a variety of cues; all without majorly changing the material's composition. Artificial mimics, synthetic or biomaterial&#8208;based are far less advanced and poorly reproduce the natural cell microenvironment. A viable strategy to generate materials with advanced properties combines different materials into nanocomposites. This work describes nanocomposites of a synthetic fibrous hydrogel, based on polyisocyanides (PIC), that is noncovalently linked to a responsive crosslinker. The introduction of the crosslinker transforms the PIC gel from a static fibrous extracellular matrix mimic to a highly dynamic material that maintains biocompatibility, as demonstrated by in situ modification of the (non)linear mechanical properties and efficient self&#8208;healing properties. Key in the materials design is crosslinking at the fibrillar level using nanoparticles, which, simultaneously may be used to introduce more advanced properties.

Abstract
With the advent of increasingly complex combination strategies of biologics, independent control over their delivery is key to their efficacy; however, current approaches are hindered by limited and independent tunability of their release rates. To overcome these limitations, we used directed evolution to engineer highly specific, low affinity affibody binding partners to multiple therapeutic proteins to independently control protein release rates. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we identified specific affibody binding partners for two proteins with broad therapeutic utility: insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;1 (IGF&#8208;1) and pigment epithelium&#8208;derived factor (PEDF). We discovered protein&#8208;affibody binding interactions specific to these target proteins with equilibrium dissociation constants (KD) between 10&#8211;7 M and 10&#8211;8 M. The affibodies were covalently bound to the backbone of crosslinked hydrogels using click chemistry, enabling the sustained, independent, and simultaneous release of bioactive IGF&#8208;1 and PEDF over 7 days. The system was tested with C57BL/6J mice in vivo, and the affibody&#8208;controlled release of IGF&#8208;1 resulted in sustained activity when compared to bolus IGF&#8208;1 delivery. We demonstrate a new, broadly applicable approach to tune the release of therapeutic proteins simultaneously and independently and thus pave the way for precise control over the delivery of multicomponent therapies.

         <title>Anode Catalysts in Anion&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Electrolysis Without Supporting Electrolyte: Conductivity, Dynamics, and Ionomer Degradation</title>

Abstract
Anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzers (AEMWEs) in principle operate without soluble electrolyte using earth&#8208;abundant catalysts and cell materials and thus lower the cost of green H2. Current systems lack competitive performance and durability needed for commercialization. One critical issue is a poor understanding of catalyst&#8208;specific degradation processes in the electrolyzer. While non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal (non&#8208;PGM) oxygen&#8208;evolution catalysts show excellent performance and durability in strongly alkaline electrolyte, this has not transferred directly to pure&#8208;water AEMWEs. Here, AEMWEs with five non&#8208;PGM anode catalysts are built and the catalysts&#8217; structural stability and interactions with the alkaline ionomer are characterized during electrolyzer operation and post&#8208;mortem. The results show catalyst electrical conductivity is one key to obtaining high&#8208;performing systems and that many non&#8208;PGM catalysts restructure during operation. Dynamic Fe sites correlate with enhanced degradation rates, as does the addition of soluble Fe impurities. In contrast, electronically conductive Co3O4 nanoparticles (without Fe in the crystal structure) yield AEMWEs from simple, standard preparation methods, with performance and stability comparable to IrO2. These results reveal the fundamental dynamic catalytic processes resulting in AEMWE device failure under relevant conditions, demonstrate a viable non&#8208;PGM catalysts for AEMWE, and illustrate underlying design rules for engineering anode catalyst/ionomer layers with higher performance and durability.

         <title>Endocytosis&#8208;independent and Cancer&#8208;selective Cytosolic Protein Delivery via Reversible Tagging with LAT1 substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein drugs targeting intracellular machineries have shown profound therapeutic potentials, but their clinical utilities are greatly hampered by the lack of efficient cytosolic delivery techniques. Existing strategies mainly rely on nanocarriers or conjugated cell penetrating peptides (CPPs), which often have drawbacks such as materials complexity/toxicity, lack of cell specificity, and endolysosomal entrapment. Herein, we report a unique carrier&#8208;free approach for mediating cancer&#8208;selective and endocytosis&#8208;free cytosolic protein delivery. Proteins were sequentially modified with 4&#8208;nitrophenyl 4&#8208;(4,4,5,5&#8208;tetramethyl&#8208;1,3,2&#8208;dioxaborolan&#8208;2&#8208;yl) benzyl carbonate as the H2O2&#8208;responsive domain and 3,4&#8208;dihydroxy&#8208;L&#8208;phenylalanine as the substrate of L&#8208;type amino acid transporter 1 (LAT1). Thus, the pro&#8208;protein could be directly transported into tumor cells by over&#8208;expressed LAT1 on cell membranes, bypassing endocytosis and endolysosomal entrapment. In the cytosol, over&#8208;produced H2O2 restored the protein structure and activity. Using this technique, versatile proteins were delivered into tumor cells with robust efficiency, including toxins, enzymes, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 ribonucleoprotein, and antibodies. Furthermore, intravenously injected pro&#8208;protein of saporin showed potent anti&#8208;cancer efficacy in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice, without provoking systemic toxicity. Such a facile and versatile pro&#8208;protein platform may benefit the development of protein pharmaceuticals.

         <title>Light&#8208;Based Printing of Leachable Salt Molds for Facile Shaping of Complex Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dissolvable salt&#8208;printed templates allow shaping of hard&#8208;to&#8208;print materials. The control of photoadditive and diluent concentrations in the salt&#8208;based ink is essential to achieve high&#8208;resolution printing of crack&#8208;free objects. Optimal ink formulations enable shaping of materials for various applications from lightweight construction to 3D cell cultures.








Abstract
3D printing is a powerful manufacturing technology for shaping materials into complex structures. While the palette of printable materials continues to expand, the rheological and chemical requisites for printing are not always easy to fulfill. Here, a universal manufacturing platform is reported for shaping materials into intricate geometries without the need for their printability, but instead using light&#8208;based printed salt structures as leachable molds. The salt structures are printed using photocurable resins loaded with NaCl particles. The printing, debinding, and sintering steps involved in the process are systematically investigated to identify ink formulations enabling the preparation of crack&#8208;free salt templates. The experiments reveal that the formation of a load&#8208;bearing network of salt particles is essential to prevent cracking of the mold during the process. By infiltrating the sintered salt molds and leaching the template in water, complex&#8208;shaped architectures are created from diverse compositions such as biomedical silicone, chocolate, light metals, degradable elastomers, and fiber composites, thus demonstrating the universal, cost&#8208;effective, and sustainable nature of this new manufacturing platform.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of metals with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study and electrochemical tests demonstrate the improved electrodeposition/dissolution behavior, lower polarization, and higher average coulombic efficiency for P2S5 and MoS2.








Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method is reported to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior. The P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8776;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8776;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;modified Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8776;3.2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

         <title>Nonvolatile Control of Metal&#8211;Insulator Transition in VO2 by Ferroelectric Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior in a vanadium dioxide is demonstrated by employing the heteroepitaxial Mott transistor. Due to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectricity is successfully proven by showing a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible memory performance.








Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, an approach to control a metal&#8211;insulator transition (MIT) behavior is developed by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT can be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#181;C cm&#8722;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8776;102), long retention time (&#8776;104 s), and high endurance (&#8776;103 cycles). Furthermore, the structural phase transition of VO2 is corroborated by ferroelectric polarization through in situ Raman mapping analysis. This study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

         <title>Green Electrosynthesis of 5,5&#8242;&#8208;Azotetrazolate Energetic Materials Plus Energy&#8208;Efficient Hydrogen Production Using Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique coupling system for energy&#8208;saving hydrogen production and green electrosynthesis of energetic materials (EMs) is developed. The coupling system displays an ultralow cell voltage of 1.35&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing a reduction of 410&#160;mV relative to overall water splitting. This strategy solves the problems of high&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption hydrogen production and the hazardous traditional synthesis conditions of EMs.








Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, that is, oxygen evolution (OER) and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish OER is a significant limiting step that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicals HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials (EMs) plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts is introduced. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8722;10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature conditions, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic EMs while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

         <title>An Encapsulation&#8208;Based Sodium Storage via Zn&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Implanted Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing a functional encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage void with abundant pore structure and enriched Zn single atom sites in the inner wall is presented here. Zn single atoms provide abundant selective sodiophilic nucleation sites. Due to the rich pore structure, ZIF&#8208;derived carbon shells can provide geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels to maintain fast electron/ion contact, benefiting for encapsulating large amounts of metallic sodium.








Abstract
The properties of high theoretical capacity, low cost, and large potential of metallic sodium (Na) has strongly promoted the development of rechargeable sodium&#8208;based batteries. However, the issues of infinite volume variation, unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI), and dendritic sodium causes a rapid decline in performance and notorious safety hazards. Herein, a highly reversible encapsulation&#8208;based sodium storage by designing a functional hollow carbon nanotube with Zn single atom sites embedded in the carbon shell (ZnSA&#8208;HCNT) is achieved. The appropriate tube space can encapsulate bulk sodium inside; the inner enriched ZnSA sites provide abundant sodiophilic sites, which can evidently reduce the nucleation barrier of Na deposition. Moreover, the carbon shell derived from ZIF&#8208;8 provides geometric constraints and excellent ion/electron transport channels for the rapid transfer of Na+ due to its pore&#8208;rich shell, which can be revealed by in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM). As expected, Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT anodes present steady long&#8208;term performance in symmetrical battery (&gt;900 h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). Moreover, superior electrochemical performance of Na@ZnSA&#8208;HCNT||PB full cells can be delivered. This work develops a new strategy based on carbon nanotube encapsulation of metallic sodium, which improves the safety and cycling performance of sodium metal anode.

         <title>Triclinic Metamaterials by Tristable Origami with Reprogrammable Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Geometrical frustration induced anisotropy and inhomogeneity are explored to achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry. Based on such guidelines, we&#160;present a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal symmetry, which is originated from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson's effect. Such effect, associated to reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant math formulae. The nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resembles linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with symmetries that were&#160;hitherto non&#8208;existent, leading to triclinic metamaterials with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation control and compliant&#160;micro&#8208;robots.

         <title>Ultrafine Silver Nanoparticle Encapsulated Porous Molecular Traps for Discriminative Photoelectrochemical Detection of Mustard Gas Simulants by Synergistic Size&#8208;exclusion and Site&#8208;specific Recognition</title>

Abstract
The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photo&#8208;electrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, we developed a fast and facile protocol to fabricate sub&#8208;1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected MOF materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF&#8208;101 can selectively recognize 9 different mustard gas simulants, including 2&#8208;chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size&#8208;exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&#8211;1), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long&#8208;term working stability (at least 30 days) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid, discriminative, and portable detection of highly toxic chemical warfare agents is extremely important for response to public security emergencies but remains a challenge. One plausible solution involves the integration of porous molecular traps onto a photo-electrochemical (PEC) sensor. Here, we developed a fast and facile protocol to fabricate sub-1&#160;nm AgNPs encapsulated hydrogen-bonded organic framework (HOF) nanocomposite materials through an in situ photoreduction and subsequent encapsulation process. Compared to traditional semiconductors and selected MOF materials, these AgNPs@HOFs show significantly enhanced photocurrent. Most importantly, the portable PEC device based on AgNPs@HOF-101 can selectively recognize 9 different mustard gas simulants, including 2-chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES), based on synergistic size-exclusion and specific recognition. The extremely low detection limit for CEES (15.8&#160;nmol L&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;1&lt;/sup&gt;), reusability (at least 30 cycles), and long-term working stability (at least 30 days) of the portable PEC device warrant its use as a chemical warfare agents (CWAs) sensor in practical field settings. More broadly, this work indicates that integrating porous molecular traps onto PEC sensors offers a promising strategy to further develop portable devices for CWAs detection with both ultrahigh sensitivity and selectivity.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure as Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new kind of photodynamic semiconducting polymer nanoparticles with surface mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) is developed to achieve self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining excellent immunogenic cell death and lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaera&#8208;like multivalent programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1&#160;blockade. SPSS NPs can not only effectively suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge.








Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, a new kind of semiconducting polymer (SP) nanoparticles is developed, featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade therapy. The SPs with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which can massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic NP surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of programmed cell death ligand&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;L1)&#160;in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs can not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1&#160;blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

         <title>Unraveling the Correlation between Raman and Photoluminescence in Monolayer MoS2 through Machine Learning Models</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with intense and tunable photoluminescence (PL) have opened up new opportunities for optoelectronic and photonic applications such as light&#8208;emitting diodes, photodetectors, and single&#8208;photon emitters. Among the standard characterization tools for 2D materials, Raman spectroscopy stands out as a fast and non&#8208;destructive technique capable of probing material crystallinities and perturbations such as doping and strain. However, a comprehensive understanding of the correlation between photoluminescence and Raman spectra in monolayer MoS2 remains elusive due to its highly nonlinear nature. Here, we systematically explore the connections between PL signatures and Raman modes, providing comprehensive insights into the physical mechanisms correlating PL and Raman features. Our analysis further disentangles the strain and doping contributions from the Raman spectra through machine learning models. First, we deploy a DenseNet to predict PL maps by spatial Raman maps. Moreover, we apply a gradient boosted trees model (XGBoost) with Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) to bridge the impact of individual Raman features in PL features, allowing us to link the strain and doping of monolayer MoS2. Last, we adopt a support vector machine (SVM) to project PL features on Raman frequencies. Our work may serve as a methodology for applying machine learning in 2D material characterizations and providing the knowledge for tuning and synthesizing 2D semiconductors for high&#8208;yield photoluminescence.

         <title>All&#8208;Printed Ultrahigh&#8208;Responsivity MoS2 Nanosheet Photodetectors Enabled by Megasonic Exfoliation</title>

Abstract
Printed two&#8208;dimensional materials, derived from solution&#8208;processed inks, offer scalable and cost&#8208;effective routes to mechanically flexible optoelectronics. With micron&#8208;scale control and broad processing latitude, aerosol&#8208;jet printing (AJP) is of particular interest for all&#8208;printed circuits and systems. Here, we utilize AJP to achieve ultrahigh&#8208;responsivity photodetectors consisting of well&#8208;aligned, percolating networks of semiconducting MoS2 nanosheets and graphene electrodes on flexible polyimide substrates. Ultrathin (&#8776;1.2&#160;nm thick) and high aspect ratio (&#8776;1&#160;&#956;m lateral size) MoS2 nanosheets are obtained by electrochemical intercalation followed by megasonic atomization during AJP, which not only aerosolizes the inks but also further exfoliates the nanosheets. The incorporation of the high boiling point solvent terpineol into the MoS2 ink is critical to achieving a highly aligned and flat thin&#8208;film morphology following AJP as confirmed by grazing incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering and atomic force microscopy. Following AJP, curing is achieved with photonic annealing, which yields quasi&#8208;ohmic contacts and photoactive channels with responsivities exceeding 103 A/W that outperform previously reported all&#8208;printed visible&#8208;light photodetectors by over 3 orders of magnitude. Megasonic exfoliation coupled with properly designed AJP ink formulations enables the superlative optoelectronic properties of ultrathin MoS2 nanosheets to be preserved and exploited for the scalable additive manufacturing of mechanically flexible optoelectronics.

         <title>Asymmetric Co&#8211;N3P1 Trifunctional Catalyst with Tailored Electronic Structures Enabling Boosted Activities and Corrosion Resistance in Uninterrupted Seawater Splitting System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Employing seawater splitting systems to generate hydrogen can be economically advantageous but still remains challenging, particularly for designing efficient and high Cl&#8211;&#8208;corrosion resistance trifunctional catalysts toward oxygen reduction (ORR), oxygen evolution (OER), and hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). Herein, single Co&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts with well&#8208;defined symmetric Co&#8211;N4 sites were selected as atomic platforms for electronic structure tailoring. Density function theory revealed that P&#8208;doping into Co&#8211;N&#8211;C could lead to the formation of asymmetric Co&#8211;N3P1 sites with symmetry&#8208;breaking electronic structures, enabling the affinity of strong oxygen&#8208;containing intermediates, moderate H adsorption, and weak Cl&#8211; adsorption. Thus ORR/OER/HER activities and stability are optimized simultaneously with high Cl&#8211; corrosion resistance. The asymmetric Co&#8211;N3P1 structure&#8208;based catalyst with boosted ORR/OER/HER performance endowed seawater&#8208;based Zn&#8211;air batteries (S&#8211;ZABs) with superior long&#8208;term stability over 750 h and allowed seawater splitting to operate continuously for 1000 h. A self&#8208;driven seawater splitting powered by S&#8211;ZABs gives ultra&#8208;high H2 production rates of 497&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1. This work is the first to advance the scientific understanding of the competitive adsorption mechanism between Cl&#8211; and reaction intermediates from the perspective of electronic structure, paving the way for synthesizing efficient trifunctional catalysts with high Cl&#8211; corrosion resistance.

         <title>Excimer formation in non&#8208;van der Waals 2D semiconductor Bi2O2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The layered semiconductor Bi2O2Se is a promising new&#8208;type two&#8208;dimensional material that holds layered structure via electrostatic forces instead of van der Waals (vdW) attractions. Aside from the huge success in device performance, the non&#8208;vdW nature in Bi2O2Se with a built&#8208;in interlayer electric field has also provided an appealing platform for investigating unique photoexcited carrier dynamics. Here, we present experimental evidence for the observation of excimers in multi&#8208;layer Bi2O2Se nanosheets via transient absorption spectroscopy. We have found that the excimer formation is the primary decay pathway of photoexcited excitons and established three&#8208;stage excimer dynamics with corresponding time scales. Excitation fluence&#8208;dependent excimer dynamics further suggest that the excimer is diffusive and its formation can be simply described as excitons relaxed to an excimer geometry. This work indicates the outstanding promise of unique excitonic processes in Bi2O2Se, which may motivate novel device designs.

         <title>Anhydrous Fast Proton Transport Boosted by Hydrogen Bond Network in A Dense Oxide&#8208;ion Array of &#945;&#8208;MoO3</title>

Abstract
Developing high&#8208;power battery chemistry is an urgent task to buffer fluctuating renewable energies and achieve a sustainable and flexible power supply. Owing to the small size of proton and its ultrahigh mobility in water via the Grotthuss mechanism, aqueous proton batteries are an attractive candidate for high&#8208;power energy storage devices. Grotthuss proton transfer is ultrafast owing to the hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks of water molecules. In this work, we discover similar continuous hydrogen&#8208;bond networks in a dense oxide&#8208;ion array of solid &#945;&#8208;MoO3, which facilitate the anhydrous proton transport even without structural water. The fast proton transfer and accumulation that occurs during (de)intercalation in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 is unveiled using both experiments and first&#8208;principles calculations. Coupled with a zinc anode and a super&#8208;concentrated Zn2+/H+ electrolyte, the proton transport mechanism in anhydrous hydrogen&#8208;bonded networks realizes an aqueous MoO3&#8208;Zn battery with large capacity, long life, and fast charge&#8208;discharge abilities.

         <title>Osteoimmunity&#8208;Regulating Biomimetically Hierarchical Scaffold for Augmented Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Engineering a proper immune response following biomaterial implantation is essential to bone tissue regeneration. Herein, a biomimetically hierarchical scaffold composed of deferoxamine@poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (DFO@PCL) nanoparticle, manganese carbonyl (MnCO) nanosheet, gelatin methacryloyl hydrogel, and polylactide/hydroxyapatite (PLA/HA) matrix was fabricated to augment bone repair by facilitating the balance of immune system and bone metabolism. First, a 3D printed stiff scaffold with a well&#8208;organized gradient structure mimicked the cortical and cancellous bone tissues; meanwhile, an inside infusion of a soft hydrogel further endowed the scaffold characteristics of extracellular matrices. A Fenton&#8208;like reaction between MnCO and endogenous hydrogen peroxide generated at implant&#8722;tissue site triggered continuous release of carbon monoxide and Mn2+, thus significantly lessening inflammatory response by up&#8208;regulating M2 phenotype of macrophages, which also secreted vascular endothelial growth factor to induce vascular formation. Through activating the hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; pathway, Mn2+ and DFO@PCL further promoted angiogenesis. Moreover, DFO inhibited osteoclast differentiation and synergistically collaborated with the osteoinductive activity of HA. Based on amounts of in vitro and in vivo data, strong immunomodulatory, intensive angiogenic, weak osteoclastogenic, and superior osteogenic abilities of such osteoimmunity&#8208;regulating scaffold presented a profound effect on improving bone regeneration, which puts forward a worthy base and positive enlightenment for large&#8208;scale bone defect repair.

         <title>Surface Transformation Enables Dendrite&#8208;free Zinc Metal Anode in Nonaqueous Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Significant challenges remain in developing rechargeable zinc batteries mainly because of reversibility problems on zinc metal anodes. The dendritic growth and hydrogen evolution on zinc electrodes are major obstacles to overcome in developing practical and safe zinc batteries. Here, a dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn metal anode with high Coulombic efficiency up to 99.6% over 300 cycles is realized in a newly&#8208;designed nonaqueous electrolyte, which comprises an inexpensive zinc salt, zinc acetate, and a green low&#8208;cost solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide. A surface transformation on Cu substrate plays a critical role in facilitating the dendrite&#8208;free deposition process, which lowers the diffusion energy barrier of Zn atoms, leading to a uniform and compact thin film for zinc plating. Furthermore, the in situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy reveals the plating process via a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mechanism and the stripping process through an edge&#8208;dissolution mechanism. In addition, Zn||Mo6S8 full cells exhibit excellent electrochemical performance in terms of cycling stability and rate capability. This work presents a new opportunity to develop nonaqueous rechargeable zinc batteries.

         <title>The Energy Level Conundrum of Organic Semiconductors in Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The frontier molecular energy levels of organic semiconductors (OSC) are decisive for their fundamental function and efficiency in optoelectronics. However, the precise determination of these energy levels and their variation when using different techniques makes it hard to compare and establish design rules. In this paper, we determine the energy levels of 33 organic semiconductors via cyclic voltammetry (CV), density functional theory (DFT), ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS), and low&#8208;energy inverse photoelectron spectroscopy (LE&#8208;IPES). We fabricate solar cells to obtain key device parameters and relate them to the significant differences in the energy levels and offsets obtained from different methods. In contrast to CV, the photovoltaic gap measured using photoelectron spectroscopy (PES) correlates well with the experimental device Voc. We demonstrate that high&#8208;performing systems such as PM6:Y6 and WF3F:Y6, which were previously reported to have negligible ionization energy (IE) offsets (&#916;IE), possess sizable &#916;IE of &#8764;0.5&#160;eV, determined by PES. Using various D&#8208;A blends, we demonstrate that &#916;IE plays a key role in charge generation. In contrast to earlier reports, we show a vanishing &#916;IE is detrimental to device performance. Overall, these findings establish a solid base for reliably evaluating material energetics and interpreting property&#8208;performance relationships in organic solar cells.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Active layers for (semi&#8208;)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy&#8208;harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing donor component. An in&#8208;depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in&#8208;depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.








Abstract
The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow&#8208;bandgap near&#8208;IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs).

&lt;p&gt;Active layers for (semi-)transparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs) must meet high transparency requirements for integrated energy-harvesting solutions. A pathway towards high visible transparency is combining a near-infrared-absorbing acceptor material with small fractions of a visible-light-absorbing donor component. An in-depth analysis of three blend systems yields an in-depth understanding of the device physics upon reduction of the donor.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The charge generation&#8211;recombination dynamics in three narrow-bandgap near-IR absorbing nonfullerene (NFA) based organic photovoltaic (OPV) systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20% are investigated. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible-range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend average visible transmittance (AVT) values of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to photoconversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non-geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, this study gives an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST-OPVs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

         <title>A Snakeskin&#8208;Inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;Adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Survivability in complex environments is in high demand but challenging in flexible electronics or soft robotics. Snakeskin can serve as bioinspiration for employing electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) as a generic strategy to protect itself&#160;and the underlying objects from external damage. Specifically, a new concept of flexible &#8220;E&#8208;armor&#8221; as an upgrade of soft &#8220;E&#8208;skin&#8221; is introduced.








Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armor or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) is proposed, which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of the kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of the soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying a conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, an Unheeded&#160;Killer of Mg Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An astonishingly uniform electroplating morphology is proven under practical current density and areal capacity in rechargeable Mg batteries, and an asymmetric phenomenon between the plating and stripping processes is discovered. More critically, a nonlinear volcano relation between the non&#8208;uniformity of the stripping morphology and the current density is proposed, which is defined by the distribution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions at the interface.








Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/stripping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg&#8208;metal anodes in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode when cycling under a practical areal capacity (&gt;4&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2), is of rising concern. The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, it is illustrated that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in a wide range of current densities (&#8804;5&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2). However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under moderate current densities (0.1&#8211;1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing failure of the Mg&#8208;metal anode or short circuit of the battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in situ spectroscopy, it is illustrated that this current&#8208;dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of the Mg&#8208;metal anode must be considered comprehensively for practical Mg&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility. The experimental results reveal that the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy.








Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and cannot overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) are synthesized with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect is explored. Specifically, only the Pt2Au4 cluster displays catalase&#8208;like activity, while the others do not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, the Pt2Au4 cluster modulates tumor hypoxia as well as increases the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances the&#160;cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics&#8208;Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Defect&#8208;rich MoS2 QDs are obtained via a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy to show enhanced photoluminescence and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation due to great defect/active sites elevation.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to the contribution of vacancies to their unique optical, physical, catalytic, and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, by applying a mild biomineralization&#8208;assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy, blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects are fabricated. The two&#8208;stage synthesis begins with a bottom&#8208;up synthesis of original MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that creates high sulfur&#8208;vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increases the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. An increase in defect density is shown to bring about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; which is further validated with density functional theory calculations. There is strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1, accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributes to assist e&#8722;&#8211;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unravels another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Annealing&#8208;Free Gold Printing via Anion&#8208;Assisted Photochemical Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition&#8208;based gold patterning method, which can&#160;direct print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post annealing is presented. The technique combines Digital Light Processing&#8208;based projection lithography with specific ion effects. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au is demonstrated, with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal transductions.








Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal&#8208;patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost have limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08 &#215; 107 S m&#8722;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment, is introduced. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. The significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8722; ions, in the printing process is presented. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. The high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes are demonstrated with reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. This work exploits the potential of photochemical&#8208;deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart luminescent materials with tunable multicolor afterglows in response to excitation and delay time can be facilely constructed with aqueous processable polymers through physical doping. The afterglow colors can further be finely modulated by the variation of the doping concentration, co&#8208;doping, and the triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy&#8208;transfer process.








Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates are developed, which demonstrate following advantages: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable characteristics, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet&#8208;to&#8208;singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET&#8208;mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective strategy of dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS)&#160;is developed. Highly efficient nonhalogenated organic solar cells are fabricated by slot&#8208;die coating by the DSDS strategy without additives and complex post&#8208;treatments.








Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ), which causes excessive charge recombination, hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy is proposed to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the nonhalogen solvents, and creating a graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% is obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% is preserved in a wide range of active&#8208;layer thickness. The unique film&#8208;formation mechanism is further identified during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between the donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering the boundary structures in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials provides an unprecedented opportunity to program the physical properties of the materials with extensive tunability and realize innovative devices with advanced functionalities. However, structural engineering technology is still in its infancy, and creating artificial boundary structures with high reproducibility remains difficult. In this review, we discuss about various emergent properties of 2D materials with different grain boundaries, and the current techniques to control the structures. We also discuss the remaining challenges for scalable and reproducible structure control and our outlook on the future directions of the related techniques.

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Magnon&#8208;mediated Magnetization Switching in All&#8208;oxide Heterostructures with Perpendicular Magnetic Anisotropy</title>

Abstract
The search for efficient approaches to realize local switching of magnetic moments in spintronic devices has attracted extensive attention. One of the most promising approaches is the electrical manipulation of magnetization through electron&#8208;mediated spin torque. However, the Joule heat generated via electron motion unavoidably causes substantial energy dissipation and potential damage to spintronic devices. Here, all&#8208;oxide heterostructures of SrRuO3/NiO/SrIrO3 were&#160; epitaxially grown on SrTiO3 single&#8208;crystal substrates following the order of the ferromagnetic transition metal oxide SrRuO3 with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, insulating and antiferromagnetic NiO, and metallic transition metal oxide SrIrO3 with strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling. We&#160; demonstrate that instead of the electron spin torques, the magnon torques present in the antiferromagnetic NiO layer could&#160; directly manipulate the perpendicular magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. This magnon mechanism may significantly reduce the electron motion&#8211;related energy dissipation from electron&#8208;mediated spin currents. Interestingly, the threshold current density to generate a sufficient magnon current to manipulate the magnetization was&#160; one order of magnitude smaller than that in conventional metallic systems. These findings suggest a route for developing highly efficient all&#8208;oxide spintronic devices operated by magnon current.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Iron Anchored Tubular g&#8208;C3N4 Catalysts for Ultrafast Fenton&#8208;Like Reaction: Roles of High&#8208;Valency Iron&#8208;Oxo Species and Organic Radicals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomically dispersing Fe(III) sites into fine&#8208;tuned nitrogen&#8208;rich graphitic carbon nitride nanotubes are designed for peracetic acid activation and further for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. This work opens a new avenue to develop heterogenous catalytic systems with higher reactivity and better durability using a double engine mechanism.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of understanding of the fundamental mechanism, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCNs) are designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) is selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogenous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8211;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity, outperforming equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valency iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; is detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation is proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;Based Intrinsically Stretchable 2D&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A protocol to fabricate highly efficient organic light&#8208;emitting diodes that use an intrinsically stretchable 2D&#8208;contact electrode topped with graphene is reported. As a benefit of the fast carrier mobility with complete 2D contact with the organic material and the tunable work function of the 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electro (TCSE), the limited charge injection of the widely used silver&#8208;nanowire&#8208;based stretchable electrode is solved.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of ISOLEDs have been highly inferior compared with their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at 1D metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. Herein, highly efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based 2D&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires are demonstrated. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yields a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a 3 inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED is demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;Derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanoscale polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is prepared from colloidal organization of nanocapsules to nanograins by gel&#8208;casting in a non&#8208;pressure environment. SINPG exhibits ultrahigh strength, unprecedent plasticity, and excellent deformation, acting as a metallic material in compression tests. The cleavage associated with typical van der Waals materials is avoided with SINPG.








Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. The development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG) is discussed herein. The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <title>A Skin&#8208;Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step&#8208;by&#8208;step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.








Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real&#8208;life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging.

     alt="A Skin-Inspired Design Integrating Mechano&#8211;Chemical&#8211;Thermal Robustness into Superhydrophobic Coatings"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A skin-inspired triple-layered coating (STC) concept is proposed. The STC solves the contradiction between the superhydrophobicity and other functionalities (such as abrasion resistance, adhesion, and flame retardancy). Based on a step-by-step spraying process and feasible control of the components of each layer, continuous interfaces within layers are achieved, endowing the integration of excellent overall performances into one coating.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and antiflaming and a high level of mechano&#8211;chemical&#8211;thermal robustness is crucial in real-life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and&#160;thus,&#160;simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, an integral skin-inspired triple-layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials is proposed. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength, and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anticorrosion, and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong antiabrasion on surfaces and adhesion with the substrate. Such an all-in-one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving.

         <title>Quantum Conductance in Memristive Devices: Fundamentals, Developments, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum conductance effects in memristive devices are reviewed, from fundamentals of electrochemical phenomena underlying memristive functionalities to ballistic electronic conduction transport in atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments. Related challenges in nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena at the nanoscale are analyzed together with opportunities and envisioned applications for memristive devices working in the quantum regime.








Abstract
Quantum effects in novel functional materials and new device concepts represent a potential breakthrough for the development of new information processing technologies based on quantum phenomena. Among the emerging technologies, memristive elements that exhibit resistive switching, which relies on the electrochemical formation/rupture of conductive nanofilaments, exhibit quantum conductance effects at room temperature. Despite the underlying resistive switching mechanism having been exploited for the realization of next&#8208;generation memories and neuromorphic computing architectures, the potentialities of quantum effects in memristive devices are still rather unexplored. Here, a comprehensive review on memristive quantum devices, where quantum conductance effects can be observed by coupling ionics with electronics, is presented. Fundamental electrochemical and physicochemical phenomena underlying device functionalities are introduced, together with fundamentals of electronic ballistic conduction transport in nanofilaments. Quantum conductance effects including quantum mode splitting, stability, and random telegraph noise are analyzed, reporting experimental techniques and challenges of nanoscale metrology for the characterization of memristive phenomena. Finally, potential applications and future perspectives are envisioned, discussing how memristive devices with controllable atomic&#8208;sized conductive filaments can represent not only suitable platforms for the investigation of quantum phenomena but also promising building blocks for the realization of integrated quantum systems working in air at room temperature.

         <title>Programming Cellular Alignment in Engineered Cardiac Tissue via Bioprinting Anisotropic Organ Building Blocks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aligned cardiac tissues are produced by 3D bioprinting a densely cellular ink composed of anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs). The aOBBs undergo shear&#8208;induced alignment along the print path when extruded through a tapered nozzle. This method enables programmable control over cardiac tissue alignment across multiple scales.








Abstract
The ability to replicate the 3D myocardial architecture found in human hearts is a grand challenge. Here, the fabrication of aligned cardiac tissues via bioprinting anisotropic organ building blocks (aOBBs) composed of human induced pluripotent stem cell derived cardiomyocytes (hiPSC&#8208;CMs) is reported. A bioink composed of contractile cardiac aOBBs is first generated and aligned cardiac tissue sheets with linear, spiral, and chevron features are printed. Next, aligned cardiac macrofilaments are printed, whose contractile force and conduction velocity increase over time and exceed the performance of spheroid&#8208;based cardiac tissues. Finally, the ability to spatially control the magnitude and direction of contractile force by printing cardiac sheets with different aOBB alignment is highlighted. This research opens new avenues to generating functional cardiac tissue with high cell density and complex cellular alignment.

         <title>Obstructed Surface States as the Descriptor for Predicting Catalytic Active Sites in Inorganic Crystalline Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic obstructed surfaces states can be a descriptor for the fast and precise identification of catalytic active sites. High&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicted by simply counting the density of obstructed Wannier charge centers under the framework of classic d band theory.








Abstract
The discovery of new catalysts that are efficient and sustainable is a major research endeavor for many industrial chemical processes. This requires an understanding and determination of the catalytic origins, which remains a challenge. Here, a novel method to identify the position of active sites based on searching for crystalline symmetry&#8208;protected obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) that have metallic surface states is described. The obstructed Wannier charge centers (OWCCs) in OAIs are pinned by symmetries at some empty Wyckoff positions so that surfaces that accommodate these sites are guaranteed to have metallic obstructed surface states (OSSs). It is proposed and confirmed that the OSSs are the catalytic activity origins for crystalline materials. The theory on 2H&#8208;MoTe2, 1T&#8242;&#8208;MoTe2, and NiPS3 bulk single crystals is verified, whose active sites are consistent with the calculations. Most importantly, several high&#8208;efficiency catalysts are successfully identified just by considering the number of OWCCs and the symmetry. Using the real&#8208;space&#8208;invariant theory applied to a database of 34 013 topologically trivial insulators, 1788 unique OAIs are identified, of which 465 are potential high&#8208;performance catalysts. The new methodology will facilitate and accelerate the discovery of new catalysts for a wide range of heterogeneous redox reactions.

         <title>Near&#8208;Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes utilizing a Europium&#8208;Activated Calcium Oxide Phosphor with External Quantum Efficiency of up to 54.7%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The photoluminescence quantum efficiency of a CaO:Eu NIR phosphor is significantly improved and stabilized at high temperature. By utilizing GeO2 decomposition, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are effectively repaired. A record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminescence materials with broadband emissions are necessary for the development of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based light sources. However, most known NIR&#8208;emitting materials are limited by their low external quantum efficiency. This work demonstrates how the photoluminescence quantum efficiency of europium&#8208;activated calcium oxide (CaO:Eu) NIR phosphor can be significantly improved and stabilized at operating temperatures of LEDs. A carbon paper wrapping technology is innovatively developed and used during the solid&#8208;state sintering to promote the reduction of Eu3+ into Eu2+. In parallel, the oxygen vacancies in the CaO lattice are repaired utilizing GeO2 decomposition. Through this process, a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 54.7% at 740 nm is obtained with a thermal stability greatly improved from 57% to 90% at 125&#160;&#176;C. The as&#8208;fabricated NIR&#8208;LEDs reach record photoelectric efficiency (100 mA@23.4%) and output power (100 mA&#8202;@&#8202;319.5 mW). This discovery of high&#8208;performance phosphors will open new research avenues for broadband NIR LED light sources in a variety of photonics applications.

         <title>Reinforced Layered Double Hydroxide Oxygen&#8208;Evolution Electrocatalysts: A Polyoxometallic Acid Wet&#8208;Etching Approach and Synergistic Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multiskilled polyoxometallic acid etching approach to ingeniously reconstructing nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides through morphology optimization, active site synergistic regulation, and defect regulation as a promising electrode post&#8208;treatment technique toward industrial anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrolyzer applications is reported.








Abstract
Nickel&#8211;iron&#8208;based layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) have attracted tremendous research and industrial interests for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysis. However, methodologies on simultaneous regulation of performance&#8208;influencing factors remain scarce and their real synergistic effects are not clear enough. Herein, a versatile polyoxometallic acids (POMs) etching approach is reported to ingeniously reconstruct NiFe LDH, including 3D morphological nanotailoring, Fe3+ and &#945;&#8208;Ni(OH)2 active species reconfiguration, creation of multiple Ni, Fe, and O vacancies, and intercalation of POM polyanionic clusters. The experimental and theoretical data collaboratively unveil that control of the key performance&#8208;influencing factors and their multiple synergistic mechanisms dominantly contribute to the step&#8208;like OER performance enhancement. The reinforced electrocatalyst is further produced with low cost and high performance up to &#1060;180 mm in diameter, showing its feasibility and advancement of the promising configuration of NiFe LDH&#8208;PMo12(+) II Ni@NiFe LDH(&#8722;) for alkaline anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane electrode stack cells. Furthermore, to mathematically evaluate the evolution, a novel empirical formula is proposed for quantitative identification of structure&#8211;activity correlations, which offers an opportunity for first and fast reliability on materials screening.

         <title>Molybdenum Carbide Electrocatalyst In Situ Embedded in Porous Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nanotubes Promotes Rapid Kinetics in Sodium&#8208;Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge&#8208;storage kinetics of a sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal battery are accelerated by incorporating highly redox&#8208;active MoC/Mo2C nanoparticles at the cathode. First&#8208;principle calculations shed fundamental insight on the source of this electrocatalytic enhancement. The resultant Na&#8211;S cells deliver among the most promising rate performance and cycling stabilities in the literature.








Abstract
This is the first report of molybdenum carbide&#8208;based electrocatalyst for sulfur&#8208;based sodium&#8208;metal batteries. MoC/Mo2C is in situ grown on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes in parallel with formation of extensive nanoporosity. Sulfur impregnation (50 wt%&#160;S)&#160;results in unique triphasic architecture termed molybdenum carbide&#8211;porous carbon nanotubes host (MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S). Quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state phase transformation to Na2S is promoted in carbonate electrolyte, with in situ time&#8208;resolved Raman, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and optical analyses demonstrating minimal soluble polysulfides. MoC/Mo2C@PCNT&#8211;S cathodes deliver among the most promising rate performance characteristics in the literature, achieving 987 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1, 818 mAh g&#8722;1 at 3 A g&#8722;1, and 621 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. The cells deliver superior cycling stability, retaining 650 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1.5 A g&#8722;1, corresponding to 0.028% capacity decay per cycle. High mass loading cathodes (64 wt%&#160;S,&#160;12.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) also show cycling stability. Density functional theory demonstrates that formation energy of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on surface of MoC/Mo2C is significantly lowered compared to analogous redox in liquid. Strong binding of Na2Sx (1 &#8804; x&#160;&#8804; 4) on MoC/Mo2C surfaces results from charge transfer between the sulfur and Mo sites on carbides&#8217; surface.

         <title>Optimally&#8208;Tailored Spinodal Architected Materials for Multiscale Design and Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy directly target stiffness and lightweightness in optimal design and indirectly promote biological functions via microscale porosity and randomness. Their functional representation is also exploited for scalable multiscale manufacturing. As an example, a multiscale craniofacial implant is designed to support masticatory forces and microscale porosity is tailored upon manufacturing to promote bone regeneration and repair.








Abstract
Spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. By locally varying the spinodal class, orientation, and porosity during topology optimization, a large portion of the anisotropic material space is exploited such that material is efficiently placed along principal stress trajectories at the microscale. Additionally, the bicontinuous, nonperiodic, unstructured, and stochastic nature of spinodal architected materials promotes mechanical and biological functions not explicitly considered during optimization (e.g., insensitivity to imperfections, fluid transport conduits). Furthermore, in contrast to laminated composites or periodic, structured architected materials (e.g., lattices), the functional representation of spinodal architected materials leads to multiscale, optimized designs with clear physical interpretation that can be manufactured directly, without special treatment at spinodal transitions. Physical models of the optimized, spinodal&#8208;embedded parts are manufactured using a scalable, voxel&#8208;based strategy to communicate with a masked stereolithography (m&#8208;SLA) 3D&#160;printer.

         <title>Coupling Lipid Nanoparticle Structure and Automated Single&#8208;Particle Composition Analysis to Design Phospholipase&#8208;Responsive Nanocarriers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structured lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are characterized using Raman, X&#8208;ray, and neutron scattering to quantify the activity of the enzyme phospholipase D (PLD). Combining single&#8208;particle and bulk analysis for static and dynamic systems enables a label&#8208;free dynamic monitoring of PLD activity in LNPs. This demonstrates that particle structure drives the interaction of lipid nanocarriers with PLD.








Abstract
Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are versatile structures with tunable physicochemical properties that are ideally suited as a platform for vaccine delivery and RNA therapeutics. A key barrier to LNP rational design is the inability to relate composition and structure to intracellular processing and function. Here Single Particle Automated Raman Trapping Analysis (SPARTA) is combined with small&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray and neutron scattering (SAXS/SANS) techniques to link LNP composition with internal structure and morphology and to monitor dynamic LNP&#8211;phospholipase D (PLD) interactions. This analysis demonstrates that PLD, a key intracellular trafficking mediator, can access the entire LNP lipid membrane to generate stable, anionic LNPs. PLD activity on vesicles with matched amounts of enzyme substrate is&#160;an order of magnitude lower, indicating that the LNP lipid membrane structure can be used to control enzyme interactions. This represents an opportunity to design enzyme&#8208;responsive LNP solutions for stimuli&#8208;responsive delivery and diseases where PLD is dysregulated.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Assisted 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; Phase Transformation of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high&#8208;quality and high&#8208;purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large&#8208;scale production of 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs.








Abstract
Phase engineering of nanomaterials (PEN) has demonstrated great potential in the fields of catalysis, electronics, energy storage and conversion, and condensed matter physics. Recently, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with unconventional metastable phases (e.g., 1T and 1T&#8242;) have attracted increasing research interest due to their unique and appealing physicochemical properties. However, there is still a lack of a simple, universal, and controlled method for the preparation of large&#8208;scale and high&#8208;purity unconventional&#8208;phase TMD crystals, restricting their further fundamental study and practical applications. Here, a facile, one&#8208;step salt&#8208;assisted general strategy is reported for the controlled phase transformation of commercially available TMDs with conventional 2H phase, yielding a large amount of metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;phase TMDs, including WS2, WSe2, MoS2, and MoSe2. It is found that the easily accessible metal salts, such as K2C2O4&#183;H2O, K2CO3, Na2CO3, Rb2CO3, Cs2CO3, KHCO3, NaHCO3, and NaC2O4, can be used to assist the 2H&#8208;to&#8208;1T&#8242; phase transformation, greatly simplifying the synthetic process for producing metastable 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMDs. Importantly, this method can also be used to prepare 1T&#8242;&#8208;TMD alloys, such as 1T&#8242;&#8208;WS2xSe2(1&#8722;x). This newly developed strategy is robust and highly effective, which can also be used for the phase engineering of other materials with various polymorphs.

&lt;p&gt;Common metal salts are used to realize the controlled phase transformation of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) from the conventional thermodynamically stable 2H phase to unconventional metastable 1T&#8242; phase. This work not only paves the way to prepare high-quality and high-purity unconventional metastable 1T&#8242;-TMDs for fundamental and practical investigations, but also greatly simplifies the procedure for the large-scale production of 1T&#8242;-TMDs.

         <title>Powering &#8776;50 &#181;m Motion by a Molecular Event in DNA Crystals</title>

A major challenge in material design is to translate molecular events to macroscale properties. In this work, self&#8208;assembled DNA crystals are shown to reversibly expand and contract over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli.








Abstract
A major challenge in material design is to couple nanoscale molecular and supramolecular events into desired chemical, physical, and mechanical properties at the macroscopic scale. Here, a novel self&#8208;assembled DNA crystal actuator is reported, which has reversible, directional expansion and contraction for over 50 &#956;m in response to versatile stimuli, including temperature, ionic strength, pH, and redox potential. The macroscopic actuation is powered by cooperative dissociation or cohesion of thousands of DNA sticky ends at the designed crystal contacts. The increase in crystal porosity and cavity in the expanded state dramatically enhances the crystal capability to accommodate/encapsulate nanoparticles/proteins, while the contraction enables a &#8220;sponge squeezing&#8221; motion for releasing nanoparticles. This crystal actuator is envisioned to be useful for a wide range of applications, including powering self&#8208;propelled robotics, sensing subtle environmental changes, constructing functional hybrid materials, and working in drug controlled&#8208;release systems.

         <title>Catalytic Mechanism of Oxygen Vacancies in Perovskite Oxides for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with the perovskite Sr0.9TiO3&#8722;&#948;, the perovskite Sr0.9Ti0.7Mn0.3O3&#8722;&#948; (STMn0.3) with a higher concentration of oxygen vacancies exhibits superior adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of lithium polysulfides, and improves the utilization of sulfur. The STMn0.3 battery still delivers a superior initial specific capacity of 780&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a decay rate of 0.032% per cycle after 1500&#160;cycles at 2 C, enabling a high&#8208;efficiency lithium&#8211;sulfur battery.








Abstract
Defective materials have been demonstrated to possess adsorptive and catalytic properties in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, which can effectively solve the problems of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) shuttle and sluggish conversion kinetics during charging and discharging of Li&#8211;S batteries. However, there is still a lack of research on the quantitative relationship between the defect concentration and the adsorptive&#8208;catalytic performance of the electrode. In this work, perovskites Sr0.9Ti1&#8722;xMnxO3&#8722;&#948; (STMnx) (x&#160;=&#160;0.1&#8211;0.3) with different oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations are quantitatively regulated as research models. Through a series of tests of the adsorptive property and electrochemical performance, a quantitative relationship between oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentration and adsorptive&#8208;catalytic properties is established. Furthermore, the catalytic mechanism of oxygen vacancies in Li&#8211;S batteries is investigated using density functional theory calculations and in&#160;situ experiments. The increased oxygen vacancies can effectively increase the binding energy between perovskite and LiPSs, reduce the energy barrier of LiPSs decomposition reaction, and promote LiPSs conversion reaction kinetics. Therefore, the perovskite STMn0.3&#160;with high oxygen&#8208;vacancy concentrations exhibits excellent LiPSs adsorptive and catalytic properties, realizing high&#8208;efficiency Li&#8211;S batteries. This work is helpful to realize the application of the quantitative regulation strategy of defect engineering in Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Effective Passivation with Self&#8208;Organized Molecules for Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecules with a planar molecular skeleton exhibit effective defect&#8208;passivation capability for perovskite photovoltaics, contributed by their ordered intermolecular arrangement and well&#8208;matched size with the perovskite lattice. The passivators spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adherent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which enables the best device yield in&#8208;lab efficiency of 25.05%.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have achieved power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) exceeding 25% over the past decade and effective passivation for the interface with high trap density plays a significant role in this process. Here, two organic molecules are studied as passivators, and it is demonstrated that an advantageous molecular geometry and intermolecular ordering, aside from the functional moieties, are of great significance for effective and extensive passivation. Besides, the passivation molecules spontaneously form a uniform passivation network adjacent to the bottom surface of perovskite films during a top&#8208;down crystallization via liquid medium annealing, which greatly reduces defect&#8208;assisted recombination throughout the whole perovskite/SnO2 interface. The champion device yields an in&#8208;lab PCE of 25.05% (certified 24.39%). The investigation provides a more comprehensive understanding of passivation and a new avenue to achieve effective bottom&#8208;interface engineering for perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Space Crystal Structure Analysis by Low&#8208;Dose Focal&#8208;Series TEM Imaging of Organic Materials with Near&#8208;Atomic Resolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) methodology, low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction (LD&#8208;FSR), enables near&#8208;atomic resolution of 1.6 &#197;. This method allows the distinction between co&#8208;existing organic polymorphs, and observation of crystal defects and atoms. Moreover, a new copper phthalocyanine polymorph (&#955;&#8208;CuPc) is identified using LD&#8208;FSR, resulting in real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation.








Abstract
Structural analysis of beam&#8208;sensitive materials by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) represents a significant challenge, as high&#8208;resolution TEM (HRTEM) requires high electron doses that limit its applicability to stable inorganic materials. Beam&#8208;sensitive materials, e.g., organic crystals, must be imaged under low dose conditions, leading to problematic contrast interpretation and loss of fine structural details. Here, HRTEM imaging of organic crystalline materials with near&#8208;atomic resolution of up to 1.6 &#197; is described, which enables real&#8208;space studies of crystal structures, as well as observation of co&#8208;existing polymorphs, crystal defects, and atoms. This is made possible by a low&#8208;dose focal&#8208;series reconstruction methodology, which provides HRTEM images where contrast reflects true object structure and can be performed on contemporary cryo&#8208;EM instruments available to many research institutions. Copper phthalocyanine (CuPc), a perchlorinated analogue of CuPc, and indigo crystalline films are imaged. In the case of indigo crystals, co&#8208;existing polymorphs and individual atoms (carbonyl oxygen) can be observed. In the case of CuPc, several polymorphs are observed, including a new one, for which the crystal structure is found based on direct in&#8208;focus imaging, accomplishing real&#8208;space crystal structure elucidation. Such direct analysis can be transformative for structure studies of organic materials.

         <title>Native Ligand Carbonization Renders Common Platinum Nanoparticles Highly Durable for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction: Annealing Temperature Matters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Native surface ligands (e.g., oleylamine and oleic acid) attached to Pt nanoparticles during synthesis can be directly converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells upon thermal annealing, rendering common Pt particles highly stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. This in situ ligand carbonization strategy is general and can also be applied to improve the stability of commercial Pt/C catalysts.








Abstract
Current protocols for synthesizing monodisperse platinum (Pt) nanoparticles typically involve the use of hydrocarbon molecules as surface&#8208;capping ligands. Using Pt nanoparticles as catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), however, these ligands must be removed to expose surface sites. Here, highly durable ORR catalysts are realized without ligand removal; instead, the native ligands are converted into ultrathin, conformal graphitic shells by simple thermal annealing. Strikingly, the annealing temperature is a critical factor dictating the ORR performance of Pt catalysts. Pt nanoparticles treated at 500&#160;&#176;C show a very poor ORR activity, whereas those annealed at 700&#160;&#176;C become highly active along with exceptional stability. In&#8208;depth characterization reveals that thermal treatment from 500 to 700&#160;&#176;C gradually opens up the porosity in carbon shells through graphitization. Importantly, such graphitic&#8208;shell&#8208;coated Pt catalysts exhibit a superior ORR stability, largely retaining the activity after 20 000 cycles in a membrane electrode assembly. Moreover, this ligand carbonization strategy can be extended to modify commercial Pt/C catalysts with substantially enhanced stability. This work demonstrates the feasibility of boosting the ORR performance of common Pt nanoparticles by harnessing the native surface ligands, offering a robust approach of designing highly durable catalysts for proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.

         <title>Coupling Localized Laser Writing and Nonlocal Recrystallization in Perovskite Crystals for Reversible Multidimensional Optical Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Performing multifield modulation of coupled localized laser writing and nonlocal moisture treatment on metal halide perovskites crystals enables the creation and manipulation of localized photoluminescence for optical encryption from 2D to 3D and 4D, such as reversible encryption&#8211;reading, repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing, and even spatially and temporally resolved reading with high resolution.








Abstract
The ability to generate and manipulate photoluminescence (PL) with high spatial resolution has been of primary importance for applications in micro&#8208;optoelectronics, while the emerging metal halide perovskites offer novel material platforms where diverse photonic functionalities and fine structuring are constantly explored. Herein, micro&#8208;PL patterns consisting of highly luminescent CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (NCs) in nonluminescent perovskite crystals are directly fabricated by focused femtosecond laser irradiation. Further modulation with a moisture field leads to the selective dissolution of the laser&#8208;destabilized perovskite structures as revealed by density functional theory simulations, thus allowing for facile control of the reversible PL from the recrystallization of moisture&#8208;induced CsPbBr3 NCs. By leveraging the coupled laser writing and moisture modulation, multimodal information encryption is realized by reversible encryption&#8211;reading and repeatable erasing&#8211;refreshing. This optical storage mechanism is also extended to 3D and 4D by realizing spatially and temporally resolved optical encryption. The coupled multifield modulation on perovskite crystals can enable potential applications in optical storage and encryption, and offer a novel solution for the creation and manipulation of localized PL structures with high temporal and spatial resolutions.

         <title>Preparation of Amorphous SnO2&#8208;Encapsulated Multiphased Crystalline Cu Heterostructures for Highly Efficient CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three types of Cu@SnO2 nanostructures with hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell architectures are synthesized, in which a series of unconventional phases of Cu (i.e., 2H, 4H, and 6H) is observed. The obtained hemicapsule heterostructures exhibit superior CO2 reduction reaction selectivity toward CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (above 90%) in a wide potential window, outperforming their yolk&#8211;shell and core&#8211;shell counterparts.








Abstract
Controlling the architectures and crystal phases of metal@semiconductor heterostructures is very important for modulating their physicochemical properties and enhancing their application performances. Here, a facile one&#8208;pot wet&#8208;chemical method to synthesize three types of amorphous SnO2&#8208;encapsulated crystalline Cu heterostructures, i.e., hemicapsule, yolk&#8211;shell, and core&#8211;shell nanostructures, in which unconventional crystal phases (e.g., 2H, 4H, and 6H) and defects (e.g., stacking faults and twin boundaries) are observed in the crystalline Cu cores, is reported. The hemicapsule Cu@SnO2 heterostructures, with voids that not only expose the Cu core with unconventional phases but also retain the interface between Cu and SnO2, show an excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) selectivity toward the production of CO and formate with high Faradaic efficiency (FE) above 90% in a wide potential window from &#8722;1.05 to &#8722;1.55&#160;V (vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)), and the highest FE of CO2RR (95.3%) is obtained at &#8722;1.45&#160;V (vs RHE). This work opens up a new way for the synthesis of new heterostructured nanomaterials with promising catalytic application.

         <title>Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2&#8208;bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real&#8208;time self&#8208;healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr2), 14.14% (CsPbI2Br), and 23.37% (FA0.92MA0.08PbI3).








Abstract
Healing charge&#8208;selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art strategies are often static by one&#8208;off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in&#8208;service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low&#8208;melting&#8208;point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbIBr2 solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI2Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA0.92MA0.08PbI3 (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid&#8208;to&#8208;liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration.

     alt="Universal Dynamic Liquid Interface for Healing Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A universal method of creating a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is launched by reinforcing the defective surface and grain boundaries of perovskite film with nonvolatile 2-bromonaphthalene (BN) with a low melting point of 53&#8211;58&#160;&#176;C. Different from static interfaces, the fluid characteristic originating from the easy solid-to-liquid phase conversion of the DHI not only reinforces management of defect passivation and energetics modification, but also enables effective defect real-time self-healing. High efficiencies are thus achieved for popular PSCs up to 12.05% (CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), 14.14% (CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br), and 23.37% (FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Healing charge-selective contact interfaces in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) highly determines the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. However, the state-of-the-art strategies are often static by one-off formation of a functional interlayer, which delivers fixed interfacial properties during the subsequent operation. As a result, defects formed in-service will gradually deteriorate the photovoltaic performances. Herein, a dynamic healing interface (DHI) is presented by incorporating a low-melting-point small molecule onto perovskite film surface for highly efficient and stable PSCs. Arising from the reduced non-radiative recombination, the DHI boosts the PCE to 12.05% for an all-inorganic CsPbIBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; solar cell and 14.14% for a CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Br cell, as well as 23.37% for an FA&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;MA&lt;sub&gt;0.08&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FA = formamidinium, MA = methylammonium) cell. The solid-to-liquid phase conversion of DHI at elevated temperature causes a longitudinal infiltration into the bulk perovskite film to maximize the charge extraction, passivate defects at grain boundaries, and suppress ion migration. Furthermore, the stability is remarkably enhanced under air, heat, and persistent light-irradiation conditions, paving a universal strategy for advanced perovskite-based optoelectronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Structural Phase Transitions between Layered Indium Selenide for Integrated Photonic Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transition between two topologically similar layered structures in In2Se3 breaks the speed and energy limitations of photonic memory, via reversible nonvolatile refractive index change induced by a single nanosecond pulse. In this work, the atomistic phase&#8208;change pathway between the layered structures is unraveled with in situ high&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray diffraction and integrated photonic switching with a transferred epitaxial layer is demonstrated. Detailed analysis on the volumetric effect and by nonlinear spectroscopy are provided to harness the mode coupling and loss in the hybrid device.








Abstract
The primary mechanism of optical memoristive devices relies on phase transitions between amorphous and crystalline states. The slow or energy&#8208;hungry amorphous&#8211;crystalline transitions in optical phase&#8208;change materials are detrimental to the scalability and performance of devices. Leveraging an integrated photonic platform, nonvolatile and reversible switching between two layered structures of indium selenide (In2Se3) triggered by a single nanosecond pulse is demonstrated. The high&#8208;resolution pair distribution function reveals the detailed atomistic transition pathways between the layered structures. With interlayer &#8220;shear glide&#8221; and isosymmetric phase transition, switching between the &#945;&#8208; and &#946;&#8208;structural states contains low re&#8208;configurational entropy, allowing reversible switching between layered structures. Broadband refractive index contrast, optical transparency, and volumetric effect in the crystalline&#8211;crystalline phase transition are experimentally characterized in molecular&#8208;beam&#8208;epitaxy&#8208;grown thin films and compared to ab initio calculations. The nonlinear resonator transmission spectra measure of incremental linear loss rate of 3.3&#160;GHz, introduced by a 1.5&#160;&#181;m&#8208;long In2Se3&#8208;covered layer, resulted from the combinations of material absorption and scattering.

         <title>Dirac Fermion Cloning, Moir&#233; Flat Bands, and Magic Lattice Constants in Epitaxial Monolayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic substrate modulation perturbs the electronic states of graphene, duplicates Dirac cones, and effectively couples the two valleys of the Dirac states in epitaxial monolayer graphene. The intervalley interaction is controlled by the substrate lattice constant. Moir&#233; flat bands emerge at certain magic values of the substrate lattice constant.








Abstract
Tuning interactions between Dirac states in graphene has attracted enormous interest because it can modify the electronic spectrum of the 2D material, enhance electron correlations, and give rise to novel condensed&#8208;matter phases such as superconductors, Mott insulators, Wigner crystals, and quantum anomalous Hall insulators. Previous works predominantly focus on the flat band dispersion of coupled Dirac states from different twisted graphene layers. In this work, a new route to realizing flat band physics in monolayer graphene under a periodic modulation from substrates is proposed. Graphene/SiC heterostructure is taken as a prototypical example and it is demonstrated experimentally that the substrate modulation leads to Dirac fermion cloning and, consequently, the proximity of the two Dirac cones of monolayer graphene in momentum space. Theoretical modeling captures the cloning mechanism of the Dirac states and indicates that moir&#233; flat bands can emerge at certain magic lattice constants of the substrate, specifically when the period of modulation becomes nearly commensurate with the (3&#8201;&#215;&#8201;3)R30o\[(\sqrt 3 \; \times \;\sqrt 3 )R{30^o}\] supercell of graphene. The results show that epitaxial single monolayer graphene on suitable substrates is a promising platform for exploring exotic many&#8208;body quantum phases arising from interactions between Dirac&#160;electrons.&#160;

         <title>Van der Waals Exfoliation Processed Biopiezoelectric Submucosa Ultrathin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) method to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of effective piezoelectric domains is presented. The vdWE method facilitates the detection of piezoelectricity and make the application of piezoelectric biological tissues possible. The vdWE&#8208;processed SIS (small intestinal submucosa) ultrathin film reaches the thickness of 100 nm and exhibits enhanced piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric biomaterials have attracted significant attention due to the potential effect of piezoelectricity on biological tissues and their versatile applications. However, the high cost and complexity of assembling and domain aligning biomolecules at a large scale, and the disordered arrangement of piezoelectric domains as well as the lack of ferroelectricity in natural biological tissues remain a roadblock toward practical applications. Here, utilizing the weak van der Waals interaction in the layered structure of small intestinal submucosa (SIS), a van der Waals exfoliation (vdWE) process is reported to fabricate ultrathin films down to the thickness of the effective piezoelectric domain. Based on that, the piezoelectric property is revealed of SIS stemming from the collagen fibril, with piezoelectric coefficients up to 4.1 pm V&#8722;1 and in&#8208;plane polarization orientation parallel to the fibril axis. Furthermore, a biosensor based on the vdWE&#8208;processed SIS film with an in&#8208;plane electrode is demonstrated that produces open&#8208;circuit voltages of &#8776;250&#160;mV under the cantilever vibration condition. The vdWE method shows great potential in facilely fabricating ultrathin films of soft tissues and biosensors.

         <title>Strain Modulation for Light&#8208;Stable n&#8211;i&#8211;p Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strain modulation strategy to constrain phase segregation in a wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber by reinforcing the energy barrier for ion migration is reported. With compressive strain, the single&#8208;junction devices yield one of smallest voltage deficits of 440 mV. Moreover, the resulting perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells achieve a champion efficiency of 26.95% with improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising to penetrate photovoltaic market. However, the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorbers used in top&#8208;cell often suffer severe phase segregation under illumination, which restricts the operation lifetime of tandem solar cells. Here, a strain modulation strategy to fabricate light&#8208;stable perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells is reported. By employing adenosine triphosphate, the residual tensile strain in the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite absorber is successfully converted to compressive strain, which mitigates light&#8208;induced ion migration and phase segregation. Based on the wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite with compressive strain, single&#8208;junction solar cells with the n&#8211;i&#8211;p layout yield a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.53% with the smallest voltage deficits of 440&#160;mV. These cells also maintain 83.60% of initial PCE after 2500 h operation at the maximum power point. Finally, these top cells are integrated with silicon bottom cells in a monolithic tandem device, which achieves a PCE of 26.95% and improved light stability at open&#8208;circuit.

         <title>Studying Complex Evolution of Hyperelastic Materials under External Field Stimuli using Artificial Neural Networks with Spatiotemporal Features in a Small&#8208;Scale Dataset</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonlinear mechanical properties of hyperelastic materials can be viewed as responses of materials to external serial stimuli. A convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory (CBLSTM) model with spatiotemporal features is used to capture the complex evolution of structures and properties of materials under external field stimuli and to design materials with excellent performance via taking full advantage of data information even in a small&#8208;scale dataset.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;learning (DL) methods, in consideration of their excellence in dealing with highly complex structure&#8211;performance relationships for materials, are expected to become a new design paradigm for breakthroughs in material performance. However, in most cases, it is impractical to collect massive&#8208;scale experimental data or open&#8208;source theoretical databases to support training DL models with sufficient prediction accuracy. In a dataset consisting of 483 porous silicone rubber observations generated via ink&#8208;writing additive manufacturing, this work demonstrates that constructing low&#8208;dimensional, accurate descriptors is the prerequisite for obtaining high&#8208;precision DL models based on small experimental datasets. On this basis, a unique convolutional bidirectional long short&#8208;term memory model with spatiotemporal features extraction capability is designed, whose hierarchical learning mechanism further reduces the requirement for the amount of data by taking full advantage of data information. The proposed approach can be expected as a powerful tool for innovative material design on small experimental datasets, which can also be used to explore the evolutionary mechanisms of the structures and properties of materials under complex working conditions.

         <title>Identification of the Stable Pt Single Sites in the Environment of Ions: From Mechanism to Design Principle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two kinds of Pt sites, Ptzn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 and Ptads&#8208;S2 are identified on Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS), and interesting phenomena are observed and analyzed, facing the Brownian collision of ions in the photocatalytic hydrogen evolution process, which further inspires the design of novel composite with enhanced activity.








Abstract
For single&#8208;atom (SA)&#8208;based catalysis, it is urgent to understand the nature and dynamic evolution of SA active sites during the reactions. In this work, an example of Pt SA&#8208;Zn0.5Cd0.5S (Pt SA&#8208;ZCS) is found to display interesting phenomena when facing the Brownian collision of ions in aqueous photocatalysis. Via synchrotron radiation, surface techniques, microscopy, and theory calculations, the results show that two kinds of Pt sites exist: PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 (Pt substituting the Zn site) and Ptads&#8208;S2 (Pt adsorbing on the surface). In Na2S, the S2&#8722; can coordinate with Pt atoms and peel them from the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites, but leaves more stable PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites, bringing a low but stable catalytic activity (19.40&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1). Meanwhile, in ascorbic acid, the ascorbic acid ions show less complex ability with Pt atoms, but can decrease the migration barrier of Ptads&#8208;S2 sites (67.18 down to 35.96&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 52.03% drop after 6 h). Therefore, the Ptads&#8208;S2 sites gradually aggregate into nanoclusters, bringing a high but decayed catalytic activity. Moreover, a Pt SA&#8208;ZCS&#8208;Sulfur composite is designed mainly covered by PtZn&#8208;sub&#8208;S3 sites accordingly (max: 79.09&#160;mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, 5% drop after 6 h and QE: 14.0% at 420&#160;nm), showing a beneficial strategy &#8220;from mechanism to design principle.&#8221;

         <title>Magnetic&#8208;Powered Janus Cell Robots Loaded with Oncolytic Adenovirus for Active and Targeted Virotherapy of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Janus oncolytic adenovirus&#8208;loaded 293T cell robots with full coating of targeted peptides and Janus modification of magnetic nanoparticles are capable of controllable magnetic propulsion and tumor&#8208;specific binding and killing. Such active medical platform with enhanced tissue retention and penetration shows the highest therapeutic efficacy in treating orthoptic mice bladder cancer models with minimized damage to normal tissues.








Abstract
A unique robotic medical platform is designed by utilizing cell robots as the active &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; of oncolytic adenovirus (OA), capable of tumor&#8208;selective binding and killing. The OA&#8208;loaded cell robots are fabricated by entirely modifying OA&#8208;infected 293T cells with cyclic arginine&#8211;glycine&#8211;aspartic acid tripeptide (cRGD) to specifically bind with bladder cancer cells, followed by asymmetric immobilization of Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) on the cell surface. OA can replicate in host cells and induce cytolysis to release the virus progeny to the surrounding tumor sites for sustainable infection and oncolysis. The asymmetric coating of magnetic NPs bestows the cell robots with effective movement in various media and wireless manipulation with directional migration in a microfluidic device and bladder mold under magnetic control, further enabling steerable movement and prolonged retention of cell robots in the mouse bladder. The biorecognition of cRGD and robust, controllable propulsion of cell robots work synergistically to greatly enhance their tissue penetration and anticancer efficacy in the 3D cancer spheroid and orthotopic mouse bladder tumor model. Overall, this study integrates cell&#8208;based microrobots with virotherapy to generate an attractive robotic system with tumor specificity, expanding the operation scope of cell robots in biomedical community.

         <title>Stable Universal 1&#8208; and 2&#8208;Input Single&#8208;Molecule Logic Gates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;molecule logic devices are ideal candidates for ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements to perform high&#8208;density computing. Gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au single&#8208;electron transistors not only hold the advantage of controlling molecular orbitals (MOs) via bias and gate voltages, but also exhibit a unique electronic structure with two adjacent MOs. This provides a single&#8208;electron logic calculator to implement all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.








Abstract
Controllable single&#8208;molecule logic operations will enable development of reliable ultra&#8208;minimalistic circuit elements for high&#8208;density computing but require stable currents from multiple orthogonal inputs in molecular junctions. Utilizing the two unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals (MOs) of gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au (Fc = ferrocene) single&#8208;electron transistors (&#8776;2&#160;nm), a stable single&#8208;electron logic calculator (SELC) is presented, which allows real&#8208;time modulation of output current as a function of orthogonal input bias (Vb) and gate (Vg) voltages. Reliable and low&#8208;voltage (&#448;Vb&#448; &#8804; 80&#160;mV, &#448;Vg&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron&#8208;transport calculations. Stable multi&#8208;logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1&#8208;input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2&#8208;input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.

&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;&#448; &#8804; 2&#160;V) operations of the SELC depend upon the unambiguous association of current resonances with energy shifts of the MOs (which show an invariable, small energy separation of &#8776;100 meV) in response to the changes of voltages, which is confirmed by electron-transport calculations. Stable multi-logic operations based on the SELC modulated current conversions between the two resonances and Coulomb blockade regimes are demonstrated via the implementation of all universal 1-input (YES/NOT/PASS_1/PASS_0) and 2-input (AND/XOR/OR/NAND/NOR/INT/XNOR) logic gates.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Implanting an Electron Donor to Enlarge the d&#8211;p Hybridization of High&#8208;Entropy (Oxy)hydroxide: A Novel Design to Boost Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel quantitative d&#8211;p hybridization theory is proposed to effectively illustrate the catalytic activity of each metal site in a high&#8208;entropy (HE) system, providing a guideline for the design/fabrication of advanced HE catalysts. Accordingly, a new way of introducing electron donors to construct catalysts with reinforced activity is raised and verified. The corresponding Ag&#8208;decorated HE Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide electrocatalyst exhibits excellent electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy (HE) electrocatalysts are becoming a research hotspot due to their interesting &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; and have great potential for tailored catalytic properties. However, it is still a great challenge to illustrate their inherent catalytic mechanism for the &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221;, and there is also a paucity of quantitative descriptors to characterize the specific catalytic activity and give logical design strategies for HE systems. Herein, the unexpected activation of all metal sites in HE Cu&#8211;Co&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxides for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is reported, and it is found that metal&#8211;oxygen d&#8211;p hybridization, as an effective descriptor, can indicate the intrinsic activity of each metal site. According to the quantitative hybridization, introducing an electron donor (e.g., Ag) is raised and verified to reinforce the electrocatalytic activity of the HE system. Consequently, Ag&#8208;decorated Co&#8211;Cu&#8211;Fe&#8211;Ag&#8211;Mo (oxy)hydroxide (Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH) electrocatalysts are constructed by an electrochemical reconstruction method, and their OER performances are thoroughly characterized. The Ag@CoCuFeAgMoOOH is verified with a low overpotential (270&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a small Tafel slope (35.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), as well as good electrochemical stability. The favorable activity of the electron donor and underlying synergistic &#8220;cocktail effect&#8221; are demonstrated and disclosed. This work opens up a new strategy to guide the design/fabrication of advanced HE electrocatalysts.

         <title>Steric Engineering Enables Efficient and Photostable Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient and photostable wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) with only 25&#160;mol% bromide are enabled by steric engineering via alloying dimethylammonium and chloride. The WBG single&#8208;junction cells, with a high efficiency of 17.7%, exhibit promising operational stability under 1&#8208;sun illumination (T90 of 1045 h). This strategy enables all&#8208;perovskite tandem with an impressive stabilized efficiency of 26.0%.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG, &#8776;1.8&#160;eV) perovskite is a crucial component to pair with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskite in low&#8208;cost monolithic all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. However, the stability and efficiency of WBG perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are constrained by the light&#8208;induced halide segregation and by the large photovoltage deficit. Here, a steric engineering to obtain high&#8208;quality and photostable WBG perovskites (&#8776;1.8&#160;eV) suitable for all&#8208;perovskite tandems is reported. By alloying dimethylammonium and chloride into the mixed&#8208;cation mixed&#8208;halide perovskites, wide bandgaps are obtained with much lower bromide contents while the lattice strain and trap densities are simultaneously minimized. The WBG PSCs exhibit considerably improved performance and photostability, retaining &gt;90%&#160;of their initial efficiencies after 1000 h of operation at maximum power point. With the triple&#8208;cation/triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskites enabled by steric engineering, a stabilized power conversion efficiency of 26.0% in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells is further obtained. The strategy provides an avenue to fabricate efficient and stable WBG subcells for multijunction photovoltaic devices.

         <title>A Multitasking Flexible Sensor via Reservoir Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitasking, flexible sensor sheet for monitoring of weather information via a flexible resistive sensor and reservoir computing is reported. This sensor and reservoir computing combination enables the device to estimate water droplet volume and wind velocity with a small training dataset. An important advance is to realize multiple parameter detection simultaneously using only one flexible sensor.








Abstract
Natural disasters are reported globally, and one source of severe damage to cities is flooding caused by locally heavy rain. Sharing of local weather information can save lives. However, it is difficult to collect local weather information in real&#8208;time because such data collection requires bulky, expensive sensors. For local, real&#8208;time monitoring of heavy rain and wind, a sensor system should be simple and low&#8208;cost so that it can be attached to a variety of surfaces, including roofs, vehicles, and umbrellas. To develop simple, low&#8208;cost multitasking sensors located on nonplanar surfaces, a flexible rain sensor to monitor waterdrop volume and wind velocity is devised. To monitor both simultaneously, a laser&#8208;induced graphene&#8208;based superhydrophobic conductive film is introduced. Using the superhydrophobic surface, water dynamics are measured when waterdrops collide with the sensor surface, and obtained time&#8208;series data are processed using &#8220;reservoir computing&#8221; to extract the volume and velocity from a single sensor as multitasking electronics. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, it is shown that the sensor measures continuous, long&#8208;term volume and wind&#8208;change dynamics. The results demonstrate feasibility of multitasking electronics with reservoir computing to reduce sensor integration complexity with low power consumption for both sensor and signal processing.

         <title>Transition Metal Carbo&#8208;Chalcogenide &#8220;TMCC:&#8221; A New Family of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) can be considered an atomic&#8208;level combination of TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Realized by electrochemical&#8208;assisted delamination, Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C are the first examples of TMCCs to be delaminated into single layers. These newly developed 2D TMCCs are 50% stronger than TMDC counterparts and have a wide range of applications.








Abstract
Here, a new family of 2D transition metal carbo&#8208;chalcogenides (TMCCs) is reported, which can be considered a combination of two well&#8208;known families, TM carbides (MXenes) and TM dichalcogenides (TMDCs), at the atomic level. Single sheets are successfully obtained from multilayered Nb2S2C and Ta2S2C using electrochemical lithiation followed by sonication in water. The parent multilayered TMCCs are synthesized using a simple, scalable solid&#8208;state synthesis followed by a topochemical reaction. Superconductivity transition is observed at 7.55 K for Nb2S2C. The delaminated Nb2S2C outperforms both multilayered Nb2S2C and delaminated NbS2 as an electrode material for Li&#8208;ion batteries. Ab initio calculations predict the elastic constant of TMCC to be over 50% higher than that of TMDC.

         <title>In&#8208;Memory Computing using Memristor Arrays with Ultrathin 2D PdSeOx/PdSe2 Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure is demonstrated using controllable ultraviolet&#8211;ozone treatment. By confining the formation of conductive filaments in the heterostructure, the memristor achieves a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. The crossbar array further enables multiple convolutional image processing with a high image&#8208;recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4%.








Abstract
In&#8208;memory computing based on memristor arrays holds promise to address the speed and energy issues of the classical von Neumann computing system. However, the stochasticity of ions&#8217; transport in conventional oxide&#8208;based memristors imposes severe intrinsic variability, which compromises learning accuracy and hinders the implementation of neural network hardware accelerators. Here, these challenges are addressed using a low&#8208;voltage memristor array based on an ultrathin PdSeOx/PdSe2 heterostructure switching medium realized by a controllable ultraviolet (UV)&#8211;ozone treatment. A distinctively different ions&#8217; transport mechanism is revealed in the heterostructure that can confine the formation of conductive filaments, leading to a remarkable uniform switching with low set and reset voltage variability values of 4.8% and &#8722;3.6%, respectively. Moreover, convolutional image processing is further implemented using various crossbar kernels that achieve a high recognition accuracy of &#8776;93.4% due to the highly linear and symmetric analog weight update as well as multiple conductance states, manifesting its potential beyond von Neumann computing.

         <title>Nanostructured Metallic Glass in a Highly Upgraded Energy State Contributing to Efficient Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P nanostructured metallic glass (NG) is located in an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes its catalytic performance. Modified Ni&#8211;P NG displays the best urea oxidation reaction (UOR) performance of Ni&#8208;based alloys, with a low potential of 1.36 V @ 10 mA cm&#8211;2, and a Tafel slope of 13 mV dec&#8722;1.








Abstract
Metallic glasses (MGs), with high density of low coordination sites and high Gibbs free energy state, are novel promising and competitive candidates in the family of electrochemical catalysts. However, it remains a grand challenge to modify the properties of MGs by control of the disordered atomic structure. Recently, nanostructured metallic glasses (NGs), consisting of amorphous nanometer&#8208;sized grains connected by amorphous interfaces, have been reported to exhibit tunable properties compared to the MGs with identical chemical composition. Here, it is demonstrated that electrodeposited Ni&#8211;P NG is characterized by an extremely high energy state due to its heterogeneous structure, which significantly promotes the catalytic performance. Moreover, the Ni&#8211;P NG with a heterogeneous structure is a perfect precursor for the fabrication of unique honey&#8208;like nanoporous structure, which displays superior catalytic performance in the urea oxidation reaction (UOR). Specifically, modified Ni&#8211;P NG requires a potential of mere 1.36&#160;V at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, with a Tafel slope of 13&#160;mV dec&#8211;1, which is the best UOR performance in Ni&#8208;based alloys. The present work demonstrates that the nanostructurization of MGs provides a universal and effective pathway to upgrade the energy state of MGs for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts in energy conversion.

         <title>Defective Fe Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Enhance Metabolic Profiling for High&#8208;Accuracy Diagnosis of Human Cancers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is developed as the matrix for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry for the acquisition of serum metabolic fingerprints. Fe&#8208;MOF&#8208;UL with favorable charge transfer and mitigated thermal dissipation achieves &#8776;10&#160;000&#8208;fold signal enhancement and leads to high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis of three major cancers, promising a universal detection tool for human cancers.








Abstract
Cancers heavily threaten human life; therefore, a high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis is vital to protect human beings from the suffering of cancers. While biopsies and imaging methods are widely used as current technologies for cancer diagnosis, a new detection platform by metabolic analysis is expected due to the significant advantages of fast, simple, and cost&#8208;effectiveness with high body tolerance. However, the signal of molecule biomarkers is too weak to acquire high&#8208;accuracy diagnosis. Herein, precisely engineered metal&#8211;organic frameworks for laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry, allowing favorable charge transfer within the molecule&#8211;substrate interface and mitigated thermal dissipation by adjusting the phonon scattering with metal nodes, are developed. Consequently, a surprising signal enhancement of &#8776;10 000&#8208;fold is achieved, resulting in diagnosis of three major cancers (liver/lung/kidney cancer) with area&#8208;under&#8208;the&#8208;curve of 0.908&#8211;0.964 and accuracy of 83.2%&#8211;90.6%, which promises a universal detection tool for large&#8208;scale clinical diagnosis of human cancers.

         <title>Single&#8208;Junction Organic Solar Cells with 19.17% Efficiency Enabled by Introducing One Asymmetric Guest Acceptor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ternary system is developed by introducing an asymmetric electron acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the PM1:L8&#8208;BO host system. The ternary system exhibits a record&#8208;high efficiency of 19.17% and demonstrates better long&#8208;term stability compared to the host system.








Abstract
The ternary strategy has been widely identified as an effective approach to obtain high&#8208;efficiency organic solar cells (OSCs). However, for most ternary OSCs, the nonradiative voltage loss lies between those of the two binary devices, which limits further efficiency improvements. Herein, an asymmetric guest acceptor BTP&#8208;2F2Cl is designed and incorporated into a PM1:L8&#8208;BO host blend. Compared with the L8&#8208;BO neat film, the L8&#8208;BO:BTP&#8208;2F2Cl blend film shows higher photoluminescence quantum yield and larger exciton diffusion length. Introducing BTP&#8208;2F2Cl into the host blend extends its absorption spectrum, improves the molecular packing of host materials, and suppresses the nonradiative charge recombination of the ternary OSCs. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency is improved up to 19.17% (certified value 18.7%), which represents the highest efficiency value reported for single&#8208;junction OSCs so far. The results show that improving the exciton behaviors is a promising approach to reducing the nonradiative voltage loss and realizing high&#8208;performance OSCs.

Given the increasing interest in searching for high&#8208;quality low&#8208;cost passivating contacts for c&#8208;Si solar cells, the fundamentals and development status of wide&#8208;bandgap metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions in developing highly transparent passivating contacts with excellent carrier selectivity are discussed. Based on in&#8208;depth data analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies for metal&#8208;compound&#8208;based passivating contacts design and device integration are pointed out.








Abstract
Advanced doped&#8208;silicon&#8208;layer&#8208;based passivating contacts have boosted the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) solar cells to over 26%. However, the inevitable parasitic light absorption of the doped silicon layers impedes further PCE improvement. To this end, alternative passivating contacts based on wide&#8208;bandgap metal compounds (so&#8208;called dopant&#8208;free passivating contacts (DFPCs)) have attracted great attention, thanks to their potential merits in terms of parasitic absorption loss, ease&#8208;of&#8208;deposition, and cost. Intensive research activity has surrounded this topic with significant progress made in recent years. Various electron&#8208;selective and hole&#8208;selective contacts based on metal compounds have been successfully developed, and a champion PCE of 23.5% has been achieved for a c&#8208;Si solar cell with a MoOx&#8208;based hole&#8208;selective contact. In this work, the fundamentals and development status of DFPCs are reviewed and the challenges and potential solutions for enhancing the carrier selectivity of DFPCs are discussed. Based on comprehensive and in&#8208;depth analysis and simulations, the improvement strategies and future prospects for DFPCs design and device implementation are pointed out. By tuning the carrier concentration of the metal compound and the work function of the capping transparent electrode, high PCEs over 26% can be achieved for c&#8208;Si solar cells with DFPCs.

         <title>Simultaneous Electrochemical Exfoliation and Covalent Functionalization of MoS2 Membrane for Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through exfoliation of the electrochemically lithium&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in iodoacetamide water solution, the covalent functionalization of single&#8208;layer MoS2 with iodoacetamide molecules can be shortened to 15 min, and functionalized MoS2 membranes are fabricated via vacuum filtration. Under reverse osmosis mode, the functionalized MoS2 membranes exhibit rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes and NaCl, respectively.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide membranes exhibit good antiswelling properties but poor water desalination property. Here, a one&#8208;step covalent functionalization of MoS2 nanosheets for membrane fabrication is reported, which is accomplished by simultaneous exfoliating and grafting the lithium&#8208;ion&#8208;intercalated MoS2 in organic iodide water solution. The lithium intercalation amount in MoS2 is optimized so that the quality of the produced 2D nanosheets is improved with homogeneous size distribution. The lamellar MoS2 membranes are tested in reverse osmosis (RO), and the functionalized MoS2 membrane exhibits rejection rates of &gt;90% and &gt;80% for various dyes (Rhodamine B, Crystal Violet, Acid Fuchsin, Methyl Orange, and Evans Blue) and NaCl, respectively. The excellent ion&#8208;sieving performance and good water permeability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes are attributed to the suitable channel widths that are tuned by iodoacetamide. Furthermore, the stability of the functionalized MoS2 membranes in NaCl and dye solutions is also confirmed by RO tests. Molecular dynamics simulation shows that water molecules tend to form a single layer between the amide&#8208;functionalized MoS2 layers but a double layer between the ethanol&#8208;functionalized MoS2 (MoS2&#8208;ethanol) layers, which indicates that a less packed structure of water between the MoS2&#8208;ethanol layers leads to lower hydrodynamic resistance and higher permeation.

         <title>Nontrivial Doping Evolution of Electronic Properties in Ising&#8208;Superconducting Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates the feasibility of synthesizing stable aliovalent alloys of transition metal dichalcogenide materials in the single&#8208;layer limit throughout the entire alloy composition range. Furthermore, an experimental and theoretical atomic&#8208;scale characterization of the evolution of the electronic ground state (both the electronic structure and collective electronic phases) of a 2D Ising superconductor (single&#8208;layer NbSe2) with structural disorder is reported.








Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides offer unprecedented versatility to engineer 2D materials with tailored properties to explore novel structural and electronic phase transitions. In this work, the atomic&#8208;scale evolution of the electronic ground state of a monolayer of Nb1&#8722;&#948;Mo&#948;Se2 across the entire alloy composition range (0 &lt; &#948;&#160;&lt; 1) is investigated using low&#8208;temperature (300 mK) scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS). In particular, the atomic and electronic structure of this 2D alloy throughout the metal to semiconductor transition (monolayer NbSe2 to MoSe2) is studied. The measurements enable extraction of the effective doping of Mo atoms, the bandgap evolution and the band shifts, which are monotonic with &#948;. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that collective electronic phases (charge density wave and superconductivity) are remarkably robust against disorder and further shown that the superconducting TC changes non&#8208;monotonically with doping. This contrasting behavior in the normal and superconducting state is explained using first&#8208;principles calculations. Mo doping is shown to decrease the density of states at the Fermi level and the magnitude of pair&#8208;breaking spin fluctuations as a function of Mo content. These results paint a detailed picture of the electronic structure evolution in 2D TMD alloys, which is of utmost relevance for future 2D materials design.

Flexible Sensors
In article number 2201663, Kohei Nakajima, Kuniharu Takei, and co&#8208;workers propose a multitasking flexible sensor realized by using reservoir computing analysis to estimate rain&#8208;droplet volume and wind flow for future weathercasting. Surface morphology and conditions of the sensor are investigated to detect continuous water&#8208;droplet conductivity precisely, and an optimized reservoir computing algorithm is applied for water&#8208;volume and wind&#8208;flow estimations using a single sensor.

Catalytic Active Sites
In article number 2201328, Guowei Li, B. Andrei Bernevig, Claudia Felser, and co&#8208;workers propose a descriptor to predicate the position of catalytic active sites fast and precisely. By a simple checking of the space group and the position of obstructed surface states for the given obstructed insulators, high&#8208;performance catalysts can be predicated.

Spinodal Architected Materials
In article number 2109304, Glaucio H. Paulino and co&#8208;workers report spinodal architected materials with tunable anisotropy to unify optimal design and manufacturing of multiscale structures. Mechanical anisotropy and porosity are spatially tailored to directly target mechanical function (e.g., stiffness) and indirectly promote biological function (e.g., fluid transport conduits). Applications to medical (e.g., prosthetics) and mechanical components are demonstrated.

Single&#8208;Molecule Devices
In article number 2202135, Zong&#8208;Liang Li, Christian A. Nijhuis, Enrique Del Barco, and co&#8208;workers report a single&#8208;electron logic calculator formed by a gated Au/S&#8208;(CH2)3&#8208;Fc&#8208;(CH2)9&#8208;S/Au transistor. The unique adjacent conductive molecular orbitals in the Fc moiety are controlled by the orthogonal bias and gate voltages, resulting in the implementation of all universal logic gates within a single&#8208;molecule device.

This integration constructs engineered living hydrogels with the capability of performing tasks associated with living microbes such as self&#8208;replication, self&#8208;adaption, and environmental responsiveness.








Abstract
Living biological systems, ranging from single cells to whole organisms, can sense, process information, and actuate in response to changing environmental conditions. Inspired by living biological systems, engineered living cells and nonliving matrices are brought together, which gives rise to the technology of engineered living materials. By designing the functionalities of living cells and the structures of nonliving matrices, engineered living materials can be created to detect variability in the surrounding environment and to adjust their functions accordingly, thereby enabling applications in health monitoring, disease treatment, and environmental remediation. Hydrogels, a class of soft, wet, and biocompatible materials, have been widely used as matrices for engineered living cells, leading to the nascent field of engineered living hydrogels. Here, the interactions between hydrogel matrices and engineered living cells are described, focusing on how hydrogels influence cell behaviors and how cells affect hydrogel properties. The interactions between engineered living hydrogels and their environments, and how these interactions enable versatile applications, are also discussed. Finally, current challenges facing the field of engineered living hydrogels for their applications in clinical and environmental settings are highlighted.

         <title>Thermoplasmonics in Solar Energy Conversion: Materials, Nanostructured Designs, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on recent developments of thermoplasmonics in the solar energy field. The physics fundamentals behind thermoplasmonics are elaborated, basic strategies of material and nanostructured designs toward more efficient photothermal conversion are summarized. Then, recent advances are reviewed for targeted applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaics. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.








Abstract
The indispensable requirement for sustainable development of human society has forced almost all countries to seek highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective ways to harvest and convert solar energy. Though continuous progress has advanced, it remains a daunting challenge to achieve full&#8208;spectrum solar absorption and maximize the conversion efficiency of sunlight. Recently, thermoplasmonics has emerged as a promising solution, which involves several beneficial effects including enhanced light absorption and scattering, generation and relaxation of hot carriers, as well as localized/collective heating, offering tremendous opportunities for optimized energy conversion. Besides, all these functionalities can be tailored via elaborated designs of materials and nanostructures. Here, first the fundamental physics governing thermoplasmonics is presented and then the strategies for both material selection and nanostructured designs toward more efficient energy conversion are summarized. Based on this, recent progress in thermoplasmonic applications including solar evaporation, photothermal chemistry, and thermophotovoltaic is reviewed. Finally, the corresponding challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Recent Structural Engineering of Polymer Semiconductors Incorporating Hydrogen Bonds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydrogen bonds can enhance the planarity and rigidity of polymer semiconductors via noncovalent interactions, improve the charge transport, and offer polymers unique superiority of mechanical flexibility. This review describes the recent structural evolution of polymer semiconductors containing hydrogen bonds and the effect of hydrogen bonds on carrier mobility, self&#8208;healing, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties.








Abstract
Highly planar, extended &#960;&#8208;electron organic conjugated polymers have been increasingly attractive for achieving high&#8208;mobility organic semiconductors. In addition to the conventional strategy to construct rigid backbone by covalent bonds, hydrogen bond has been employed extensively to increase the planarity and rigidity of polymer via intramolecular noncovalent interactions. This review provides a general summary of high&#8208;mobility semiconducting polymers incorporating hydrogen bonds in field&#8208;effect transistors over recent years. The structural engineering of the hydrogen bond&#8208;containing building blocks and the discussion of theoretical simulation, microstructural characterization, and device performance are covered. Additionally, the effects of the introduction of hydrogen bond on self&#8208;healing, stretchability, chemical sensitivity, and mechanical properties are also discussed. The review aims to help and inspire design of new high&#8208;mobility conjugated polymers with superiority of mechanical flexibility by incorporation of hydrogen bond for the application in flexible electronics.

         <title>Are Liquid Metals Bulk Conductors?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 26, July 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the wide variety of electromechanical responses of liquid metal stretchable electronics reported in the literature are reviewed. Complementing this review with&#160;our&#160;own measurements, the relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that of a bulk conductor. Then, possible explanations for the discrepancies are dicussed and suggestions are provided on experimental design for future research.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics have potential in wide&#8208;reaching applications including wearables, personal health monitoring, and soft robotics. Many recent advances in stretchable electronics leverage liquid metals, particularly eutectic gallium&#8208;indium (EGaIn). A variety of EGaIn electromechanical behaviors have been reported, ranging from bulk conductor responses to effectively strain&#8208;insensitive responses. However, numerous measurement techniques have been used throughout the literature, making it difficult to directly compare the various proposed formulations. Here, the electromechanical responses of EGaIn found in the literature is reviewed and pure EGaIn is investigated using three electrical resistance measurement techniques: four point probe, two point probe, and Wheatstone bridge. The results indicate substantial differences in measured electromechanical behavior between the three methods, which can largely be accounted for by correcting for a fixed offset corresponding to the resistances of various parts of the measurement circuits. Yet, even accounting for several of these sources of experimental error, the average relative change in resistance of EGaIn is found to be lower than that predicted by the commonly used bulk conductor assumption, referred to as Pouillet's law. Building upon recent theories proposed in the literature, possible explanations for the discrepancies are discussed. Finally, suggestions are provided on experimental design to enable reproducible and interpretable research.

         <title>Tuning the Magnetization of Manganese (II) Carbonate by Intracrystalline Amino Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Incorporation of organic molecules into the lattice of inorganic crystalline hosts is a common phenomenon in biomineralization, and has been shown to alter various properties of the crystalline host. Taking this phenomenon as our source of inspiration, we show herein that incorporation of specific single amino acids into the lattice of manganese (II) carbonate strongly alters its inherent magnetic properties. At room temperature, the magnetic susceptibility of the amino&#8208;acid&#8208;incorporating paramagnetic MnCO3 decreases, following a simple rule of mixtures. When cooled below the N&#233;el temperature, however, the opposite trend is observed, namely an increase in magnetic susceptibility measured in a high magnetic field. Such an increase, accompanied by a drastic change in the N&#233;el phase transformation temperature, results from a decrease in MnCO3 orbital overlapping and the weakening of superexchange interactions. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the magnetic properties of a host crystal have been tuned via the incorporation of amino acids.

         <title>2D Ultrathin Nanopatterned Interlayer to Suppress Lithium Dendrite Growth in High&#8208;Energy Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We report a novel strategy for robust and ultrathin (&lt; 1 &#181;m) multi&#8208;layered protective structures to address uncontrolled Li dendrite growth at Li&#8208;metal battery anodes. Synergetic interaction among Ag nanoparticles (Ag NPs), reduced graphene oxide (rGO) films, and self&#8208;assembled block&#8208;copolymer (BCP) layers enables effective suppression of dendritic Li growth. While Ag NP layer confines the growth of Li metal underneath rGO layer, BCP layer facilitates the fast and uniformly distributed flux of Li&#8208;ion transport and mechanically supports the rGO layer. Notably, highly aligned nanochannels with &#8764;15&#160;nm diameter and &#8764;600&#160;nm length scale interpenetrating within BCP layer offer reversible well&#8208;defined pathways for Li&#8208;ion transport. Dramatic stress relaxation with the multilayered structure is confirmed via structural simulation considering the mechanical stress induced by filamentary&#8208;growth of Li metal. Li metal anodes modified with the protective layer well&#8208;maintain stable reaction interfaces with limited SEI formation, yielding outstanding cycling stability and enhanced rate capability, as demonstrated by the full&#8208;cells paired with high&#8208;loading of LiFePO4 cathodes. Our idealized design of multi&#8208;layer protective layer provides significant insight for advanced Li metal anodes.

         <title>Seawater Corrosion Resistant and Isotropic Zero Thermal Expansion (Zr, Ta)(Fe, Co)2 Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zero thermal expansion (ZTE) alloy as a dimensionally stable material is usually challenged by harsh environmental erosion, since ZTE and corrosion resistance are generally mutually exclusive. Here, we report a high&#8208;performance alloy, Zr0.8Ta0.2Fe1.7Co0.3, that shows (i) isotropic ZTE behavior (&#945;l = 0.21(2) &#215; 10&#8722;6 K&#8722;1) in a wide temperature range of 5 &#8211; 360 K, (ii) high corrosion resistance in the seawater&#8208;like solution compared with classic Invar and stainless Invar, and (iii) excellent cyclic thermal and structural stabilities. Such stabilities are attributed to the cubic symmetry, the controllable magnetic order, and the spontaneously formed passive film with Ta and Zr chemical modifications. The results are evidenced by X&#8208;ray/neutron diffractions, microscopy, spectroscopy, and electrochemistry investigations. Such multiple stabilities have the potential to broaden the robust applications of ZTE alloys, especially in marine services.

         <title>Convection Driven Ultra&#8208;Rapid Protein Detection Via Nanobody&#8208;Functionalized Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Conventional biosensors rely on the diffusion&#8208;dominated transport of the target analyte to the sensor surface. Consequently, they require an incubation step that may take several hours to allow for the capture of analyte molecules by sensor biorecognition sites. This incubation step is a primary cause of long sample&#8208;to&#8208;result times. Here, we integrate alternating current electrothermal flow (ACET) in an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT)&#8208;based sensor to accelerate the device operation. The ACET is applied to the gate electrode functionalized with nanobody&#8208;SpyCatcher fusion proteins. Using the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2) spike protein in human saliva as an example target, we show that ACET enables protein recognition within only 2 minutes of sample exposure, supporting its use in clinical practice. The ACET integrated sensor exhibits better selectivity, higher sensitivity, and lower limit of detection than the equivalent sensor with diffusion dominated operation. We compare the performance of ACET integrated sensors with two types of organic semiconductors in the channel and investigate grounds for device&#8208;to&#8208;device variations. Our results provide guidelines for the channel material choice in OECT based biochemical sensors, and demonstrate that ACET integration substantially decreases the detection speed while increasing the sensitivity and selectivity of transistor&#8208;based sensors.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Responsive Magnetoactive and Electro&#8208;Ionic Soft Actuator Derived from Nickel&#8208;based Metal&#8208;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
There is growing demand for multi&#8208;responsive soft actuators for the realization of natural, safe, and complex motions in robotic interactions. In particular, soft actuators simultaneously stimulated by electrical and magnetic fields have always been a under development owing to their simple controllability and reliability during operation. Herein, we report magnetically and electrically driven dual&#8208;responsive soft actuators (MESA) derived from novel nickel&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic frameworks (Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C). Nanoscale Ni&#8208;MOFs&#8208;700C has excellent electrochemical and magnetic properties that allow it to be used as a multifunctional material under both magneto&#8208;active and electro&#8208;ionic actuations. The dual&#8208;responsive MESA exhibits a bending displacement of 30&#160;mm and an ultrafast rising time of 1.5 s under a very low input voltage of 1&#160;V, and also exerts a bending deflection of 12.5&#160;mm at 50 mT under a high excitation frequency of 5&#160;Hz. By utilizing a dual&#8208;responsive MESA, the hovering motion of a hummingbird robot was demonstrated under magnetic and electrical stimuli.

         <title>Organic Hole Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hole transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8208;i&#8208;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8208;i&#8208;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy levels, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability and overall low cost. In this review, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules and self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs), as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole transport properties, energy levels and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook towards highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

Abstract
Noncovalent macrocycle&#8208;confined supramolecular purely organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) is the current research hotspot. Herein, we report a high&#8208;efficiency noncovalent polymerization activated near&#8208;infrared (NIR) emissive RTP&#8208;harvesting system in aqueous solution based on the stepwise confinement of cucurbit[7]uril (CB[7]) and &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin grafted hyaluronic acid (HACD). Compared with dodecyl chain bridged 6&#8208;bromoisoquinoline derivative (G), the dumbbell&#8208;shaped assembly G&#8834;CB[7] presents an appeared complexation&#8208;induced RTP signal at 540&#160;nm via the first confinement of CB[7]. Subsequently, benefitting from the stepwise confinement encapsulation of &#946;&#8208;cyclodextrin cavity, the subsequent noncovalent polymerization of the binary G&#8834;CB[7] assembly enabled by HACD can contribute to the further enhanced RTP emission intensity approximately 8 times in addition to an increased lifetime from 59.0 &#181;s to 0.581&#160;ms. Moreover, upon doping a small amount of two types of organic dyes, Nile blue (NiB) or Tetrakis(4&#8208;sulfophenyl)porphyrin (TPPSS) as an acceptor into the supramolecular confinement assembly G&#8834;CB[7]@HACD, efficient RTP energy transfer occurs accompanied by a long&#8208;lived NIR emitting performance (680, 710&#160;nm) with a high donor/acceptor ratio. Intriguingly, the prepared RTP&#8208;harvesting system is successfully applied for targeted NIR imaging of living tumor cells by utilizing the targeting ability of hyaluronic acid, which provides a new strategy to create advanced water&#8208;soluble NIR phosphorescent materials.

         <title>Instantaneous High&#8208;Resolution Visual Imaging of Latent Fingerprints in Water Using Color&#8208;Tunable AIE Pincer Complexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Instant visualization of latent fingerprints was developed by using a series of water&#8208;soluble terpyridine zinc complexes as aggregation&#8208;induced emission probes in pure water, under UV light or ambient sunlight. By simply soaking, or spraying with an aqueous solution of the probe, bright yellow fluorescence images with high contrast and resolution were readily developed on various surfaces including tinfoil, glass, paper, steel, leather and ceramic tile. Remarkably, latent fingerprints can be visualized within seconds including details of whorl and sweat pores. The color of emission could be tuned from blue to orange by modifying the pincer ligands, allowing direct imaging under sunlight. These inexpensive, water&#8208;resistant, and color&#8208;tunable probes provide a practical approach for latent fingerprints recording and analysis, security protection, as well as criminal investigation in different scenarios.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultrastable Silicon Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built from a bottom&#8208;up polymer design strategy for Si anodes. The in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) with uniform structure and flexible mechanical property enhances the stability of the electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface.








Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, a layered conductive polyaniline (LCP) coating is built on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of the SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8776;3&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1. This work demonstrates the great potential of regulating the SEI properties by a layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8211;Sb Nanoplates with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel&#8208;Cell Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate of ordered rhombohedral Pd8Sb3 phase with a Pd&#8208;terminated surface is successfully prepared and applied as a high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalyst. The unique surface structure can effectively reduce the energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation in the ethanol oxidation reaction&#160;and suppress the competing two&#8208;electron pathway in the oxygen reduction reaction, leading to high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysis for energy conversion and beyond.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells, but it is still formidably challenging. In this work, a novel Pd&#8211;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions is prepared. Detailed characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs). The Pd8Sb3 HPs exhibit&#160;much enhanced activity toward the oxidation of various alcohols. Particularly, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and 4.5&#160;A&#160;mgPd&#8722;1 toward the EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In situ electrochemical attenuated total reflectance surface&#8208;enhanced infrared absorption spectroscopy (ATR&#8208;SEIRAS) measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of the EOR. As revealed by density functional theory calculations, the high EOR activity of the Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. Additionally, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C also shows superior performance in the&#160;ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of the Pd&#8211;Sb nanostructure, giving huge impetus for the design&#160;of high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Atomic and Electronic Manipulation of Robust Ferroelectric Polymorphs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
True 2D ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K is achieved via atomic and electronic manipulation of polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2, developing an original phase diagram for ferroelectricity in atomically thin materials.








Abstract
Polymorphism allows the symmetry of the lattice and spatial charge distributions of atomically thin materials to be designed. While various polymorphs for superconducting, magnetic, and topological states have been extensively studied, polymorphic control is a challenge for robust ferroelectricity in atomically thin geometries. Here, the atomic and electric manipulation of ferroelectric polymorphs in Mo1&#8722;xWxTe2 is reported. Atomic manipulation for polymorphic control via chemical pressure (substituting tungsten for molybdenum atoms) and charge density modulation can realize tunable polar lattice structures and robust ferroelectricity up to T&#160;= 400 K with a constant coercive field in an atomically thin material. Owing to the effective inversion symmetry breaking, the ferroelectric switching withstands a charge carrier density of up to 1.1 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2, developing an original diagram for ferroelectric switching in atomically thin materials.

         <title>Vapor Lubrication for Reducing Water and Ice Adhesion on Polydimethylsiloxane Brushes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fast removal of small water drops from surfaces is a challenging issue in heat transfer, water collection or anti&#8208;icing. Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes show good prospects to reach this goal because of their low adhesion to liquids. To further reduce adhesion of water drops, here, we expose the surface to the vapor of organic solvents such as toluene or n&#8208;hexane. In the presence of such vapors, water drops slide at lower tilt angle and move faster. It is mainly caused by the physisorption of vapor and swelling of the PDMS brushes, which serves as a lubricating layer. Enhanced by the toluene vapor lubrication, the limit departure volume of water drop on PDMS brushes decreases by one order of magnitude compared to that in air. As a result, the water harvesting efficiency in toluene vapor increased by 65%. We further demonstrate benefits of vapor lubrication in drop manipulation and de&#8208;icing via the gravity of ice itself.

         <title>Kirigami Inspired Pressure Sensors for Wearable Dynamic Cardiovascular Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuously and accurately monitoring the pulse wave signals is critical to prevent and diagnose cardiovascular diseases. However, existing wearable pulse sensors are vulnerable to motion artifacts due to the lack of proper adhesion and conformal interface with human skin during body movement. Here, a highly sensitive and conformal pressure sensor inspired by the kirigami structure was developed to measure the human pulse wave on different body artery sites under various prestressing pressure conditions and even with body movement. COMSOL multi&#8208;physical field coupling simulation and experimental testing were used to verify the unique advantages of the kirigami structure. The device shows a superior sensitivity (35.2&#160;mV/Pa) and remarkable stability (&gt;84,000 cycles). Towards practical applications, a wireless cardiovascular monitoring system is developed for wirelessly transmitting the pulse signals to a mobile phone in real&#8208;time, which successfully distinguished the pulse waveforms from different participants. The pulse waveforms measured by the kirigami inspired pressure sensor are as accurate as those provided by the commercial medical device. Given the compelling features, the sensor provides an ascendant way for wearable electronics to overcome motion artifacts when monitoring pulse signals, thus representing a solid advancement towards personalized healthcare in the era of the Internet of Things.

         <title>Efficient low&#8208;grade heat conversion and storage with an activity&#8208;regulated redox flow cell via thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Efficient and cost&#8208;effective technologies are highly desired to convert the tremendous amount of low&#8208;grade waste heat to electricity. Although thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC) has attracted increasing attention recently, the unsatisfactory thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical conversion efficiency and low power density limit its practical applications. In this work, we demonstrate a thermosensitive Nernstian&#8208;potential&#8208;driven strategy in TREC system to boost its temperature coefficient, power density and thermoelectric conversion efficiency by rationally regulating the activities of redox couples at different temperatures. With Zn anode and [Fe(CN)6]4&#8208;/3&#8211;&#8208;guanidinium as catholyte, the TREC flow cell presents an unprecedented average temperature coefficient of &#8208;3.28&#160;mV/K, and has achieved an absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 25.1% and apparent thermoelectric efficiency of 14.9% relative to Carnot efficiency at the temperature range of 25&#8211;50&#160;&#176;C at 1&#160;mA/cm2. In addition, a thermoelectric power density of 1.98&#160;mW/(m2 K2) has been demonstrated, which is more than 7 times the highest power density of reported TREC systems. This activity regulation strategy could inspire research into high&#8208;efficiency and high&#8208;power TREC devices for practical low&#8208;grade heat harnessing.

         <title>Fast Near&#8208;Infrared Photodetection using III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for IR light detection due to their tunable bandgap and their solution processing; however, to date, the time response of CQD IR photodiodes has been inferior to that provided by Si and InGaAs. We reasoned that the high permittivity of II&#8208;VI CQDs leads to slow charge extraction due to screening and capacitance; whereas III&#8208;Vs &#8211; if their surface chemistry could be mastered &#8211; offer a low permittivity and thus increased potential for high&#8208;speed operation. In initial studies, we found that the covalent character in InAs leads to imbalanced charge transport, the result of unpassivated surfaces and uncontrolled heavy doping. We report surface management using amphoteric ligand coordination and find that the approach addresses simultaneously the In and As surface dangling bonds. The new InAs CQD solids combine high mobility (0.04 cm2 V&#8208;1 s&#8208;1) with a 4x reduction in permittivity compared to PbS CQDs. The resulting photodiodes achieve a response time faster than 2&#160;ns &#8211; the fastest photodiode among previously&#8208;reported CQD photodiodes &#8211; combined with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 30% at 940&#160;nm.

         <title>Theory&#8208;Driven Design of Cationic Accelerator for High&#8208;Performance Electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aqueous electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries are considered as one of the most promising energy storage devices for their cost effectiveness, high output voltage and safety, but their electrochemical performance is limited by the sluggish electrolysis kinetics of cathode MnO2/Mn2+ and anode Zn/Zn2+ reactions. To overcome this critical challenge, herein a cationic accelerator (CA) strategy is proposed based on the prediction of first&#8208;principles calculations. We utilize polyvinylpyrrolidone as a model CA to testify the rational design of the CA strategy. It manifests that the CA effectively facilitates rapid cations migration in electrolyte and adequate charge transfer at electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, benefiting the deposition/dissolution processes of both Mn2+ and Zn2+ cations to simultaneously improve kinetics of cathodic MnO2/Mn2+ and anodic Zn/Zn2+ reactions and thereby enabling high&#8208;performance MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries. The resulting MnO2&#8208;Zn battery regulated by CA exhibits large reversible capacities of 455 mAh g&#8211;1 and 3.64 mAh cm&#8211;2 at 20 C with energy density retention of 90%, a high discharge voltage of 1.95&#160;V at 1 C, as well as a long lifespan of 2000 cycles, achieving one of the best overall performances in the electrolytic MnO2&#8208;Zn batteries. Our comprehensive work integrating theoretical prediction with experimental studies provides opportunities to the development of high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

Supercritical relaxor nanograined ferroelectrics are demonstrated for high&#8208;performance dielectric capacitors, showing record&#8208;high overall properties of energy density &#8764;13.1 J cm&#8211;3 and field&#8208;insensitive efficiency &#8764;90% at &#8764;74&#160;kV mm&#8211;1 and superior charge&#8208;discharge performances of high power density &#8764;700 MW cm&#8211;3, high discharge energy density &#8764;6.67 J cm&#8211;3 and ultra&#8208;short discharge time &lt;40&#160;ns at 55&#160;kV mm&#8211;1. Ex&#8208;/In&#8208;situ transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction provide clear evidence of the supercritical behavior in (Na,K)(Sb,Nb)O3&#8208;SrZrO3&#8208;(Bi0.5Na0.5)ZrO3 ceramics, being achieved by engineering the coexistence of multiple local symmetries within the ergodic relaxor zone. The vanished difference between the ground relaxor state and the high&#8208;field supercritical state eliminates the polarization hysteresis. The supercritical evolution with electric field enables a highly&#8208;delayed polarization saturation with continuously&#8208;increased polarization magnitudes. The results demonstrate that such a design strategy of compositionally&#8208;induced and field&#8208;manipulated supercritical behavior can be generalizable for developing desirable energy&#8208;storage dielectrics for applications in ceramic/film capacitors.

         <title>Synergistic Crystallization and Passivation by A Single Molecular Additive for High Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
With its power conversion efficiency surpassed those of all other thin film solar cells only a few years after its invention, the perovskite solar cell has become a superstar. Controlling intermediate phase of crystallization is a key to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films. Herein, a single molecule additive, N, N&#8208;Dimethylimidodicarbonimidic diamide hydroiodide (DIAI), is incorporated into perovskite precursor to eliminate the influence of intermediate phases. By taking advantage of interaction of DIAI and DMSO, the intermediate phase FAI&#8208;PbI2&#8208;DMSO complex is eliminated, and &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 is entirely converted to desired &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 during the crystallization step, resulting in enlarged grain size and im proved crystalline quality. This is the first observation in solution method that FAPbI3 can be obtained without intermediate phase for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, DIAI is effective at passivating surface defects, resulting in reduced defect density, increased carrier lifetime, and improved device efficiency and stability. The champion device achieved an efficiency of 24.13%. Furthermore, the bare device without any encapsulation maintains 94.1% of its initial efficiency after ambient exposure over 1000 hours. This work contributes a strategy of synergistic crystallization and passivation to directly form &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 from the precursor solution without the influence of intermediate impurities for high performance perovskite applications.

         <title>Versatile Sequential Casting Processing for Highly Efficient and Stable Binary Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Forming an ideal bulk heterojunction (BHJ) morphology is a critical issue governing the photon to electron process in organic solar cells (OSCs). Complementary to the widely&#8208;used blend casting (BC) method for BHJ construction, the sequential casting (SC) can also enable similar or even better morphology and device performance for OSCs. Here we utilize BC and SC methods on three representative donor:acceptor (D:A) blends, i.e., PM6:PC71BM, PM6:IT&#8208;4F and PM6:L8&#8208;BO. We achieve higher power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in all cases by taking advantage of beneficial morphology from SC processing, and a champion PCE of 18.86% (certified as 18.44%) based on PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend is reached, representing the record value among binary OSCs. The observations on phase separation and vertical distribution inspire the proposal of the swelling&#8208;intercalation phase&#8208;separation model to interpret the morphology evolution during the SC processing. Further, we find the vertical phase segregation delivers the improvement of device performance via affecting the charge transport and collection processes, as evidenced by the D:A ratio dependent photovoltaic properties. Besides, OSCs based on SC processing show advantages on device photostability and up&#8208;scale fabrication. This work demonstrates the versatility and efficacy of SC method for BHJ&#8208;based OSCs.

         <title>Enzyme&#8208;Inspired Microenvironment Engineering of a Single&#8208;Molecular Heterojunction for Promoting Concerted Electrochemical CO2 Reduction</title>

Abstract
Challenges remain in the development of novel multifunctional electrocatalysts and their industrial operation on low&#8208;electricity pair&#8208;electrocatalysis platforms for carbon cycle. Herein, we&#160;design and develop an enzyme&#8208;inspired single&#8208;molecular heterojunction electrocatalyst ((NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs) with specific atomic nickel centers and amino&#8208;rich local microenvironments for industrial&#8208;level electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (eCO2RR) and further energy&#8208;saving integrated CO2 electrolysis. Verily, (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs exhibits unprecedented catalytic performance with industry&#8208;compatible current densities, &#8764;100% Faradaic efficiency and remarkable stability for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion, outperforming most reported catalysts. In addition to the enhanced CO2 capture by chemisorption, sturdy deuterium kinetic isotope effect and proton inventory studies sufficiently decipher that such distinctive local microenvironments provide an effective proton ferry effect for improving local alkalinity and proton transfer and creating local interactions to stabilize the intermediate, ultimately enabling the high&#8208;efficiency operation of eCO2RR. Further, by using (NHx)16&#8208;NiPc/CNTs as a bifunctional electrocatalyst in a flow cell, a low&#8208;electricity overall CO2 electrolysis system coupling cathodic eCO2RR with anodic oxidation reaction is developed to achieve concurrent feed gas production and sulfur recovery, simultaneously decreasing the energy input. This work paves the new way in exploring molecular electrocatalysts and electrolysis systems with techno&#8208;economic feasibility.
