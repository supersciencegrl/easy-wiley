         <title>Single Quantum Dot Selection and Tailor&#8208;Made Photonic Device Integration using a Nanoscale&#8208;Focus Pinspot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot technique reveals a new paradigm for a deterministic integration between quantum emitters and photonic structures. The technique can reduce the luminescent quantum dot density from the high&#8208;density quantum dots (QDs)&#160;without destroying their pristine structures, so that individual QD characterization and tailor&#8208;made photonic structure integration can be done deterministically.








Abstract
Among the diverse platforms of quantum light sources, epitaxially grown semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are one of the most attractive workhorses for realizing quantum photonic technologies owing to their outstanding brightness and scalability. However, the spatial and spectral randomness of most QDs severely hinders the construction of large&#8208;scale photonic platforms. In this work, a methodology is presented to deterministically integrate single QDs with tailor&#8208;made photonic structures. A nondestructive luminescence picking method termed as nanoscale&#8208;focus pinspot (NFP) is applied using helium&#8208;ion microscopy to reduce the luminous QD density while retaining the surrounding medium. A single QD emission is only extracted out of the high&#8208;density ensemble QDs. Then the tailor&#8208;made photonic structure of a circular Bragg reflector (CBR) is designed and deterministically integrated with the selected QD. Given that the microscopy can image with nanoscale resolution and apply NFP in situ, photonic devices can be deterministically fabricated on target QDs. The extraction efficiency of the NFP&#8208;selected QD emission is improved by 25 times after the CBR integration. Since the NFP method only controls the luminescence without destroying the medium, it is applicable to various photonic structures such as photonic waveguides or photonic crystal cavities regardless of materials.

         <title>Interfacial Regulation for 3D Printing based on Slice&#8208;Based Photopolymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in slice&#8208;based 3D printing has boomed the rapid development of advanced manufacturing fields worldwide for scientific research and commercial communities. This review discusses the scientific impetus for improving the printing process and the printing details of slice&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing technology from the point of view of the involved interfaces and corresponding interfacial adhesions.








Abstract
3D printing, also known as additive manufacturing, can turn computer&#8208;aided designs into delicate structures directly and on demand by eliminating expensive molds, dies, or lithographic masks. Among the various technical forms, light&#8208;based 3D printing mainly involved the control of polymer&#8208;based matter fabrication and realized a field of manufacturing with high tunability of printing format, speed, and precision. Emerging slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D&#8208;printing methods have prosperously advanced in recent years but still present challenges to the versatility of printing continuity, printing process, and printing details control. Herein, the field of slice&#8208; and light&#8208;based 3D printing is discussed and summarized from the view of interfacial regulation strategies to improve the printing continuity, printing process control, and the character of printed results, and several potential strategies to construct complex 3D structures of distinct characteristics with extra external fields, which are favorable for the further improvement and development of 3D printing, are proposed.

         <title>Topological Spin Textures in a Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnet System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer via tuning the magnitude of the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Besides, the temperature&#8208;induced novel transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K is also observed in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. This may stimulate the discovery of new topological spin textures in antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Topologically protected magnetic &#8220;whirls&#8221; such as skyrmions in antiferromagnetic materials have recently attracted extensive interest due to their nontrivial band topology and potential application in antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions in natural metallic antiferromagnetic materials with merit of probable convenient electrical manipulation have not been reported. Here, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are realized in a non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet, Mn3Sn, capped with a Pt overlayer. The evolution of spin textures from coplanar inverted triangular structures to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions is achieved via tuning the magnitude of interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. Beyond that, the temperature can induce an unconventional transition from skyrmions to antiferromagnetic meron&#8208;like spin textures at &#8776;220 K in the Mn3Sn/Pt samples. Combining with the theoretical calculations, it is found that the transition originates from the temperature dependence of antiferromagnetic exchange interaction between kagome sublayers within the Mn3Sn crystalline unit&#8208;cell. These findings open the avenue for the development of topological spin&#8208;swirling&#8208;based antiferromagnetic spintronics.

         <title>Multifunctional Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite Microcrystalline Engineering and Electromagnetic Response Switching Multi&#8208;Band Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile one&#8208;step solution processing method is developed to rapidly prepare gram&#8208;scale MAPbX3&#160;microcrystals. Utilizing its intrinsic electromagnetic (EM) properties, a series of EM devices is designed and fabricated, which can be applied in the fields of ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filters and multi&#8208;band photodetection covering X&#8208;rays, UV, visible light, and microwaves.








Abstract
High&#8208;efficiency electromagnetic (EM) functional materials are the core building block of high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices, and they are indispensable in various fields ranging from industrial manufacture to daily life, or even from national defense security to space exploration. Searching for high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials and realizing high&#8208;performance EM devices remain&#160;great challenges. Herein, a simple solution&#8208;process is developed to rapidly grow gram&#8208;scale organic&#8211;inorganic (MAPbX3, X&#160;=&#160;Cl, Br, I) perovskite microcrystals. They exhibit excellent EM response in multi bands covering microwaves, visible light, and X&#8208;rays. Among them, outstanding microwave absorption performance with multiple absorption bands can be achieved, and their intrinsic EM properties can be tuned by adjusting polar group. An ultra&#8208;wideband bandpass filter with high suppression level of &#8722;71.8&#160;dB in the stopband in the GHz band, self&#8208;powered photodetectors with tunable broadband or narrowband photoresponse in the visible&#8208;light band, and a self&#8208;powered X&#8208;ray detector with high sensitivity of 3560&#160;&#181;C&#160;Gyair&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;in the X&#8208;ray band are designed and realized by precisely regulating the physical features of perovskite and designing a novel planar device structure. These findings open a door toward developing high&#8208;efficiency EM functional materials for realizing high&#8208;performance EM absorbers and devices.

         <title>A New Zinc Salt Chemistry for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new aqueous Zn salt with an anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide C12H10N(SO2)2&#8722;,&#160;(BBI&#8722;) is designed and synthesized. The 1 m Zn(BBI)2 electrolyte decreases the decomposition activity of H2O molecules, suppresses the&#160;hydrogen evolution reaction, enables compact and uniform zinc deposition, and improves the cycling and calendar stabilities of aqueous Zn batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here, a new zinc salt design and a drop&#8208;in solution for long cycle&#8208;life aqueous ZIBs are reported. The salt Zn(BBI)2 with a rationally designed anion group, N&#8208;(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&#8722;), has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high&#8208;yield and low&#8208;cost method. It is shown that 1&#160;m Zn(BBI)2 aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H2O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using a&#160;zinc&#8208;metal electrode.

&lt;p&gt;A new aqueous Zn salt with an anion group, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;N(SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;2&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;,&#160;(BBI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) is designed and synthesized. The 1 &lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; Zn(BBI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte decreases the decomposition activity of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, suppresses the&#160;hydrogen evolution reaction, enables compact and uniform zinc deposition, and improves the cycling and calendar stabilities of aqueous Zn batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising energy storage solutions with low cost and superior safety, but they suffer from chemical and electrochemical degradations closely related to the electrolyte. Here, a new zinc salt design and a drop-in solution for long cycle-life aqueous ZIBs are reported. The salt Zn(BBI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with a rationally designed anion group, &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-(benzenesulfonyl)benzenesulfonamide (BBI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;), has a special amphiphilic molecular structure, which combines the benefits of hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups to properly tune the solubility and interfacial condition. This new zinc salt does not contain fluorine and is synthesized via a high-yield and low-cost method. It is shown that 1&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt; Zn(BBI)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; aqueous electrolyte with a widened cathodic stability window effectively stabilizes Zn metal/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O interface, mitigates chemical and electrochemical degradations, and enables both symmetric and full cells using a&#160;zinc-metal electrode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toughening Double&#8208;Network Hydrogels by Polyelectrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The employment of the Hoffmeister effect to toughen double&#8208;network hydrogels and broadly tune the mechanical properties using polyelectrolytes is reported. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can inhibit hernia formation and accelerate the healing of abdominal wall defects in vivo.








Abstract
The Hoffmeister effect of inorganic salts is verified as a promising way to toughen hydrogels, however, the high concentration of inorganic salts may be accompanied by poor biocompatibility. In this work, it is found that polyelectrolytes can obviously elevate the mechanical performances of hydrogels through the Hoffmeister effect. The introduction of anionic poly(sodium acrylate) into poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel induces the aggregation and crystallization of the PVA to boost the mechanical properties of the resulting double&#8208;network hydrogel: elevation of 73, 64, 28, 135, and 19 times in the tensile strength, compressive strength, Young's modulus, toughness, and fracture energy compared with poly(acrylic acid), respectively. It is noteworthy that the mechanical performances of the hydrogels can be flexibly tuned by the variation of polyelectrolyte concentration, ionization degree, relative hydrophobicity of the ionic component, and polyelectrolyte type in a wide range. This strategy is verified to work for other Hoffmeister&#8208;effect&#8208;sensitive polymers and polyelectrolytes. Also, the introduction of urea bonds into the polyelectrolyte can further improve the mechanical properties and antiswelling capability of hydrogels. As a biomedical patch, the advanced hydrogel can efficiently inhibit hernia formation and promote the regeneration of soft tissues in an abdominal wall defect model.

         <title>A Protophilic MOF Enables Ni&#8208;Rich Lithium&#8208;Battery Stable Cycling in a High Water/Acid Content</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) that combines ultrahigh surface areas and ionic pore environments is used to selectively and effectively adsorb protic impurities from battery electrolytes, realizing high water/acid tolerant&#160;batteries. Even if H2O is introduced into the batteries and generates hydrofluoric acid (HF), such MOF&#8208;based batteries with a high&#8208;nickel cathode still show high cycling performance.








Abstract
Trace protic impurities, such as water and hydrofluoric acid (HF), can severely degrade the stable and long cycling of lithium batteries. Therefore, the costly water removal process is inevitably needed throughout production of lithium batteries, leaving the paradox that energy&#8208;saving lithium&#8208;battery technology consumes non&#8208;negligible amounts of energy. Herein, a unique ionic metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is reported that enables highly destructive H2O/HF&#8208;tolerant lithium batteries. The isolated ionic fluorine sites in the MOF exhibit unusual protophilicity and efficiently capture ppm&#8208;levels H2O/HF from the highly polar electrolyte solvents. The resulting MOF&#8208;based LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2&#9474;Li battery achieves over 300 cycles in the presence of 800&#160;ppm H2O or 1107&#160;ppm acidic impurity. This tenfold longer battery lifespan relative to those for batteries with conventional standard separators demonstrates its excellent electrochemical cycling performance. The results reveal that the rational use of unique nanoporous features of MOFs can provide new possibilities for long&#8208;standing challenges in the lithium&#8208;battery industry.

         <title>Amorphous MXene Opens New Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The proposed synthesis methods of amorphous MXene are discussed. The unique structure of amorphous MXenes may possess unexpected properties. The work opens new perspectives on the possibility of MXene amorphization, and their energy conversion, energy storage, and other applications.








Abstract
Recently, novel amorphous nanomaterials formed by introducing atomic irregular arrangement factors have been successfully fabricated, showing superior performance in catalysis, energy storage, and mechanics. Among them, 2D&#160;amorphous nanomaterials are the stars, as they combine the benefits of both 2D structure and amorphous. Up to now, many research studies have been published on the study of 2D amorphous materials. However, as one of the most important parts of 2D materials, the research on MXenes mainly focuses on the crystalline counterpart, while the study of highly disordered forms is much less. This work will provide insight into the possibility of MXenes amorphization, and discusses the application prospect of amorphous MXenes materials.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Confined NiFe Dual Atoms within MoS2 Electrocatalyst for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Confining dual atoms (DAs) within the van der Waals gap of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials is expected to expedite the kinetic and energetic strength in catalytic process, yet is a huge challenge in atomic&#8208;scale precise assembling DAs within two adjacent layers in the 2D limit. Here, an ingenious approach is proposed to assemble DAs of Ni and Fe into the interlayer of MoS2. While inheriting the exceptional merits of diatomic species, this interlayer&#8208;confined structure arms itself with confinement effect, displaying the more favorable adsorption strength on the confined metal active center and higher catalytic activity towards acidic water splitting, as verified by intensive research efforts of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Moreover, the interlayer&#8208;confined structure also renders metal DAs a protective shelter to survive in harsh acidic environment. Our findings embodied the confinement effects at the atom level, and interlayer&#8208;confined assembling of multiple species highlights a general pathway to advance interlayer&#8208;confined DAs catalysts within various 2D materials.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Enables Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Quasi&#8208;Monocrystalline Film for High&#8208;Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X&#8208;ray attenuation coefficient. However, the large&#8208;area perovskite fabrication for high performance X&#8208;ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with hot&#8208;pressing method is proposed to prepare large&#8208;area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline thick film of a mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3. The rapid ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large&#8208;area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot&#8208;pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film. After the hot&#8208;pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product increased about 13&#8208;fold (from 1.8 cm2 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 to 23.5 cm2 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&#8722;6 cm2 V&#8722;1 to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1) respectively. As a result, a high&#8208;performance MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 quasi&#8208;monocrystalline X&#8208;ray detector was achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 106 &#956;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low detection limit (37.4 nGyair s&#8722;1), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization and hot&#8208;pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.

However, the large-area perovskite fabrication for high performance X-ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound-assisted crystallization combined with hot-pressing method is proposed to prepare large-area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high-quality quasi-monocrystalline thick film of a mixed-cation perovskite MA&lt;sub&gt;0.42&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The rapid ultrasound-assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large-area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot-pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi-monocrystalline film. After the hot-pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility-lifetime product increased about 13-fold (from 1.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 23.5 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;6&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 1.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) respectively. As a result, a high-performance MA&lt;sub&gt;0.42&lt;/sub&gt;FA&lt;sub&gt;0.58&lt;/sub&gt;PbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; quasi-monocrystalline X-ray detector was achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; &#956;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low detection limit (37.4 nGy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound-assisted crystallization and hot-pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Ion Tunnel Matrix Initiated Oriented Attachment for Highly Utilized Zn Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metallic zinc is an ideal anode for aqueous energy storage, however, Zn anodes suffer from nonhomogeneous deposition, low reversibility and dendrite formation; these lead to an over&#8208;provision of zinc metal in full cells. Herein, we report oriented&#8208;attachment&#8208;regulated Zn stacking initiated through a trapping&#8208;then&#8208;planting process with a high zinc utilization rate (ZUR). Due to the isometric topology features of cubic&#8208;type Prussian blue analogue (PBA), the initial Zn plating occurs at specific sites with equal spacing of &#8764;5 &#197; in the direction perpendicular to the substrate; the trace amount of zinc ions trapped in tunnel matrix provides nuclei for the oriented attachment of Zn (002) deposits. As results, the PBA&#8208;decorated substrate delivers high reversibility of dendrite&#8208;free zinc plating/stripping for more than 6600 cycles (1320&#160;h) and achieves an average Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 99.5% at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with 100% ZUR. Moreover, the anode&#8208;limited full cell with a low negative&#8208;positive electrode ratio (N/P) of 1.2 can be operated stably for 360 cycles, displaying an energy density of 214&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1; this greatly exceeds commercial aqueous batteries. This work provides a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept design of metal anodes with high utilization ratio and a practical method for developing high energy density batteries.

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Function Using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controversy over the artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but there are still open for piracy. Here, w e propose a platform for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable function (PUF), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is nature&#8208;born, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows the entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal (LC) phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>Ionic accumulation as a diagnostic tool in perovskite solar cells: characterising band alignment with rapid voltage pulses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Despite record&#8208;breaking devices, interfaces in perovskite solar cells are still poorly understood, inhibiting further progress. The mixed ionic&#8208;electronic nature of lead&#8208;halide perovskites results in compositional variations at the interfaces, depending on the history of externally applied biases. This makes it difficult to measure critical parameters accurately, for example, the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers. As a result, the field often resorts to a lengthy trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process to optimise these interfaces. While techniques to measure interfacial energy level alignment exist, they are typically carried out in a vacuum and on incomplete cells, hence values may not reflect those found in complete device stacks. To address this, w e have developed a pulsed measurement technique that can characterise the electrostatic potential energy drop across the perovskite layer in a functioning device. O ur method reconstructs the JV curve for a range of stabilisation biases which hold the ion distribution &#8220;static&#8221; during subsequent rapid voltage pulses. W e observe two different regimes: at low applied biases, the reconstructed JV curve is &#8220;s&#8208;shaped&#8221;, whereas, at high applied biases, typical diode&#8208;shaped curves are returned. Using drift&#8208;diffusion simulations, w e demonstrate that the intersection of the two regimes changes based on the band offsets at the transport layer interfaces. This approach effectively allows measurements of interfacial energy level alignment in a complete device under illumination and without the need for expensive vacuum equipment.

         <title>Porosity as a Design Element for Developing Catalytic Molecular Materials for Electrochemical and Photochemical Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The catalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) using sustainable energy inputs is a promising strategy for upcycling of atmospheric carbon into value&#8208;added chemical products. This goal has inspired the development of catalysts for selective and efficient CO2 conversion using electrochemical and photochemical methods. Among the diverse array of catalyst systems designed for this purpose, two&#8208; and three&#8208;dimensional platforms that feature porosity offer the potential to combine carbon capture and conversion. Included are covalent organic frameworks (COFs), metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), porous molecular cages, and other hybrid molecular materials developed to increase active site exposure, stability, and water compatibility while maintaining precise molecular tunability. This mini&#8208;review showcases catalysts for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) that incorporate well&#8208;defined molecular elements integrated into porous materials structures. Selected examples provide insights into how different approaches to this overall design strategy can augment their electrocatalytic and/or photocatalytic CO2 reduction activity.

         <title>Intramolecular&#8208;Catalyzed Vitrimers with White&#8208;Light Emission for Light&#8208;Emitting Diode Encapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new concept of intramolecular&#8208;catalyzed vitrimers with white&#8208;light emissions via the synergies between blue and yellow light for light&#8208;emitting diode encapsulations is proposed and developed, where the successful unification of photochemistry and dynamic bond chemistry allows for a rare integration of photoluminescence, dynamic stability, and sustainability in a system.








Abstract
Currently available encapsulating materials for white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) have certain limitations, such as the toxicity of phosphors and the non&#8208;recyclable nature of the encapsulating materials. In this study, relatively promising encapsulating materials with two significant advantages are developed. First, the chips can be directly encapsulated without phosphors using luminescent encapsulating materials. Second, the encapsulating materials can be reprocessed for recycling via intramolecular catalysis. To this end, blue&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (BEVs) are prepared by the reaction of epoxy resin with amines and are found to exhibit strong blue emission and fast stress relaxation via internal catalysis. To obtain white&#8208;light emission, a well&#8208;designed yellow component, perylenetetracarboxylic dianhydride, is grafted into the BEVs to generate white&#8208;light&#8208;emitting vitrimers (WEVs). A rare synergy of blue&#8208; and yellow&#8208;light emission affords white&#8208;light emission. When the WEV is used as an encapsulating adhesive for 365 nm LED chips without inorganic phosphors, stable white light with CIE coordinates (0.30, 0.32) is successfully achieved, indicating a promising future for WLED encapsulation.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Miniaturized Optical Biosensor for Fast and Multiplexing Plasmonic Detection of High&#8208; and Low&#8208;Molecular&#8208;Weight Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A miniaturized optical biosensor based on organic optoelectronic and nanoplasmonic components, able to perform fast and multiplex plasmonic detection of analytical targets for milk quality and safety: lactoferrin and streptomycin, is presented. Software&#8208;based data analysis and calibration of the sensor is reported, which shows for lactoferrin a limit of detection of 3.7 &#181;g mL&#8722;1, comparable with a reference benchtop analytical instrument.








Abstract
Optical biosensors based on plasmonic sensing schemes combine high sensitivity and selectivity with label&#8208;free detection. However, the use of bulky optical components is still hampering the possibility of obtaining miniaturized systems required for analysis in real settings. Here, a fully miniaturized optical biosensor prototype based on plasmonic detection is demonstrated, which enables fast and multiplex sensing of analytes with high&#8208; and low molecular weight (80&#8239;000 and 582 Da) as quality and safety parameters for milk: a protein (lactoferrin) and an antibiotic (streptomycin). The optical sensor is based on the smart integration of: i) miniaturized organic optoelectronic devices used as light&#8208;emitting and light&#8208;sensing elements and ii) a functionalized nanostructured plasmonic grating for highly sensitive and specific localized surface plasmon resonance (SPR) detection. The sensor provides quantitative and linear response reaching a limit of detection of 10&#8722;4 refractive index units once it is calibrated by standard solutions. Analyte&#8208;specific and rapid (15 min long) immunoassay&#8208;based detection is demonstrated for both targets. By using a custom algorithm based on principal&#8208;component analysis, a linear dose&#8211;response curve is constructed which correlates with a limit of detection (LOD) as low as 3.7&#160;&#181;g mL&#8722;1 for lactoferrin, thus assessing that the miniaturized optical biosensor is well&#8208;aligned with the chosen reference benchtop SPR method.

         <title>Carbon Dots with Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Lasing for Colorful Speckle&#8208;Free Laser Imaging and Dynamical Holographic Display</title>

Abstract
As a new solution&#8208;processable laser material, carbon dots (CDs) offer advantages of non&#8208;toxicity, low cost, and high stability, which are conducive to the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers. We prepared full&#8208;color CDs (FC&#8208;CDs) with bright&#8208;blue, green, yellow, red, deep&#8208;red, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence. Their photoluminescence emission ranged from 431 to 714&#160;nm. The FC&#8208;CDs showed narrow full widths at half maximum in the range of 44&#8211;76&#160;nm, with concurrent high radiative transition rates (KR) of 0.54&#8211;1.74 &#215; 108 s&#8722;1; their performance is comparable to that of organic laser dyes, indicating their good gain potential for lasers. Laser pumping of the FC&#8208;CDs gave laser outputs at 467.3, 533.5, 577.4, 616.3, 653.5, and 705.1&#160;nm, spanning from blue to NIR region, and covering 140% of the NTSC color gamut. The FC&#8208;CDs showed high Q&#8208;factors (2000&#8211;5500), appreciable gain coefficients (9&#8211;21.5 cm&#8722;1), and better stability (&#8764;100%@4&#8211;7&#160;h) than commercial laser dyes. These excellent properties make them suitable for high&#8208;quality, colorful, speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display. Our findings will be helpful in promoting the practical applications and development of solution&#8208;processable CD&#8208;based lasers.

         <title>Toward a Novel Energy&#8208;Dissipation Metamaterial with Tensegrity Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>A new dissipator with a tensegrity&#8208;based architecture that is highly customizable is presented. It has movement amplification capabilities due to its internal geometry and it is possible to control its stiffness and damping by adjusting the pre&#8208;strain. A 3D&#8208;printed prototype is analyzed and its excellent dissipation abilities are confirmed. Furthermore, this design can serve as a building block for more complex assemblies, like periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.








Abstract
The interest in novel energy&#8208;dissipation devices that offer advanced functionalities for optimal performance in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art engineering applications is growing. In this regard, a highly tunable and innovative dissipator is developed. This dissipator features movement amplification capabilities resulting from the radial replication of a unit&#8208;cell with tensegrity architecture. The kinematic response of the dissipator is analyzed for several layouts, by varying the number of unit&#8208;cells within the device, their internal geometry, and identifying the corresponding locking configurations. A fully operational 3D&#8208;printed prototype is presented, demonstrating its excellent performance in terms of damping capabilities and feasibility. The experimental results are used to validate a numerical model of the flower unit. This model demonstrates the importance of pre&#8208;strain on the overall stiffness and dissipative features of the proposed system. By utilizing these numerical models, it is shown that the proposed device can be used as a building block for more complex assemblies such as periodic metamaterials with tensegrity architecture.

         <title>Tailoring Molecular&#8208;Scale Contact at the Perovskite/Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Material Interface for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
With tailored conjugated ligand design, the 2D/3D heterostructure built in perovskite solar cells enhances the interface adhesion between the polymeric hole&#8208;transporting layer&#8212;PTAA and perovskite, and at the same time, realizes a uniform growth of 2D structure on top of 3D perovskite. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated device yields a 23.7% power conversion efficiency, along with excellent stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have delivered a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of more than 25% and incorporating polymers as hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) can further enhance the stability of devices toward the goal of commercialization. Among the various polymeric hole&#8208;transporting materials, poly(triaryl amine) (PTAA) is one of the promising HTL candidates with good stability; however, the hydrophobicity of PTAA causes problematic interfacial contact with the perovskite, limiting the device performance. Using molecular side&#8208;chain engineering, a uniform 2D perovskite interlayer with conjugated ligands, between 3D perovskites and PTAA is successfully constructed. Further, employing conjugated ligands as cohesive elements, perovskite/PTAA interfacial adhesion is significantly improved. As a result, the thin and lateral extended 2D/3D heterostructure enables as&#8208;fabricated PTAA&#8208;based PSCs to achieve a PCE of 23.7%, improved from the 18% of reference devices. Owing to the increased ion&#8208;migration energy barrier and conformal 2D coating, unencapsulated devices with the new ligands exhibit both superior thermal stability under 60&#160;&#176;C heating and moisture stability in ambient conditions.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Functional V2C MXene Assembly in Facilitating Sulfur Evolution Kinetics and Li&#8208;Ion Sieving toward Practical Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The scale&#8208;identified V2C MXene spheres can synchronously promote sulfur&#8208;evolution kinetics and sieve Li&#8208;ions, thereby showing an outstanding dual protection effect on the sulfur cathode and lithium anode for practically working lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries are considered as one of the most promising candidates to achieve an energy density of 500&#160;Wh kg&#8315;1. However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium&#8208;dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V2C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;computed tomography (X&#8208;ray 3D nano&#8208;CT), small&#8208;angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first&#8208;principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as&#8208;attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li2S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li&#8208;ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion&#8208;sieving effect.

However, the challenges of shuttle effect, sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics, and lithium-dendrite growth severely obstruct their practical implementation. Herein, multiscale V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C MXene (VC) with a spherical confinement structure is designed as a high-efficiency bifunctional promotor for the evolution of sulfur and lithium species in Li&#8211;S batteries. Combining synchrotron X-ray 3D nano-computed tomography (X-ray 3D nano-CT), small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), and first-principle calculations, it is revealed that the activity of VC can be maximized by tuning the scale, and the as-attained functions are conducted as follows: (i) the VC acts as the efficient lithium polysulfide (LiPS) scavenger due to the large number of active sites; (ii) the VC exhibits significantly improved electrocatalytic function for the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S nucleation and decomposition reaction kinetics owing to the scale effect; and (iii) the VC can regulate the dynamic behavior of Li-ions and thus stabilize the lithium plating/stripping effectively on account of the unique ion-sieving effect.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Generic Air&#8208;gen Effect in Nanoporous Materials for Sustainable Energy Harvesting from Air Humidity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Air humidity is a vast, sustainable reservoir of energy that, unlike solar and wind, is continuously available. However, previously described technologies for harvesting energy from air humidity are either not continuous or require unique material synthesis or processing, which has stymied scalability and broad deployment. Here, we report a generic effect for continuous energy harvesting from air humidity, which can be applied to a broad range of inorganic, organic, and biological materials. The common feature of these materials is that they are engineered with appropriate nanopores to allow air water to pass through and undergo dynamic adsorption&#8208;desorption exchange at the porous interface, resulting in surface charging. The top exposed interface experiences such dynamic interaction more than the bottom sealed interface in a thin&#8208;film device structure, yielding a spontaneous and sustained charging gradient for continuous electric output. Analyses of material properties and electric outputs lead to a &#8220;leaky capacitor&#8221; model that can describe how electricity is harvested and predict current behaviors consistent with experiments. Predictions from the model guide the fabrication of devices made from heterogeneous junctions of different material combinations to further expand the device category. The work opens a wide door for the broad exploration of sustainable electricity from ambient air.

Abstract
Drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections are prominent problems in the field of antibacterial medicine, seriously affecting human and animal health. Despite the great potential of nanomaterials in the antibacterial field, overcoming the paradox of size and charge, efficient penetration, and retention within biofilms remain a formidable challenge. Here, we designed self&#8208;assembling chimeric peptide nano&#8208;assemblies composed of multiple functional fragments for the treatment of drug&#8208;resistant bacteria and biofilm&#8208;associated infections. Notably, the chimeric peptide self&#8208;assembling into nanofibers at pH 7.4, transformable into nanoparticles in the acidic biofilm&#8208;infected microenvironment at pH 5.0, thus achieving a size reduction and charge increase, improving the penetration into the bacterial biofilms, and killing drug&#8208;resistant bacteria by a mechanism dominated by membrane cleavage. In vivo mouse and piglet infection models confirm the ability of chimeric peptide nano&#8208;assemblies to reduce bacterial load within biofilms. Collectively, this research on pathological environment&#8208;driven nano&#8208;structural transformations may provide a theoretical basis for designing high&#8208;performance antibacterial nanomaterials and advance the application of peptide&#8208;based nanomaterials in medicine and animal husbandry.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. The present paper provides a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that is solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, w e determine the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Flexible Electrodes for Brain&#8208;Computer Interface System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Brain&#8208;computer interface (BCI) has been the subject of extensive research recently. Governments and companies have substantially invested in relevant research and applications. The restoration of communication and motor function, the treatment of psychological disorders, gaming, and other daily and therapeutic applications all benefit from BCI. The electrodes hold the key to the essential, fundamental BCI precondition of electrical brain activity detection and delivery. However, the traditional rigid electrodes are limited due to their&#160;mismatch&#160;in Young's&#160;modulus, potential damages to the human body and a decline in signal quality with time. These factors make the development of flexible electrodes vital and urgent. Flexible electrodes made of soft materials have grown in popularity in recent years as an alternative to conventional rigid electrodes because they offer greater conformance, the potential for higher signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR) signals, and a wider range of applications. Therefore, the latest classifications and future developmental directions of fabricating these flexible electrodes are explored in this paper to further encourage the speedy advent of flexible electrodes for BCI. In summary, the perspectives and future outlook for this developing discipline are provided.

         <title>MXene&#8208;based Functional Platforms for Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recently, 2D transition metal carbide, nitride, and carbonitrides (MXenes) materials stand out in the field of tumor therapy, particularly in the construction of functional platforms for optimal antitumor therapy due to their high specific surface area, tunable performance, strong absorption of near&#8208;infrared light as well as preferable surface plasmon resonance effect. In this review, we summarize the progress of MXene&#8208;mediated antitumor therapy after appropriate modifications or integration procedures. We discuss in detail the enhanced antitumor treatments directly performed by MXenes, the significant improving effect of MXenes on different antitumor therapies, as well as the MXene&#8208;mediated imaging&#8208;guided antitumor strategies. Moreover, the existing challenges and future development directions of MXenes in tumor therapy are presented.

         <title>Low&#8208;power and Field&#8208;free Perpendicular Magnetic Memory Driven by Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Giant spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) from topological insulators (TIs) has great potential for the low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;driven magnetic random&#8208;access memory (SOT&#8208;MRAM). Here, we demonstrate the functional 3&#8208;terminal SOT&#8208;MRAM device by integrating the TI [(BiSb)2Te3] with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), where the tunneling magnetoresistance is employed for the effective reading method. The ultralow switching current density of 1.5 &#215; 105 A cm&#8722;2 is achieved in the TI&#8208;pMTJ device at room temperature, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional heavy metals&#8208;based systems, due to the high SOT efficiency &#952;SH = 1.16 of (BiSb)2Te3. Furthermore, all&#8208;electrical field&#8208;free writing is realized by the synergistic effect of a small spin&#8208;transfer torque current during the SOT. The thermal stability factor (&#916; = 66) shows the high retention time (&gt; 10 years) of the TI&#8208;pMTJ device. This work sheds light to the future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density, and high&#8208;endurance/retention magnetic memory technology based on quantum materials.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;based robotics approach for targeting fungal infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fungal pathogens have been designated by the World Health Organization as microbial threats of the highest priority for global health. It remains a major challenge to improve antifungal efficacy at the site of infection while avoiding off&#8208;target effects, fungal spreading, and drug tolerance. Here, w e develop a nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotic platform that directs localized catalysis to the infection site with microscale precision to achieve targeted and rapid fungal killing. Using electromagnetic field frequency modulation and fine&#8208;scale spatiotemporal control, structured iron oxide nanozyme assemblies are formed that display tunable dynamic shape transformation and catalysis activation. The catalytic activity varies depending on the motion, velocity, and shape providing controllable reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. Unexpectedly, nanozyme assemblies bind avidly to fungal (Candida albicans) surfaces to enable concentrated accumulation and targeted ROS&#8208;mediated killing in situ. By exploiting these tunable properties and selective binding, localized antifungal activity is achieved using in vivo&#8208;like cell spheroid and animal tissue infection models. Structured nanozyme assemblies are directed to Candida&#8208;infected sites using programmable algorithms to perform precisely guided spatial targeting and on&#8208;site catalysis resulting in fungal eradication within 10 minutes. This nanozyme&#8208;based microrobotics approach provides a uniquely effective and targeted therapeutic modality for pathogen elimination at the infection site.

Abstract
Mesoporous microparticles have the potential to be used in various fields, such as energy generation, sensing and the environmental field. Recently, the process of making homogeneous microparticles in an economical and environmentally friendly way has gained much attention. Herein, w e produce rectangular mesoporous microblocks of various designs by manipulating the fragmentation of colloidal films consisting of micropyramids while controlling the notch angles of pyramidal edges. During calcination of the colloidal films, cracks are generated in the valleys of micropyramids acting as notches, and the angle of notches can be controlled by the prepattern underneath the micropyramids. By changing the location of notches with sharp angles, w e control the shape of microblocks with excellent uniformity. After detaching the microblocks from substrates, mesoporous microparticles of various sizes with multiple functions are easily produced. W e demonstrate anticounterfeiting functions by encoding the rotation angles of rectangular microblocks of various sizes. In addition, the mesoporous microparticles can be utilized for separating desired chemicals mixed with chemicals of different charges. The method of fabricating size&#8208;tunable functionalized mesoporous microblocks can be a platform technology to prepare special films and catalysts and for environmental applications.

         <title>Atom&#8208;Precise Heteroatom Core&#8208;Tailoring of Nanoclusters for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Titania&#8208;supported atomically precise gold&#8208;silver core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, Au12Ag32/TiO2, are fabricated through strong cluster&#8211;support interactions. The controlled modulation of the electronic structure of the nanoclusters through the incorporation of the metallic gold core plays a critical role in the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers, making Au12Ag32/TiO2 a &#8776;38&#8208;fold more efficient photocatalyst than TiO2 for hydrogen production (6.8 mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) from solar water splitting.








Abstract
While core&#8211;shell nanomaterials are highly desirable for realizing enhanced optical and catalytic properties, their synthesis with atomic&#8208;level control is challenging. Here, the synthesis and crystal structure of [Au12Ag32(SePh)30]4&#8722;, the first example of selenolated Au&#8211;Ag core&#8211;shell nanoclusters, comprising a gold icosahedron core trapped in a silver dodecahedron, which is protected by an Ag12(SePh)30 shell, is presented. The gold core strongly modifies the overall electronic structure and induces synergistic effects, resulting in high enhancements in the stability and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II photoluminescence. The Au12Ag32 and its homometal analog Ag44, show strong interactions with oxygen vacancies of TiO2, facilitating the interfacial charge transfer for photocatalysis. Indeed, the Au12Ag32/TiO2 exhibits remarkable solar H2 production (6810&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1), which is &#8776;6.2 and &#8776;37.8 times higher than that of Ag44/TiO2 and TiO2, respectively. Good stability and recyclability with minimal catalytic activity loss are additional features of Au12Ag32/TiO2. The experimental and computational results reveal that the Au12Ag32 acts as an efficient cocatalyst by possessing a favorable electronic structure that aligns well with the TiO2 bands for the enhanced separation of photoinduced charge carriers due to the relatively negatively charged Au12 core. These atomistic insights will motivate uncovering of the structure&#8211;catalytic activity relationships of other nanoclusters.

Abstract
Epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is a polyfactorial process associated with alterations in metabolic pathways. A high&#8208;performance screening tool for EOC is in high demand to improve prognostic outcome but is still missing. Here, a concave octahedron Mn2O3/(Co,Mn)(Co,Mn)2O4 (MO/CMO) composite with a heterojunction, rough surface, hollow interior, and sharp corners is developed to record metabolic patterns of ovarian tumors by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (LDI&#8208;MS). The MO/CMO composites with multiple physical effects induce enhanced light absorption, preferred charge transfer, increased photothermal conversion, and selective trapping of small molecules. The MO/CMO shows &#8776;2&#8211;5&#8208;fold signal enhancement compared to mono&#8208; or dual&#8208;enhancement counterparts, and &#8776;10&#8211;48&#8208;fold compared to the commercialized products. Subsequently, serum metabolic fingerprints of ovarian tumors are revealed by MO/CMO&#8208;assisted LDI&#8208;MS, achieving high reproducibility of direct serum detection without treatment. Furthermore, machine learning of the metabolic fingerprints distinguishes malignant ovarian tumors from benign controls with the area under the curve value of 0.987. Finally, seven metabolites associated with the progression of ovarian tumors are screened as potential biomarkers. The approach guides the future depiction of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrix for intensive MS detection and accelerates the growth of nanomaterials&#8208;based platforms toward precision diagnosis scenarios.

Fingertip perspiration is a vital process within human predation, to which the species owes its survival and its biological success. In this paper, the unique human ability of extensive perspiration and controlled friction in self&#8208;assembled cholesteric liquid crystals is recreated, mimicking the natural processes that occur in the dermis and epidermis of human skin. This is achieved by inducing porosity in responsive, liquid&#8208;bearing material through the controlled&#8208;polymerization phase&#8208;separation process. The unique topography of human fingerprints is further emulated in the materials by balancing the parallel chirality&#8208;induced force and the perpendicular substrate&#8208;anchoring force during synthesis. As a result, artificial fingertips are capable of secreting and re&#8208;absorbing liquid upon light illumination. By demonstrating the function of the soft material in a tribological aspect, it exhibits a controllable anti&#8208;sliding property&#160;comparable to human fingertips and subsequently attains a higher degree of biomimicry. This biomimetic fingertip is envisioned being applied in a multitude of fields, ranging from biomedical instruments to interactive, human&#8208;like soft robotic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Here, a coating made of liquid crystal networks&#160;is designed to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography, but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible as controlled by light, which can be used to fine-tune the tribological property when the coating is in contact with other surfaces.

         <title>Oxidization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Triggered Rapid Preparation of Large&#8208;Area Single&#8208;Crystal Cu(111) Foil</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foils, rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) (up to 320 cm2) is achieved within 60 min, thanks to the transformation of the thin CuxO layer to a Cu(111) seed layer. Large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene films are synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111), and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart.








Abstract
The controlled preparation of single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is intensively investigated owing to the superior properties of Cu(111) and its advantages in synthesizing high&#8208;quality 2D materials, especially graphene. However, the accessibility of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) is still hindered by time&#8208;consuming, complicated, and high&#8208;cost preparation methods. Here, the oxidization&#8208;temperature&#8208;triggered rapid preparation of large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) in which an area up to 320 cm2 is prepared within 60 min, and where low&#8208;temperature oxidization of polycrystalline Cu foil surface plays a vital role, is reported. A mechanism is proposed, by which the thin CuxO layer transforms to a Cu(111) seed layer on the surface of Cu to induce the formation of a large&#8208;area Cu(111) foil, which is supported by both experimental data and molecular dynamics simulation results. In addition, a large&#8208;size high&#8208;quality graphene film is synthesized on the single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) foil surface and the graphene/Cu(111) composites exhibit enhanced thermal conductivity and ductility compared to their polycrystalline counterpart. This work, therefore, not only provides a new avenue toward the monocrystallinity of Cu with specific planes but also contributes to improving the mass production of high&#8208;quality 2D materials.

         <title>Scalable Fabrication of Dual&#8208;Function Fabric for Zero&#8208;Energy Thermal Environmental Management through Multiband, Synergistic, and Asymmetric Optical Modulations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;function fabric with both radiative cooling and solar heating functions on two sides of the fabric is developed. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance for zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. As a roof coating, the dual&#8208;function fabric can achieve &#8776;22.4&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 energy saving, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 billion kg global CO2 emission reduction.








Abstract
Solar heating and radiative cooling techniques have been proposed for passive space thermal management to reduce the global energy burden. However, the currently used single&#8208;function envelope/coating materials can only achieve static temperature regulation, presenting limited energy savings and poor adaption to dynamic environments. In this study, a sandwich&#8208;structured fabric, composed of vertical graphene, graphene glass fiber fabric, and polyacrylonitrile nanofibers is developed, with heating and cooling functions integrated through multiband, synergistic, (solar spectrum and mid&#8208;infrared ranges) and asymmetric optical modulations on two sides of the fabric. The dual&#8208;function fabric demonstrates high adaption to the dynamic environment and superior performance in a zero&#8208;energy&#8208;input temperature regulation. Furthermore, it demonstrates &#8776;15.5 and &#8776;31.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;2 y&#8722;1 higher annual energy savings compared to those of their cooling&#8208;only and heating&#8208;only counterparts, corresponding to &#8776;173.7 MT reduction in the global CO2 emission. The fabric exhibits high scalability for batch manufacturing with commercially abundant raw materials and facile technologies, providing a favorable guarantee of its mass production and use.

         <title>Engineering and Development of a Tissue Model for the Evaluation of Microneedle Penetration Ability, Drug Diffusion, Photothermal Activity, and Ultrasound Imaging: A Promising Surrogate to Ex Vivo and In Vivo Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tissue models based on hydrogel/silicone are prepared for different applications in biomedical sectors. Such customized tissue surrogates can be employed as a platform to evaluate the ability of microneedle insertion, the diffusion of drugs, the activity of photothermal agents, as well as the performance of ultrasound bioimaging.








Abstract
Driven by regulatory authorities and the ever&#8208;growing demands from industry, various artificial tissue models have been developed. Nevertheless, there is no model to date that is capable of mimicking the biomechanical properties of the skin whilst exhibiting the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity properties of the skin layers. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study, tissue surrogates based on gel and silicone are fabricated for the evaluation of microneedle penetration, drug diffusion, photothermal activity, and ultrasound bioimaging. The silicone layer aims to imitate the stratum corneum while the gel layer aims to mimic the water&#8208;rich viable epidermis and dermis present in in vivo tissues. The diffusion of drugs across the tissue model is assessed, and the results reveal that the proposed tissue model shows similar behavior to a cancerous kidney. In place of typical in vitro aqueous solutions, this model can also be employed for evaluating the photoactivity of photothermal agents since the tissue model shows a similar heating profile to skin of mice when irradiated with near&#8208;infrared laser. In addition, the designed tissue model exhibits promising results for biomedical applications in optical coherence tomography and ultrasound imaging. Such a tissue model paves the way to reduce the use of animals testing in research whilst obviating ethical concerns.

         <title>Mobile Trions in Electrically Tunable 2D Hybrid Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.








Abstract
2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light&#8208;harvesting and &#8208;emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few&#8208;layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate&#8208;tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 1012&#160;cm&#8722;2. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light&#8208;emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.

&lt;p&gt;Electrically controlled, bipolar tuning of the excitonic light emission is achieved in 2D perovskites via the field effect in a van der Waals heterostructure. The formation of trions with exceptionally high binding energies up to 46&#160;meV is demonstrated. Localized at liquid helium temperature, these charged excitons become mobile toward 50&#160;K with effective mobilities up to 200 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D hybrid perovskites are currently in the spotlight of material research for light-harvesting and -emitting applications. It remains extremely challenging, however, to externally control their optical response due to the difficulties of introducing electrical doping. Here, an approach of interfacing ultrathin sheets of perovskites with few-layer graphene and hexagonal boron nitride into gate-tunable, hybrid heterostructures, is demonstrated. It allows for bipolar, continuous tuning of light emission and absorption in 2D perovskites by electrically injecting carriers to densities as high as 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. This reveals the emergence of both negatively and positively charged excitons, or trions, with binding energies up to 46&#160;meV, among the highest measured for 2D systems. Trions are shown to dominate light emission and propagate with mobilities reaching 200&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at elevated temperatures. The findings introduce the physics of interacting mixtures of optical and electrical excitations to the broad family of 2D inorganic&#8211;organic nanostructures. The presented strategy to electrically control the optical response of 2D perovskites highlights it as a promising material platform toward electrically modulated light-emitters, externally guided charged exciton currents, and exciton transistors based on layered, hybrid&#160;semiconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modular Design of a Polymer&#8208;Bilayer&#8208;Based Mechanically Compliant Worm&#8208;Like Robot</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically compliant earthworm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular soft body that primarily consists of polymers is presented. The robot is based on electrothermally actuated polymer&#8208;bilayer&#8208;based segments and is capable of directional locomotion on various surfaces, turning on the spot, steering during forward movement, and, most strikingly, squeezing itself through constrictions that are smaller than its cross&#8208;section in the resting state.








Abstract
Soft earthworm&#8208;like robots that exhibit mechanical compliance can, in principle, navigate through uneven terrains and constricted spaces that are inaccessible to traditional legged and wheeled robots. However, unlike the biological originals that&#160;they mimic, most of the worm&#8208;like robots reported to date contain rigid components that limit their compliance, such as electromotors or pressure&#8208;driven actuation systems. Here, a mechanically compliant worm&#8208;like robot with a fully modular body that is based on soft polymers is reported. The robot is composed of strategically assembled, electrothermally activated polymer bilayer actuators, which are based on a semicrystalline polyurethane with an exceptionally large nonlinear thermal expansion coefficient. The segments are designed on the basis of a modified Timoshenko model, and finite element analysis simulation is used to describe their performance. Upon electrical activation of the segments with basic waveform patterns, the robot can move through repeatable peristaltic locomotion on exceptionally slippery or sticky surfaces and it can be oriented in any direction. The soft body enables the robot to wriggle through openings and tunnels that are much smaller than its cross&#8208;section.

         <title>All&#8208;Transfer Electrode Interface Engineering Toward Harsh&#8208;Environment&#8208;Resistant MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors are demonstrated by engineering the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer technique of van der Waals electrodes. The intact and defect&#8208;free interfaces not only reduce the Schottky barrier height at electrodes, but enable high resistances of the MoS2 devices to humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes.








Abstract
Nanoscale electronic devices that can work in harsh environments are in high demand for wearable, automotive, and aerospace electronics. Clean and defect&#8208;free interfaces are of vital importance for building nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices. However, current nanoscale devices are subject to failure in these environments, especially at defective electrode&#8211;channel interfaces. Here, harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant MoS2 transistors are developed by engineering electrode&#8211;channel interfaces with an all&#8208;transfer of van der Waals electrodes. The delivered defect&#8208;free, graphene&#8208;buffered electrodes keep the electrode&#8211;channel interfaces intact and robust. As a result, the as&#8208;fabricated MoS2 devices have reduced Schottky barrier heights, leading to a very large on&#8208;state current and high carrier mobility. More importantly, the defect&#8208;free, hydrophobic graphene buffer layer prevents metal diffusion from the electrodes to MoS2 and the intercalation of water molecules at the electrode&#8211;MoS2 interfaces. This enables high resistances of MoS2 devices with all&#8208;transfer electrodes to various harsh environments, including humid, oxidizing, and high&#8208;temperature environments, surpassing the devices with other kinds of electrodes. The work deepens the understanding of the roles of electrode&#8211;channel interfaces in nanoscale devices and provides a promising interface engineering strategy to build nanoscale harsh&#8208;environment&#8208;resistant devices.

         <dc:description>
Electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled silicon&#8208; and Mott&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors ares developed, which exhibit a large superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18), an ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA, high photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and great detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones). Night vision pattern recognition even with noisy inputs is demonstrated, offering intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor vision processing.








Abstract
Light&#8208;intensity selective superlinear photodetectors with ultralow dark current can provide an essential breakthrough for the development of high&#8208;performing near&#8208;sensor vision processing. However, the development of near&#8208;sensor vision processing is not only conceptually important for device operation (given that sensors naturally exhibit linear/sublinear responses), but also essential to get rid of the massive amount of data generated during object sensing and classification with noisy inputs. Therefore, achieving the giant superlinear photoresponse while maintaining the picoampere leakage current, irrespective of the measurement bias, is one of the most challenging tasks. Here, Mott material (vanadium dioxide) and silicon&#8208;based integrated infrared photodetectors are developed that show giant superlinear photoresponse (exponent &gt;18) and ultralow dark current of 4.46&#160;pA. Specifically, the device demonstrates an electro&#8208;opto&#8208;coupled insulator&#8208;to&#8208;metal transition, which leads to outstanding photocurrent on/off ratio (&gt;106), a high responsivity (&gt;1&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1), and excellent detectivity (&gt;1012&#160;Jones), while maintaining response speed (&#964;r&#160;=&#160;6&#160;&#181;s and &#964;f&#160;=&#160;10&#160;&#181;s). Further, intensity&#8208;selective near&#8208;sensor processing is demonstrated and night vision pattern reorganization even with noisy inputs is exhibited. This research will pave the way for the creation of high&#8208;performance photodetectors with potential uses, such as in night vision, pattern recognition, and neuromorphic processing.

         <title>Principles for 2D&#8208;Material&#8208;Assisted Nitrides Epitaxial Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS2 for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.








Abstract
Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single&#8208;crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single&#8208;crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS2. These results provide a suitable growth&#8208;front construction strategy for high&#8208;quality 2D&#8208;material&#8208;assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

&lt;p&gt;Through systematically studying the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D materials&#160;interface, it is found that graphene is the ideal buffer layer for nitrides&#8217; remote epitaxy while WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for nitrides&#8217; van der Waals epitaxy. As a result, a suitable growth-front construction strategies and basic guidelines for high-quality 2D-materials-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy is presented. This work may open a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Beyond traditional heteroepitaxy, 2D-materials-assisted epitaxy opens opportunities to revolutionize future material integration methods. However, basic principles in 2D-material-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy remain unclear, which impedes understanding the essence, thus hindering its progress. Here, the crystallographic information of nitrides/2D material interface is theoretically established, which is further confirmed experimentally. It is found that the atomic interaction at the nitrides/2D material interface is related to the nature of underlying substrates. For single-crystalline substrates, the heterointerface behaves like a covalent one and the epilayer inherits the substrate's lattice. Meanwhile, for amorphous substrates, the heterointerface tends to be a van der Waals one and strongly relies on the properties of 2D materials. Therefore, modulated by graphene, the nitrides&#8217; epilayer is polycrystalline. In contrast, single-crystalline GaN films are successfully achieved on WS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. These results provide a suitable growth-front construction strategy for high-quality 2D-material-assisted nitrides&#8217; epitaxy. It also opens a pathway toward various semiconductors heterointegration.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dynamic and Reversible Decoration of DNA&#8208;Based Scaffolds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An enzyme&#8208;based approach to decorating DNA&#8208;based scaffolds in a dynamic and reversible way is demonstrated. Enzyme&#8208;responsive strands in the assembled scaffolds undergo degradation and spontaneous replacement by strands decorated with different labels in the presence of their corresponding enzymes.








Abstract
An approach to achieving dynamic and reversible decoration of DNA&#8208;based scaffolds is demonstrated here. To do this, rationally engineered DNA tiles containing enzyme&#8208;responsive strands covalently conjugated to different molecular labels are employed. These strands are designed to be recognized and degraded by specific enzymes (i.e., Ribonuclease H, RNase H, or Uracil DNA Glycosylase, UDG) inducing their spontaneous de&#8208;hybridization from the assembled tile and replacement by a new strand conjugated to a different label. Multiple enzyme&#8208;responsive strands that specifically respond to different enzymes allow for dynamic, orthogonal, and reversible decoration of the DNA structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle of the strategy, the possibility to orthogonally control the distribution of different labels (i.e., fluorophores and small molecules) on the same scaffold without crosstalk is demonstrated. By doing so, DNA scaffolds that display different antibody recognition patterns are obtained. The approach offers the possibility to control the decoration of higher&#8208;order supramolecular assemblies (including origami) with several functional moieties to achieve functional biomaterials with improved adaptability, precision, and sensing capabilities.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;sensing of their body shape is significant for soft robots planning trajectories and actions, which can also be a feedback to interactions with the environment. We&#160;present a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin, confluence with machine learning technique, endows soft robots with proprioception of their own status and exteroception of environment awareness, exhibiting advanced artificial intelligence.








Abstract
Inspired by natural biological systems, soft robots have recently been developed, showing tremendous potential in real&#8208;world applications because of their intrinsic softness and deformability. The confluence of electronic skins and machine learning is extensively studied to create effective biomimetic robotic systems. Based on a differential piezoelectric matrix, this study presents a shape&#8208;sensing electronic skin (SSES) that can recognize surface conformations with minimal interference from pressing, stretching, or other surrounding stimuli. It is then integrated with soft robots to reconstruct their shape during movement, serving as a proprioceptive sense. Additionally, the robot can utilize machine learning to identify various terrains, demonstrating exteroception and pointing toward more advanced autonomous robots capable of performing real&#8208;world tasks in challenging environments.

         <title>Heteroepitaxy of 2D CuCr2Te4 with Robust Room&#8208;temperature Ferromagnetism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a heteroepitaxial growth strategy of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and Cr2Te3, with thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica and an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K via interfacial charge transfer in lattice&#8208;matched CuCr2Te4/Cr2Te3 heterostructure. The thickness&#8208;dependent room&#8208;temperature 2D ferromagnetic heterostructures are promising for constructing functional spintronic devices.








Abstract
Magnetic materials in 2D have attracted widespread attention for their intriguing magnetic properties. 2D magnetic heterostructures can provide unprecedented opportunities for exploring fundamental physics and novel spintronic devices. Here, the heteroepitaxial growth of ferromagnetic CuCr2Te4 nanosheets is reported on Cr2Te3 and mica by chemical vapor deposition. Magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect measurements reveal the thickness&#8208;dependent ferromagnetism of CuCr2Te4 nanosheets on mica, where a decrease of Curie temperature (TC) from 320 to 260&#160;K and an enhancement of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy with reducing thickness are observed. Moreover, lattice&#8208;matched heteroepitaxial ultrathin CuCr2Te4 on Cr2Te3 exhibits an enhanced robust ferromagnetism with TC up to 340&#160;K due to the interfacial charge transfer. Stripe&#8208;type magnetic domains and single magnetic domain are discovered in this heterostructure with different thicknesses. The work provides a way to construct robust room&#8208;temperature 2D magnetic heterostructures for functional spintronic devices.

         <title>Magnetic&#8211;Acoustic Sequentially Actuated CAR T Cell Microrobots for Precision Navigation and In Situ Antitumor Immunoactivation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
M&#8208;CAR Ts are created by decorating CAR T cells with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation, and they are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and antitumor immune responses, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated CAR T. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy.








Abstract
Despite its clinical success, chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR T)&#8208;cell immunotherapy remains limited in solid tumors, owing to the harsh physical barriers and immunosuppressive microenvironment. Here a CAR&#8208;T&#8208;cell&#8208;based live microrobot (M&#8208;CAR T) is created by decorating CAR T with immunomagnetic beads using click conjugation. M&#8208;CAR Ts are capable of magnetic&#8211;acoustic actuation for precision targeting and in situ activation of antitumor immune responses. Sequential actuation endows M&#8208;CAR Ts with magnetically actuated anti&#8208;flow and obstacle avoidance as well as tissue penetration driven by acoustic propulsion, enabling efficient migration and accumulation in artificial tumor models. In vivo, sequentially actuated M&#8208;CAR Ts achieves long&#8208;distance targeting and accumulate at the peritumoural area under programmable magnetic guidance, and subsequently acoustic tweezers actuate M&#8208;CAR Ts to migrate&#160;into deep tumor tissues, resulting in a 6.6&#8208;fold increase in accumulated exogenous CD8+ CAR T cells compared with that without actuation. Anti&#8208;CD3/CD28 immunomagnetic beads stimulate infiltrated CAR T proliferation and activation in situ, significantly enhancing their antitumor efficacy. Thus, this&#160;sequential&#8208;actuation&#8208;guided cell microrobot combines the merits of autonomous targeting and penetration of intelligent robots with in situ T&#8208;cell immunoactivation, and holds considerable promise for precision navigation and cancer immunotherapies.

         <title>Blocking Spatiotemporal Crosstalk between Subcellular Organelles for Enhancing Anticancer Therapy with Nanointercepters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organelle communication interception nanosystem is constructed with an amorphous Fe0 core and an ultrathin crystalline Fe3O4 shell (ACFeNPs). &#183;OH can efficiently generate along with the spatiotemporal trajectory of ACFeNPs within tumor cells. ACFeNPs transfer from lysosomes to the endoplasmic reticulum and block the crosstalk between them, sequentially trigger&#160;AMPK/mTOR, lysosomal damage, and the IRE1/JNK signaling pathway, ultimately inducing deep apoptosis of tumor cells that cannot be alleviated. All experiments confirm the enhanced tumor inhibition of the organelle communication spatiotemporal interception strategy and reveal the biomolecular mechanism.








Abstract
The spatiotemporal characterization of signaling crosstalk between subcellular organelles is crucial for the therapeutic effect of malignant tumors. Blocking interactive crosstalk in this fashion is significant but challenging. Herein, a communication interception strategy is reported, which blocks spatiotemporal crosstalk between subcellular organelles for cancer therapy with underlying molecular mechanisms. Briefly, amorphous&#8208;core@crystalline&#8208;shell Fe@Fe3O4 nanoparticles (ACFeNPs) are fabricated to specifically block the crosstalk between lysosomes and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) by hydroxyl radicals generated along with their trajectory through heterogeneous Fenton reaction. ACFeNPs initially enter lysosomes and trigger autophagy, then continuous lysosomal damage blocks the generation of functional autolysosomes, which mediates ER&#8211;lysosome crosstalk, thus the autophagy is paralyzed. Thereafter, released ACFeNPs from lysosomes induce ER stress. Without the alleviation by autophagy, the ER&#8208;stress&#8208;associated apoptotic pathway is fully activated, resulting in a remarkable therapeutic effect. This strategy provides a wide venue for nanomedicine to exert biological advantages and confers new perspective for the design of novel anticancer drugs.

         <title>Young Exosome Bio&#8208;Nanoparticles Restore Aging&#8208;Impaired Tendon Stem/Progenitor Cell Function and Reparative Capacity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exosome&#160;bio&#8208;nanoparticles from stem cells of human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) inhibit senescent phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells and rescue their tenogenic differentiation capacity by inhibiting histone methylation and nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B. Local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres exhibits excellent anti&#8208;aging effects, including reducing senescent cells and heterotopic&#160;ossification, and thereby restores endogenous tendon regeneration capacity in aged rats.








Abstract
Aging impairs tendon stem/progenitor&#160;cell function and tendon homeostasis, however, effective treatments for aging&#8208;induced tendon diseases are lacking. Exosomes are naturally derived nanoparticles that contain bioactive molecules, and therefore, have attracted great interest in tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. In this study, it is shown that young exosomes secreted by stem cells from human exfoliated deciduous teeth (SHED&#8208;Exos) possess abundant anti&#8208;aging signals. These young bio&#8208;nanoparticles can alleviate the aging phenotypes of aged tendon stem/progenitor cells (AT&#8208;SCs) and maintain their tenogenic capacity. Mechanistically, SHED&#8208;Exos modulate histone methylation and inhibit nuclear factor&#8208;&#954;B to reverse AT&#8208;SC aging. In a naturally aging mouse model, systemic administration of SHED&#8208;Exo bio&#8208;nanoparticles retards tendon degeneration. Interestingly, local delivery of SHED&#8208;Exos&#8208;loaded microspheres confers anti&#8208;aging phenotypes, including reduced senescent cells and decreased ectopic bone formation, thereby functionally and structurally rescuing endogenous tendon regeneration and repair capacity in aged rats. Overall, SHED&#8208;Exos, as natural bioactive nanoparticles, have promising translational and therapeutic potential for aging&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Tough Hydrogel Electrolytes for Anti&#8208;Freezing Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; are synergistically utilized to create a flexible electrolyte with superior strength, freezing tolerance, high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential over semi&#8208;closed&#8208;pore&#160;counterparts), and stable cycling, benefitting from the suppressed dendritic growth and side reactions (30&#8201;000 cycles), which pushes the limit of flexible batteries toward higher stability in harsh environments.








Abstract
As the soaring demand for energy storage continues to grow, batteries that can cope with extreme conditions are highly desired. Yet, existing battery materials are limited by weak mechanical properties and freeze&#8208;vulnerability, prohibiting safe energy storage in devices that are exposed to low temperature and unusual mechanical impacts. Herein, a fabrication method harnessing the synergistic effect of co&#8208;nonsolvency and &#8220;salting&#8208;out&#8221; that can produce poly(vinyl alcohol) hydrogel electrolytes with unique open&#8208;cell porous structures, composed of strongly aggregated polymer chains, and containing disrupted hydrogen bonds among free water molecules, is introduced. The hydrogel electrolyte simultaneously combines high strength (tensile strength 15.6&#160;MPa), freeze&#8208;tolerance (&lt;&#160;&#8722;77 &#176;C), high mass transport (10&#215; lower overpotential), and dendrite and parasitic reactions suppression for stable performance (30&#8201;000 cycles). The high generality of this method is further demonstrated with poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) and poly(N&#8208;tertbutylacrylamide&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide) hydrogels. This work takes a further step toward flexible battery development for harsh environments.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Nanosecond 2D Perovskite Scintillators by Dielectric Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational design strategy to shorten the scintillation decay time by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and [PbBr6]2&#8722; octahedral emitters in 2D perovskites is shown. Benzimidazole (BM) with conjugated structure inserts between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, shortening the emitting decay time into sub&#8208;nanosecond region. The sub&#8208;nanosecond BM2PbBr4 scintillator exhibits excellent performance in high energy photons and particles detection.








Abstract
Perovskite materials have demonstrated great potential for ultrafast scintillators with high light yield. However, the decay time of perovskite still cannot be further minimized into sub&#8208;nanosecond region, while sub&#8208;nanosecond scintillators are highly demanded in various radiation detection, including high speed X&#8208;ray imaging, time&#8208;of&#8208;flight based tomography or particle discrimination, and timing resolution measurement in synchrotron radiation facilities, etc. Here, a rational design strategy is showed to shorten the scintillation decay time, by maximizing the dielectric difference between organic amines and Pb&#8208;Br octahedral emitters in 2D organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHP). Benzimidazole (BM) with low dielectric constant inserted between [PbBr6]2&#8722; layers, resulting in a surprisingly large exciton binding energy (360.3 &#177; 4.8 meV) of 2D OIHP BM2PbBr4. The emitting decay time is shortened as 0.97&#160;ns, which is smallest among all the perovskite materials. Moreover, the light yield is 3190&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1, which is greatly higher than conventional ultrafast scintillator BaF2 (1500&#160;photons&#160;MeV&#8722;1). The rare combination of ultrafast decay time and considerable light yield renders BM2PbBr4 excellent performance in &#947;&#8208;ray, neutron, &#945;&#8208;particle detection, and the best theoretical coincidence time resolution of 65.1&#160;ps, which is only half of the reference sample LYSO (141.3&#160;ps).

         <title>Tetramode Metamaterials as Phonon Polarizers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An experimental realization and application of a tetramode material are presented. According to Cauchy elasticity, four out of the six deformation modes of such materials are considered &#8220;easy&#8221;. A property that can be exploited as a compact broadband polarizer for transverse phonons. This is demonstrated experimentally with a 3D metamaterial structure fabricated using direct laser writing.








Abstract
In classical Cauchy elasticity, 3D materials exhibit six eigenmodes of deformation. Following the 1995 work of Milton and Cherkaev, extremal elastic materials can be classified by the number of eigenmodes, N, out of these six that are &#8220;easy&#8221;. Using Greek number words, this leads to hexamode (N&#160;= 6), pentamode (N&#160;= 5), tetramode (N&#160;= 4), trimode (N&#160;= 3), dimode (N&#160;= 2), and monomode (N&#160;= 1) materials. While hexamode materials are unstable in all regards, the possibility of pentamode metamaterials (&#8220;meta&#8208;fluids&#8221;) has attracted considerable attention throughout the last decade. Here, inspired by the 2021 theoretical work of Wei, Liu, and Hu, microstructured 3D polymer&#8208;based tetramode metamaterials are designed and characterized by numerical band&#8208;structure calculations, fabricated by laser printing, characterized by ultrasound experiments, and compared to the theoretical ideal. An application in terms of a compact and broadband polarizer for acoustical phonons at ultrasound frequencies is demonstrated.

         <title>Prominent Free Charges Tunneling Through Organic Interlayer of 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
We&#160;have constructed convertible RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 perovskite with one organic amine through a protonation control strategy. Organic cations in (4AEPy)PbI4 participate in band edge construction, making its exciton binding energy as low as 27.3 meV and producing more free carriers.








Abstract
The diversity of organic cations greatly enriches the species of 2D perovskites; traditional 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) and Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) perovskites are synthesized by two different organic amines. Here, according to the difference in pKa values between conjugated acids of monoprotonated and biprotonated 4&#8208;(2&#8208;Aminoethyl)pyridine (4AEPy) ions, the 2D perovskites of RP (4AEPy)2PbI4 and DJ (4AEPy)PbI4 from same organic amine is reported, which can realize reversible transformation under the treatment of HI and NH3, respectively. The interaction of N&#8208;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N hydrogen bond between adjacent organic molecules in (4AEPy)2PbI4 leads to the bending conformation of ethylamine groups, which results in a 2.4 &#197; reduction in layer spacing compared to typical phenylethylamine lead iodine ((PEA)2PbI4) 2D perovskite. Besides, the ethylamine groups of organic layers in (4AEPy)PbI4 are deeply inserted into octahedral cavities and directly participate in the construction of the conduction band minimum, which leads to a small exciton binding energy of 27.3 meV&#160;to&#160;generate&#160;free&#160;charges. The stronger coupling between the organic and inorganic layers and the minor exciton binding energy can promote the DJ phase to possess a more stable structure and better optoelectronic properties. Thus&#160;the (4AEPy)PbI4 device displays better light response and X&#8208;ray detection capability with a high sensitivity of 5627 &#181;C Gyair&#8208;1 cm&#8208;2 and the lowest detectable dose rate of 20 nGyair s&#8208;1.

         <title>Large&#8208;Area Fabrication of Ultrathin Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Facile fabrication of ultrathin NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large area (&gt;200 cm2) with remarkable homogeneity and texture along [00l] direction is presented. This stems from the superior solution processability of the NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets synthesized via a scalable approach. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes exhibit outstanding rejections toward various metal ion and dye solutions while at modest permeance compared with other reported membranes.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;based membranes, featuring potential molecular sieving effects and therefore capable of surmounting the ubiquitous trade&#8208;off between membrane selectivity and permeability, hold great promise for multitudinous chemical separations. Nevertheless, it remains highly challenging for the large&#8208;area fabrication of ultrathin MOF membranes with variable thickness, great homogeneity, and preferential orientation. Herein, this work reports the facile fabrication of ultrathin (down to 20&#160;nm) NUS&#8208;8 membranes in large&#8208;area (&gt;200 cm2) yet with great homogeneity and texture along (00l) direction due to the superior solution processability of the as&#8208;synthesized NUS&#8208;8 nanosheets. The resultant NUS&#8208;8 membranes with good adhesion properties and certain flexibility exhibit excellent rejections (&gt;98% for Mg2+ and Al3+, and dyes with molecular weights larger than 585.5 g mol&#8722;1) toward aqueous separation of various metal ions and dyes at modest permeance (1&#8211;3.2 L m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 bar&#8722;1) due to the well&#8208;aligned structures. Such separation performance outstands among polymetric membranes, thin&#8208;film composite membranes, mixed matrix membranes, and other MOF membranes reported in the literature. The separation mechanism is reasonably discussed based on the experimental and theoretical results. This study opens up novel perspectives for preparing ultrathin and large&#8208;area MOF membranes using the solution processability of MOFs.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Spacing Engineering of Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new A&#8208;site cation aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing of A3Bi2I9&#8208;type HPs by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds and large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) are prepared. The interlayer spacing shortened AG3Bi2I9 SC shows a large mobility&#8208;lifetime product, high sensitivity and low detection limit in X&#8208;ray detection, high spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free A3Bi2I9&#8208;type perovskites are demonstrated as a class of promising semiconductors for high&#8208;performance X&#8208;ray detection due to their high bulk resistivity and strong X&#8208;ray absorption, as well as reduced ion migration. However, due to their long interlamellar distance along their c&#8208;axis, their limited carrier transport along the vertical direction is a bottleneck for their detection sensitivity. Herein, a new A&#8208;site cation of aminoguanidinium (AG) with all&#8208;NH2 terminals is designed to shorten the interlayer spacing by forming more and stronger N&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I hydrogen bonds. The prepared large AG3Bi2I9 single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility&#8208;lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA3Bi2I9 SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1). Therefore, the X&#8208;ray detectors fabricated on the AG3Bi2I9 SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&#8722;1, and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MA3Bi2I9 SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1) X&#8208;ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance lead&#8208;free X&#8208;ray detectors.

The prepared large AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; single crystals (SCs) render shorter interlamellar distance for a larger mobility-lifetime product of 7.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is three times higher than the value measured on the best MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC (2.87 &#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Therefore, the X-ray detectors fabricated on the AG&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC exhibit high sensitivity of 5791 uC&#160;Gy&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, a low detection limit of 2.6&#160;nGy s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1,&lt;/sup&gt; and a short response time of 690&#160;&#181;s, all of which are far better than those of the state-of-the-art MA&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;I&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; SC detectors. The combination of high sensitivity and high stability enables astonishingly high spatial resolution (8.7 lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) X-ray imaging. This work will facilitate the development of low-cost and high-performance lead-free X-ray detectors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiexciton Generation from a 2D Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Perovskite with Nearly 200% Quantum Yield of Red Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiexciton generation (MEG) is found in a 2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskite, phenylammonium cadmium chloride (PACC). The MEG effect induced by Mn2+ doping improves the red phosphorescent quantum yield of PACC from 6% to nearly 200%, thus resulting in a switching from blue to red afterglow.








Abstract
2D organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites (OIHPs) show obvious advantages in the field of optoelectronics due to their high luminescent stability and good solution processability. However, the thermal quenching and self&#8208;absorption of excitons caused by the strong interaction between the inorganic metal ions lead to a low luminescence efficiency of 2D perovskites. Herein, a 2D Cd&#8208;based OIHP phenylammonium cadmium chloride&#160;(PACC) with a weak red phosphorescence (&#934;P&#160;&lt; 6%) at 620&#160;nm and a blue afterglow is reported. Interestingly, the Mn&#8208;doped PACC exhibits very strong red emission with nearly 200% quantum yield and 15&#160;ms lifetime, thus resulting in a red afterglow. The experimental data prove that the doping of Mn2+ not only induces the multiexciton generation (MEG) process of the perovskite, avoiding the energy loss of inorganic excitons, but also promotes the Dexter energy transfer from organic triplet excitons to inorganic excitons, thus realizing the superefficient red&#8208;light emission of Cd2+. This work suggests that guest metal ions can induce host metal ions to realize MEG in 2D bulk OIHPs, which provides a new idea for the development of optoelectronic materials and devices with ultrahigh energy utilization.

         <title>Full Control of Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes for Electrostatic Gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Controlled operation of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating applications is demonstrated via the realization of high&#8208;performance field&#8208;effect transistor, free of the spurious effects caused by electrochemical reactions. The devices exhibit high geometrical capacitances 20&#8202;&#8211;&#8202;50&#8287;&#181;F&#8287;cm&#8722;2\[20--50\:\mu {\rm{F}}\:{\rm{c}}{{\rm{m}}^{ - 2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) enabling the accumulation of electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2, to gate&#8208;induced superconductivity, and to perform ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy.








Abstract
Ionic gating is a powerful technique to realize field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) enabling experiments not possible otherwise. So far, ionic gating has relied on the use of top electrolyte gates, which pose experimental constraints and make device fabrication complex. Promising results obtained recently in FETs based on solid&#8208;state electrolytes remain plagued by spurious phenomena of unknown origin, preventing proper transistor operation, and causing limited control and reproducibility. Here, a class of solid&#8208;state electrolytes for gating (Lithium&#8208;ion conducting glass&#8208;ceramics, LICGCs) is explored, the processes responsible for the spurious phenomena and irreproducible behavior are identified, and properly functioning transistors exhibiting high density ambipolar operation with gate capacitance of &#8776;20&#8202;&#8722;&#8202;50&#8201;&#181;F cm&#8722;2\[20{\bm{ - }}50\;\mu F c{m^{{\bm{ - }}2}}\] (depending on the polarity of the accumulated charges) are demonstrated. Using 2D semiconducting transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides, the ability to implement ionic&#8208;gate spectroscopy to determine the semiconducting bandgap, and to accumulate electron densities above 1014 cm&#8722;2 are demostrated, resulting in gate&#8208;induced superconductivity in MoS2 multilayers. As LICGCs are implemented in a back&#8208;gate configuration, they leave the surface of the material exposed, enabling the use of surface&#8208;sensitive techniques (such as scanning tunneling microscopy and photoemission spectroscopy) impossible so far in ionic&#8208;gated devices. They also allow double ionic gated devices providing independent control of charge density and electric&#160;field.

         <title>Controllable Oxidation of ZrS2 to Prepare High&#8208;&#954;, Single&#8208;Crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 for 2D Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The controllable preparation of ultrathin monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) single crystals (EOT&#8776;0.29 nm, EOT is equivalent oxide thickness) via thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. By using K3[Fe(CN)6] as seeding, the large&#8208;scale parent ZrS2 is easily grown. The grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19 and a breakdown voltage of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. Using m&#8208;ZrO2 as top gate dielectric, the MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) shows excellent device performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;&#954; materials that exhibit large permittivity and band gaps are needed as gate dielectrics to enhance capacitance and prevent leakage current in downsized technology nodes. Among these, monoclinic ZrO2 (m&#8208;ZrO2) shows good potential because of its inertness and high&#8208;&#954; with respect to SiO2, but a method to produce ultrathin single crystal is lacking. Here, the controllable preparation of ultrathin m&#8208;ZrO2 single crystals via the in situ thermal oxidation of ZrS2 is achieved. As&#8208;grown m&#8208;ZrO2 presents an equivalent oxide thickness of &#8776;0.29&#160;nm, a high dielectric constant of &#8776;19, and a breakdown voltage (EBD) of &#8776;7.22 MV cm&#8722;1. MoS2 field effect transistor (FET) by using m&#8208;ZrO2 as a dielectric layer shows comparable mobility to that using SiO2 dielectric. The ultraclean interface of m&#8208;ZrO2/MoS2 and high crystalline quality of m&#8208;ZrO2 lead to negligible hysteresis in transfer curves. Single crystal m&#8208;ZrO2 dielectric shows potential application in digital complementary metal oxidesemiconductor (CMOS) logic FET.

The great potential of the application of room&#8208;temperature in the situ cold bonding technique for the rational design and optimization of LLZ/Li interfaces with low cost, high safety and operability is highlighted. The prepared RT&#8208;MCL shows good interfacial compatibility and excellent electrochemical properties.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li6.4La3Zr1.4Ta0.6O12 (LLZ) electrolyte&#160;is a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries, while its applications are hindered by interfacial problems. Although the utilization of functional coatings and molten lithium (Li) effectively solves the LLZ interfacial compatibility problem with Li metal, it poses problems such as high cost, high danger, and structural damage. Herein, a mixed conductive layer (MCL) is introduced at the LLZ/Li interface (RT&#8208;MCL) via an in situ cold bonding process at room temperature. Such a stable and compact RT&#8208;MCL can effectively suppress side reactions and protect the crystal structure of LLZ, and it also inhibits growth of Li dendrites and promotes uniform Li deposition. The critical current density (CCD) of the Li symmetric cell composed of RT&#8208;MCL&#8208;LLZ is increased to 1.8&#160;mA cm&#8208;2 and provides stable cycling performance over 2000 h under 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8208;2. Additionally, this in situ cold bonding treatment can significantly reduce cost and eliminate potential safety issues caused by the high&#8208;temperature processing of Li metal. This work highlights tremendous potential of this cold bonding technique in the reasonable design and optimization of the LLZ/Li interface.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Changeable Dynamic Conformal Electrode/electrolyte Interlayer enabling Pressure&#8208;Independent Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic conformal interlayer with the reversible phase&#8208;changeable feature is developed. This interlayer (P&#8208;P&#8208;I) comprises PCL polymer skeleton, PC cosolvent, and LiTFSI salt, exhibiting high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S&#160;cm&#8722;1, strong adhesion bonding (250 N pulling&#8208;out resistance), and reversible phase&#8208;change property, disengaging Li&#8208;SSBs from pressure dependence and solving the issue of SSE/Li interfacial morphological degeneration.








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;metal&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries (Li&#8208;SSBs) are one of the most promising energy storage devices due to their high energy densities. However, under insufficient pressure constraints (&lt;MPa&#8208;level), Li&#8208;SSBs usually exhibit poor electrochemical performances owing to the continuous interfacial degradation between the solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) and electrodes. Herein, a phase&#8208;changeable interlayer is developed to construct the self&#8208;adhesive and dynamic conformal electrode/SSE contact in Li&#8208;SSBs. The strong adhesive and cohesive strengths of the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer enable Li&#8208;SSBs to resist up to 250 N pulling force (=1.9&#160;MPa), affording Li&#8208;SSBs ideal interfacial integrality even without extra stack pressure. Remarkably, this interlayer exhibits a high ionic conductivity of 1.3 &#215;&#160;10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1, attributed to the shortened steric solvation hindrance and optimized Li+ coordination structure. Furthermore, the changeable phase property of the interlayer endows Li&#8208;SSBs with a healable Li/SSE interface, accommodating the stress&#8211;strain evolution of the lithium metal and constructing the dynamic conformal interface. Consequently, the contact impedance of the modified solid symmetric cell exhibits a pressure&#8208;independent manner and does not increase over 700&#160;h (0.2&#160;MPa). The LiFePO4 pouch cell with the phase&#8208;changeable interlayer shows 85% capacity retention after 400 cycles at a low pressure of 0.1&#160;MPa.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;fast Piezocatalysts Enabled By Interfacial Interaction of Reduced Graphene Oxide/MoS2 Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rGO&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure (GMH) shows a record&#8208;high piezo&#8208;catalytic degradation rate and can totally degrade the organic dyes within 50 s. The fundamental interfacial phenomena and the charge transfer in GMH are carefully examined by theoretical and experimental methods. It opens a new door for creation of new piezo&#8208;catalysts and toward a deeper understanding of the mechanism of piezo&#8208;catalysis.








Abstract
The catalytic activity has been investigated in 2D materials, and the unique structural and electronic properties contribute to their success in conventional heterogeneous catalysis. Heterojunction&#8208;based piezocatalysis has attracted increasing attention due to the band&#8208;structure engineering and the enhanced charge carrier separation by prominent piezoelectric effect. However, the piezocatalytic behavior of van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures is still unknown, and the finite active sites, catalyst poisoning, and poor conductivity are challenges for developing good piezocatalysts. Herein, a reduced graphene oxide (rGO)&#8208;MoS2 heterostructure is rationally designed to tackle these challenges. The heterostructure shows a record&#8208;high piezocatalytic degradation rate of 1.40 &#215; 102 L mol&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which is 7.86 times higher than MoS2 nanosheets. Piezoresponse force microscope measurements and density functional theory calculation reveal that the coupling between semiconductive and piezoelectric properties in the vdW heterojunction is vital to break the metallic state screening effect at the MoS2 edge for keeping the piezoelectric potential. The dynamic charges generated by MoS2 and the fast charge transfer in rGO activate and maintain catalytically active sites for pollutant degradation with an ultra&#8208;fast rate and good stability. The working mechanism opens new avenues for developing efficient catalysts significant to wastewater treatments and other applications.

         <title>PIP2 Alteration Caused by Elastic Modulus and Tropism of Electrospun Scaffolds Facilitates Altered BMSCs Proliferation and Differentiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high expression of PIP2 on the tropic fibers with low elastic modulus is the main reason for the increased potential of stem cell proliferation and differentiation. The cells on random fibers or high elastic modulus aligned fibers&#160;were&#160;altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to be consistent with cells on low elastic modulus aligned fibers.








Abstract
Aligned submicron fibers have played an essential role in inducing stem cell proliferation and differentiation. In this study, it is aimed to identify the differential causes of stem cell proliferation and differentiation between bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on aligned&#8208;random fibers with different elastic modulus, and to change the differential levels through a regulatory mechanism mediated by B&#8208;cell lymphoma 6 protein(BCL&#8208;6) and miRNA&#8208;126&#8208;5p(miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p). The results showed that phosphatidylinositol(4,5)bisphosphate alterations are found in the aligned fibers compared with the random fibers, which has a regular and oriented structure, excellent cytocompatibility, regular cytoskeleton, and high differentiation potential. The same trend is actual for the aligned fibers with a lower elastic modulus. The level of proliferative differentiation genes in cells is altered by BCL&#8208;6 and miR&#8208;126&#8208;5p mediated regulatory mechanisms to make the cell distribution nearly consistent with the cell state on low elastic modulus aligned fibers. This work demonstrates the reason for the difference of cells between the two kinds of fibers and on fibers with different elastic modulus. These findings provide more insights for understanding the gene&#8208;level regulation of cell growth in tissue engineering.

         <title>Unveiling the Morphological and Physical Mechanism of Burn&#8208;in Loss Alleviation by Ternary Matrix Toward Stable and Efficient All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a high&#8208;efficiency ternary matrix platform for all&#8208;polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo&#8208;physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling&#8208;out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;In a high-efficiency ternary matrix platform for all-polymer solar cells, the operational stability enhancement strategy is proposed with carefully studied underlying reasons, in terms of morphology and photo-physics. Based on the &#8220;canceling-out&#8221; phenomenon, further ternary OPV blend design can be nourished by considering this principle during material combination, which can be useful in boosting both PCE and stability.

         <title>Functional Ultrathin Separators Proactively Stabilizing Zinc Anodes for Zinc&#8208;Based Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators for zinc&#8208;based energy storage are reported. The separators are composed of a high&#8208;strength cellulose nanofiber substrate and a zincophilic sites&#8208;rich decoration layer, in which the former one presents uniform nanoporous structure, ion&#8208;sieving ability, and ultrathin thickness and the latter one possesses high specific surface area and abundant zincophilic sites, and thus can proactively stabilize zinc anodes.








Abstract
Ultrathin separators are indispensable to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but their easy failure caused by zinc dendrites poses a great challenge. Herein, 23&#160;&#181;m&#8208;thick functional ultrathin separators (FUSs), realizing superb electrochemical stability of zinc anodes and outstanding long&#8208;term durability of ultrathin separators, are reported. In the FUSs, an ultrathin but mechanically strong nanoporous membrane substrate benefits fast and flux&#8208;homogenized Zn2+ transport, while a metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposite decoration layer provides rich low&#8208;barrier zinc nucleation sites, thereby synergistically stabilizing zinc anodes to inhibit zinc dendrites and dendrite&#8208;caused separator failure. Investigation of the zinc affinity of the MOF&#8208;derived C/Cu nanocomposites unravels the high zincophilicity of heteroatom&#8208;containing C/Cu interfaces. Zinc anodes coupled with the FUSs present superior electrochemical stability, whose operation lifetime exceeds 2000&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 600&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, 40&#8211;50 times longer than that of the zinc anodes using glass&#8208;fiber separators. The reliability of the FUSs in ZIBs and zinc&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitors is also validated. This work proposes a new strategy to stabilize zinc anodes and provides theoretical guidance in developing ultrathin separators for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based energy storage.

         <title>Dynamic Reconstitution Between Copper Single Atoms and Clusters for Electrocatalytic Urea Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate emerges to meet comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. Herein, the urea synthesis catalyzed by Cu1&#8211;CeO2 is reported. The dynamic reversible reconstitution of the catalyst configuration is monitored using operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra and the Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Transform of clusters back to single&#8208;atom configurations occurs when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic C&#63743;N coupling between carbon dioxide and nitrate has emerged to meet the comprehensive demands of carbon footprint closing, valorization of waste, and sustainable manufacture of urea. However, the identification of catalytic active sites and the design of efficient electrocatalysts remain a challenge. Herein, the synthesis of urea catalyzed by copper single atoms decorated on a CeO2 support (denoted as Cu1&#8211;CeO2) is reported. The catalyst exhibits an average urea yield rate of 52.84&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 gcat.&#8722;1 at &#8722;1.6&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode. Operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectra demonstrate the reconstitution of copper single atoms (Cu1) to clusters (Cu4) during electrolysis. These electrochemically reconstituted Cu4 clusters are real active sites for electrocatalytic urea synthesis. Favorable C&#63743;N coupling reactions and urea formation on Cu4 are validated using operando synchrotron&#8208;radiation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Dynamic and reversible transformations of clusters to single&#8208;atom configurations occur when the applied potential is switched to an open&#8208;circuit potential, endowing the catalyst with superior structural and electrochemical stabilities.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Photothermal&#8208;Therapy&#8208;Assisted Immunomodulation via Multiresponsive Adjuvant Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pH&#8208;enzyme&#8208;near&#8208;infrared multi&#8208;responsive immune&#8208;adjuvant nanoparticle is fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy and photothermal&#8208;assisted manipulation of immune cells including dendritic cells, macrophages, and T cells for effective treatment of malignant tumor, which significantly inhibits the primary tumor and its metastasis, resulting in the dramatic enhancement of survival rate of lung metastatic tumor&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Multiresponsive adjuvant nanoparticles (RMmAGL) are fabricated to perform tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy while regulating the behavior of tumor&#8208;associated immune cells for primary tumor eradication and metastasis inhibition. Core&#8211;satellite&#8208;like RMmAGL have a core of mannose&#8208;functionalized mesoporous silica nanoparticles loaded with the TLR7 agonist imiquimod (R837@MSN&#8208;mannose) connected via hydrazone bonds to satellites of glutamine (Glu)&#8208; and lysine (Lys)&#8208;comodified gold nanoparticles (AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys). During therapy, the acidic environment in tumor tissue cleaves the hydrazone bonds to release AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys, which further accumulate in tumor cells. After internalization, photothermal agents (aggregated AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys) are generated in situ through the intratumoral enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction between Glu and Lys, resulting in tumor&#8208;specific photothermal therapy. The detachment of AuNPs&#8208;Glu/Lys also triggers the release of R837, which matured dendritic cells (DCs) via a vaccine&#8208;like mechanism along with the tumor&#8208;associated antigens generated by photothermal therapy. These matured DCs further activates surrounding T cells for immunotherapy. Moreover, the resulting free MSN&#8208;mannose serves as an artificial glycocalyx to continuously induce the polarization of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages from an immunosuppressive phenotype to an inflammatory phenotype, thus further enhancing immunotherapy. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrate significant inhibition of malignant tumors after therapy.

         <title>Intrinsic Dipole Arrangement to Coordinate Energy Levels for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top&#8208;down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.








Abstract
Despite great progress in perovskite photovoltaics, it should be noted that the intrinsic disorder dipolar cations in organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid perovskites exert negative effects on the energy band structure as well as the carrier separation and transfer dynamics. However, oriented polarization achieved by applying an external electric field may cause irreversible damage to perovskites. Herein, a unique and efficient strategy is developed to modulate the intrinsic dipole arrangement in perovskite films for high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The spontaneous reorientation of dipolar cation methylamine is triggered by a polar molecule, constructing a vertical polarization during crystallization regulation. The oriented dipole determines a gradient energy&#8208;level arrangement in PSCs and more favorable energetics at interfaces, effectively enhancing the built&#8208;in electric field and suppressing the nonradiative recombination. Besides, the dipole reorientation induces a local dielectric environment to remarkably reduce exciton binding energy, leading to an ultralong carrier diffusion length of up to 1708&#160;nm. Accordingly, the n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs achieve a significant increase in power conversion efficiency, reaching 24.63% with negligible hysteresis and exhibiting outstanding stabilities. This strategy also provides a facile route to eliminate the mismatched energetics and enhance carrier dynamics for other novel photovoltaic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The ordered arrangement of methylamine dipoles is induced by the polar molecule to form a top-down macroscopic polarization of the film. Reorientation of dipoles contributes to forming a gradient energy band and changes the surrounding dielectric environment, facilitating efficient separation and directional transport of carriers. The photoelectric conversion efficiency and stability of the perovskite solar cells are significantly improved.

         <title>A Heteroanionic Zinc Ion Conductor for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heteroanionic compound (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx, ZOF) with an aliovalent F&#8208;doped wurtzite motif shows selective Zn2+ conductivity to regulate zinc migration and deposition. ZOF@Zn anode exhibits a low overpotential of 13.3&#160;mV at 0.2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 in symmetric cells, and high stability of 169.7&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 in MnO2//Zn full batteries for 1000 cycles.








Abstract
Although zinc&#8208;based batteries are promising candidates for eco&#8208;friendly and cost&#8208;effective energy storage devices, their performance is severely retarded by dendrite formation. As the simplest zinc compounds, zinc chalcogenides, and halides are individually applied as a Zn protection layer due to high zinc ion conductivity. However, the mixed&#8208;anion compounds are not studied, which constrains the Zn2+ diffusion in single&#8208;anion lattices to their own limits. A heteroanionic zinc ion conductor (ZnyO1&#8722;xFx) coating layer is designed by in situ growth method with tunable F content and thickness. Strengthened by F aliovalent doping, the Zn2+ conductivity is enhanced within the wurtzite motif for rapid lattice Zn migration. ZnyO1&#8722;xFx also affords zincophilic sites for oriented superficial Zn plating to suppress dendrite growth. Therefore, ZnyO1&#8722;xFx&#8208;coated anode exhibits a low overpotential of 20.4&#160;mV for 1000&#160;h cycle life at a plating capacity of 1.0&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;cm&#8722;2 during symmetrical cell test. The MnO2//Zn full battery further proves high stability of 169.7 mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 for 1000 cycles. This work may enlighten the mixed&#8208;anion tuning for high&#8208;performance Zn&#8208;based energy storage devices.

         <title>Chelated Ion&#8208;Exchange Strategy toward BiOCl Mesoporous Single&#8208;Crystalline Nanosheets for Boosting Photocatalytic Selective Aromatic Alcohols Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is proposed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) with ultra&#8208;thin structure by chelating interaction of Bi3+ ions and acetate ions, and ion exchange between Cl&#8722; ions and acetate ions. The prepared BiOCl MSCN exhibits excellent photocatalytic activity stability and general adaptability for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde.








Abstract
The photoresponse and photocatalytic efficiency of bismuth oxychloride (BiOCl) are greatly limited by rapid recombination of photogenerated carriers. The construction of porous single&#8208;crystal BiOCl photocatalyst can effectively alleviate this issue and provide accessible active sites. Herein, a facile chelated ion&#8208;exchange strategy is developed to synthesize BiOCl mesoporous single&#8208;crystalline nanosheets (BiOCl MSCN) using acetic acid and ammonia solution respectively as chelating agent and ionization promoter. The strong chelation between acetate ions and Bi3+ ions introduces acetate ions into the precipitated product to exchange with Cl&#8208; ions, resulting in large lattice mismatch, strain release, and formation of void&#8208;like mesopores. The prepared BiOCl MSCN photocatalyst exhibits excellent catalytic performance with 99% conversion and 98% selectivity for oxidation of benzyl alcohol to benzaldehyde and superior general adaptability for various aromatic alcohols. The theoretical calculations and characterizations confirm that the superior performance is mainly attributed to the abundant oxygen vacancies, plenty of accessible adsorption/active sites and fast charge transport path without grain boundaries.

         <title>Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 Nanosheets for Ultrasound&#8208;Triggered and Mitochondria&#8208;Targeted Piezodynamic Cancer Therapy Synergized with Energy Metabolism&#8208;Targeted Chemotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
Piezocatalytic 2D WS2 nanosheets are developed for efficient cancer treatment via ultrasound&#8208;triggered piezodynamic cancer therapy. 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondrial&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium to significantly enhance their anticancer efficacy via mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic therapy. FX11, a potent glycolysis inhibitor that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism, is loaded into WS2 nanosheets to synergistically potentiate the piezodynamic cancer therapy.








Abstract
Piezoelectric nanomaterials that can generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) by piezoelectric polarization under an external mechanical force have emerged as an effective platform for cancer therapy. In this study, piezoelectric 2D WS2 nanosheets are functionalized with mitochondria&#8208;targeting triphenylphosphonium (TPP) for ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered, mitochondria&#8208;targeted piezodynamic cancer therapy. In addition, a glycolysis inhibitor (FX11) that can inhibit cellular energy metabolism is loaded into TPP&#8208; and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)&#8208;conjugated WS2 nanosheet (TPEG&#8208;WS2) to potentiate its therapeutic efficacy. Upon US irradiation, the sono&#8208;excited electrons and holes generated in the WS2 are efficiently separated by piezoelectric polarization, which subsequently promotes the production of ROS. FX11&#8208;loaded&#160;TPEG&#8208;WS2 (FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2)&#160;selectively accumulates in the mitochondria of human breast cancer cells. In addition, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively inhibits the&#160;production of adenosine triphosphate . Thus, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 exhibits outstanding anticancer effects under US irradiation. An in vivo study using tumor&#8208;xenograft mice demonstrates that FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 effectively accumulated in the tumors. Its&#160;tumor accumulation is visualized using in vivo computed tomography . Notably, FX11@TPEG&#8208;WS2 with US irradiation remarkably suppresses the tumor growth of mice without systemic toxicity. This study demonstrates that the combination of piezodynamic therapy and energy metabolism&#8208;targeted chemotherapy using mitochondria&#8208;targeting 2D WS2 is a novel strategy for the selective and effective treatment of tumors.

         <title>Perovskite Grain&#8208;Boundary Manipulation Using Room&#8208;Temperature Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing &#8220;Ligaments&#8221; for Developing Highly Stable Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.8% Efficiency</title>

         <dc:description>
Grain&#8208;boundary &#8220;ligaments&#8221; are developed to endow fragile perovskite grain boundaries with toughness, water resistance, and room temperature self&#8208;healing properties. Meanwhile, they can also passivate the defects and release the residual tensile strain in perovskite films. The resultant flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a record 23.84% power conversion efficiency and robust mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) are the best candidates to complement traditional silicon SCs in portable power applications. However, their mechanical, operational, and ambient stabilities are still unable to meet the practical demands because of the natural brittleness, residual tensile strain, and high defect density along the perovskite grain boundaries. To overcome these issues, a cross&#8208;linkable monomer TA&#8208;NI with dynamic covalent disulfide bonds, H&#8208;bonds, and ammonium is carefully developed. The cross&#8208;linking acts as &#8220;ligaments&#8221; attached on the perovskite grain boundaries. These &#8220;ligaments&#8221; consisting of elastomers and 1D perovskites can not only passivate the grain boundaries and enhance moisture resistance but also release the residual tensile strain and mechanical stress in 3D perovskite films. More importantly, the elastomer can repair bending&#8208;induced mechanical cracks in the perovskite film because of dynamic self&#8208;healing characteristics. The resultant flexible pero&#8208;SCs exhibit promising improvements in efficiency, and record values (23.84% and 21.66%) are obtained for 0.062&#160;and 1.004&#160;cm2&#160;devices; the flexible devices also show overall improved stabilities with T90&#160;&gt;20&#160;000&#160;bending cycles, operational stability with T90&#160;&gt;1248&#160;h, and ambient stability (relative humidity&#160;=&#160;30%) with T90&#160;&gt;3000&#160;h. This strategy paves a new way for the industrial&#8208;scale development of high&#8208;performance flexible pero&#8208;SCs.

         <title>Genetically Engineering Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated BTO Nanoparticles for MMP2&#8208;Activated Piezocatalysis&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell membrane expressed &#945;PD&#8208;L1 with MMP2 responsive shielding domain is engineered to coat on BTO NPs, the resulting M@BTO NPs generate ROS and O2 to induce immunogenic cell death under ultrasound induced piezocatalysis, effectively switching &#8220;immune&#8208;cold&#8221; tumors to &#8220;immune&#8208;hot&#8221; tumors while achieving specific immune checkpoint blockade, providing a robust stimuli&#8208;responsive bioengineering system for augmenting tumor immunotherapy.








Abstract
Tumor immunotherapy based on immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) still suffers from low host response rate and non&#8208;specific distribution of immune checkpoint inhibitors, greatly compromising the therapeutic efficiency. Herein, cellular membrane stably expressing matrix metallopeptidase 2 (MMP2)&#8208;activated PD&#8208;L1 blockades is engineered to coat ultrasmall barium titanate (BTO) nanoparticle for overcoming the immunosuppressive microenvironment of tumors. The resulting M@BTO NPs can significantly promote the BTO's tumor accumulation, while the masking domains on membrane PD&#8208;L1 antibodies are cleaved when exposure to MMP2 highly expressed in tumor. With ultrasound (US)&#160;irradiation, M@BTO NPs can simultaneously generate reactive oxygen species (ROS) and O2 based on BTO mediated piezocatalysis and water splitting, significantly promoting the intratumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and improving the PD&#8208;L1 blockade therapy to the tumor, resulting in effective tumor growth inhibition and lung metastasis suppression in a melanoma mouse model. This nanoplatform combines MMP2&#8208;activated genetic editing cell membrane with US responsive BTO for both immune stimulation and specific PD&#8208;L1 inhibition, providing a safe and robust strategy in enhancing immune response against tumor.

         <title>Durable and Adjustable Interfacial Engineering of Polymeric Electrolytes for Both Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Cathodes and High&#8208;Energy Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With surface in situ polymerization technology, solid polymeric ether&#8208;based electrolytes containing sulfonimide&#8208;based salts are designed as a high&#8208;performance cathode coating, enabling the durable compatibility with both Ni&#8208;rich LiNixCoyMnzO2 cathodes and metallic anodes, accompanying with anticorrosion of aluminum current collectors. This novel interface with high&#8208;voltage tolerance and adjustable components provides a new strategy toward long&#8208;term cyclability of high&#8208;voltage metal batteries.








Abstract
Achieving stable cycling of high&#8208;voltage solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries is crucial for next&#8208;generation rechargeable batteries with high energy density and high safety. However, the complicated interface problems in both cathode/anode electrodes preclude their practical applications hitherto. Herein, to simultaneously solve such interfacial limitations and obtain sufficient Li+ conductivity in the electrolyte, an ultrathin and adjustable interface is developed at the cathode side through a convenient surface in situ polymerization (SIP), achieving a durable high&#8208;voltage tolerance and Li&#8208;dendrite inhibition. The integrated interfacial engineering fabricates a homogeneous solid electrolyte with optimized interfacial interactions that contributes to tame the interfacial compatibility between LiNixCoyMnzO2 and polymeric electrolyte accompanied by anticorrosion of aluminum current collector. Further, the SIP enables a uniform adjustment of solid electrolyte composition by dissolving additives such as Na+ and K+ salts, which presents prominent cyclability in symmetric Li cells (&gt;300 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2). The assembled LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (4.3 V)||Li batteries show excellent cycle life with high Coulombic efficiencies (&gt;99%). This SIP strategy is also investigated and verified in sodium metal batteries. It opens a new frontier for solid electrolytes toward high&#8208;voltage and high&#8208;energy metal battery technologies.

         <title>A Nonswelling Hydrogel with Regenerable High Wet Tissue Adhesion for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonswelling hydrogels with regenerable high wet tissue adhesion are fabricated. Subsequently, neural microelectrode arrays and rapid&#8208;response strain sensors are integrated into the hydrogel to fabricate bifunctional tissue&#8208;interface bioelectronics. Additionally, these bioelectronics possess excellent electrical properties. Electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyography (EMG), and tissue movement information are accurately recorded by the bioelectronics, and tissue fatigue is successfully monitored.








Abstract
Reducing the swelling of tissue&#8208;adhesive hydrogels is crucial for maintaining stable tissue adhesion and inhibiting tissue inflammation. However, reported strategies for reducing swelling always result in a simultaneous decrease in the tissue adhesive strength of the hydrogel. Furthermore, once the covalent bonds break in the currently reported hydrogels, they cannot be rebuilt, and the hydrogel loses its tissue adhesive ability. In this work, a nonswelling hydrogel (named as &#8220;PAACP&#8221;) possessing regenerable high tissue adhesion is synthesized by copolymerizing and crosslinking poly(vinyl butyral) with acrylic acid, gelatin, and chitosan&#8208;grafted N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine. The tissue adhesive strength of the obtained PAACP reaches 211.4&#160;kPa, which is approximately ten times higher than that of the reported nonswelling hydrogels, and the hydrogel can be reused for multiple cycles. The as&#8208;prepared hydrogel shows great potential in soft bioelectronics, as muscle fatigue is successfully monitored via the electrode array and strain sensor integrated on PAACP substrates. The success of these bioelectronics offers potential applicability in the long&#8208;term diagnosis of muscle&#8208;related health conditions and prosthetic manipulations.

         <title>13% Single&#8208;Component Organic Solar Cells based on Double&#8208;Cable Conjugated Polymers with Pendent Y&#8208;Series Acceptors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Regular and random double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent Y&#8208;series acceptors are designed and synthesized, in which the random copolymer provides a high efficiency of 13.02% compared to the regular polymer with an efficiency of 2.75% in single&#8208;component organic solar cells.








Abstract
Double&#8208;cable conjugated polymers with pendent electron acceptors, including fullerene, rylene diimides, and nonfused acceptors, have been developed for application in single&#8208;component organic solar cells (SCOSCs) with efficiencies approaching 10%. In this work, Y&#8208;series electron acceptors have been firstly incorporated into double&#8208;cable polymers in order to further improve the efficiencies of SCOSCs. A highly crystalline Y&#8208;series acceptor based on quinoxaline core and the random copolymerized strategy are used to optimize the ambipolar charge transport&#160;and the nanophase separation of the double&#8208;cable polymers. As a result, an efficiency of 13.02% is obtained in the random double&#8208;cable polymer, representing the highest performance in SCOSCs, while the regular double&#8208;cable polymer only provides a low efficiency of 2.75%. The significantly enhanced efficiencies are attributed to higher charge carrier mobilities, better ordering conjugated backbones and Y&#8208;series acceptors in random double&#8208;cable polymers.

Soft Robotics
Wormlike robots can navigate through uneven terrain and constricted spaces, but it has proved difficult to completely avoid rigid components, limiting the compliance of such machines. In article 2210409, Hillel J. Chiel, Roger D. Quinn, Christoph Weder, Kathryn A. Daltorio, and co&#8208;workers report an earthworm&#8208;inspired robot that is based on soft polymer actuators. The robot moves through peristaltic locomotion and can wiggle itself through small openings.

Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production
In article number 2207765, Megalamane Siddaramappa Bootharaju, Jong Suk Yoo, Nanfeng Zheng, Taeghwan Hyeon, and co&#8208;workers show how gold doping selectively at the core of a 44&#8208;atom silver nanocluster can modulate the electronic structure and enhance the stability of the resulting gold&#8211;silver core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;nanostructure through synergistic effects. Increased interfacial charge transfer due to a favorably modified band alignment makes the core&#8211;shell nanocluster a promising cocatalyst for hydrogen generation from solar water splitting.

Artificial Fingertips
Human fingertips with intricate structures and delicate perspiration system help people in gripping, climbing, or even more complex activities. In article number 2209729, Dirk J. Broer, Danqing Liu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of a coating made of cholesteric liquid crystal networks to mimic not only the unique fingerprint topography but also the liquid secretion in human fingertips. The biomimetic perspiration of the coating is reversible, as controlled by light, which can be used to fine&#8208;tune the surface tribological property. The performance of this material shows its potential to be applied for robotic devices.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanically stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) is crucial for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries. This review summarizes the desirable mechanical properties of SEI, mechanical characterization methods, and previous optimization attempts. Inconsistencies in these efforts are clarified and the causes are explored. A research protocol is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.








Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behavior many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches are adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions are generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. Here, the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy are outlined. Previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties are also scrutinized, inconsistencies in these efforts are elucidated, and the underlying causes are explored. Finally, a set of research protocols is proposed to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Small&#8208;Scale Robotics with Tailored Wettability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising tools in a variety of biomedical, sensing, and decontamination applications. The review encompasses the basic understanding, theory, and up&#8208;to&#8208;date developments related to SSRs with tailored wettabilities, ranging from hydrophilic to hydrophobic.








Abstract
Small&#8208;scale robots (SSRs) have emerged as promising and versatile tools in various biomedical, sensing, decontamination, and manipulation applications, as they are uniquely capable of performing tasks at small length scales. With the miniaturization of robots from the macroscale to millimeter&#8208;, micrometer&#8208;, and nanometer&#8208;scales, the viscous and surface forces, namely adhesive forces and surface tension have become dominant. These forces significantly impact motion efficiency. Surface engineering of robots with both hydrophilic and hydrophobic functionalization presents a brand&#8208;new pathway to overcome motion resistance and enhance the ability to target and regulate robots for various tasks. This review focuses on the current progress and future perspectives of SSRs with hydrophilic and hydrophobic modifications (including both tethered and untethered robots). The study emphasizes the distinct advantages of SSRs, such as improved maneuverability and reduced drag forces, and outlines their potential applications. With continued innovation, rational surface engineering is expected to endow SSRs with exceptional mobility and functionality, which can broaden their applications, enhance their penetration depth, reduce surface fouling, and inhibit bacterial adhesion.

         <title>Gate Dielectrics Integration for 2D Electronics: Challenges, Advances, and Outlook</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 18, May 4, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high&#8208;performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high&#8208;&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next&#8208;generation nanoelectronics.








Abstract
2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond&#8208;silicon field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high&#8208;performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.

&lt;p&gt;This review summarizes the recent development of dielectrics for high-performance 2D devices. Adapting integration protocols of conventional high-&#954; dielectrics and emerging dielectrics with inert surface can significantly improve the dielectric film and interface quality. The advancement of novel dielectrics boosts overall performance of 2D devices and paves way toward next-generation nanoelectronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D semiconductors have emerged both as an ideal platform for fundamental studies and as promising channel materials in beyond-silicon field-effect-transistors due to their outstanding electrical properties and exceptional tunability via external field. However, the lack of proper dielectrics for 2D semiconductors has become a major roadblock for their further development toward practical applications. The prominent issues between conventional 3D dielectrics and 2D semiconductors arise from the integration and interface quality, where defect states and imperfections lead to dramatic deterioration of device performance. In this review article, the root causes of such issues are briefly analyzed and recent advances on some possible solutions, including various approaches of adapting conventional dielectrics to 2D semiconductors, and the development of novel dielectrics with van der Waals surface toward high-performance 2D electronics are summarized. Then, in the perspective, the requirements of ideal dielectrics for state-of-the-art 2D devices are outlined and an outlook for their future development is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Hardware and Information Security Primitives Based on 2D Materials and Devices</title>

         <dc:description>
A review of hardware security solutions using novel electronics, optical, and material properties of 2D materials and their corresponding heterostructure device configurations for Internet of Things platforms. The five quintessential security domains for discussion are physically unclonable functions, true random number generators, logic locking, hardware watermarking and anticounterfeiting, and hardware camouflaging.








Abstract
Hardware security is a major concern for the entire semiconductor ecosystem that accounts for billions of dollars in annual losses. Similarly, information security is a critical need for the rapidly proliferating edge devices that continuously collect and communicate a massive volume of data. While silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor technology offers security solutions, these are largely inadequate, inefficient, and often inconclusive, as well as resource intensive in time, energy, and cost, leading to tremendous room for innovation in this field. Furthermore, silicon&#8208;based security primitives have shown vulnerability to machine learning (ML) attacks. In recent years, 2D materials such as graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides have been intensely explored to mitigate these security challenges. In this review, 2D&#8208;materials&#8208;based hardware security solutions such as camouflaging, true random number generation, watermarking, anticounterfeiting, physically unclonable functions, and logic locking of integrated circuits (ICs) are summarized with accompanying discussion on their reliability and resilience to ML attacks. In addition, the role of native defects in 2D materials in developing high entropy hardware security primitives is also examined. Finally, the existing challenges for 2D materials, which must be overcome for large&#8208;scale deployment of 2D ICs to meet the security needs of the semiconductor industry, are discussed.

         <title>Excimer&#8208;Mediated Ultrafast Intermolecular Nonradiative Decay Enables Giant Photothermal Performance for Optimized Phototheranostic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing organic photothermal materials (OPMs) with high photothermal performance for phototheranostic mainly focus on the manipulation of intramolecular nonradiative (intraNR) decay, which often requires quite complicated and time&#8208;consuming molecular engineering. In addition to intraNR decay, intermolecular nonradiative (interNR) decay is equally important and more convenient in governing photothermal performance. However, controlling interNR decay remains challenging due to the limited understanding of their origin and dynamics. Here, systemic investigation of intraNR and interNR decay directs the first demonstration of simple manipulation of interNR decay to produce a giant photothermal performance for optimized phototheranostic. Among three designed polymers with varying fluorine substitution, structure&#8208;performance studies reveal a dimer&#8208;initiated interNR decay to improve photothermal performance. Dimer is formed by intermolecular C&#8208;F&#183;&#183;&#183;H hydrogen bond. This finding inspires a simple aggregation control strategy to form excited dimer, namely excimer. It initiates an approximately 100&#8208;fold enhancement in interNR decay rate over conventional intraNR decay to produce ultrahigh photothermal conversion efficiency of 81% for efficient photoacoustic imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy in vivo. This study provides insights into interNR decay in achieving a giant photothermal effect and paves a convenient way to develop high&#8208;performance OPMs.

         <title>Unveiling Strong Ion&#8211;Electron&#8211;Lattice Coupling and Electronic Antidoping in Hydrogenated Perovskite Nickelate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation at the atomic scale and the energy band structure in perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 are demonstrated by combining experimental results and theoretical calculations.&#160;The results show extremely enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation and giant lattice expansion. Moreover, the electronic antidoping mechansim is found to dominate the metal&#8211;insulator transtion, contrary to the previously proposed redox reaction mechanism from Ni3+ to Ni2+.








Abstract
Despite being highly promising for applications in emergent electronic devices, decoding both the ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated materials at the atomic scale and the electronic band structure remains a big challenge due to the strong and complex correlation among these degrees of freedom. Here, taking an epitaxial thin film of perovskite nickelate NdNiO3 as a model system, hydrogen&#8208;ion&#8208;induced giant lattice distortion and enhanced NiO6 octahedra tilting/rotation are demonstrated, which leads to a new robust hydrogenated HNdNiO3 phase with lattice expansion larger than 10% on a series of substrates. Moreover, under the effect of ion&#8211;electron synergistic doping, it is found that the proposed electronic antidoping, i.e., the doped electrons mainly fill the ground&#8208;state oxygen 2p holes instead of changing the Ni oxidation state from Ni3+ to Ni2+, dominates the metal&#8211;insulator transition. Meanwhile, lattice modification with enhanced Ni&#8211;O&#8211;Ni bond tilting or rotation mainly modifies the orbital density of states near the Fermi level. Last, by electric&#8208;field&#8208;controlled hydrogen&#8208;ion intercalation and its strong coupling to the lattice and electron charge, selective micrometer&#8208;scale patterns with distinct structural and electronic states are fabricated. The results provide direct evidence for a strong ion&#8211;electron&#8211;lattice coupling in correlated physics and exhibit its potential applications in designing novel materials and devices.

         <dc:description>
Selective catalysis based on metal complexes is proposed for optimizing liquid&#8208;involving reactions in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Through size screening of the ligand, the CuL can selectively accelerate the rate&#8208;limiting step of Li2S4 to Li2S2/Li2S on the premise of the catalytic efficiency of each step, thereby achieving long cycle lifespan under high sulfur loading and high current density.








Abstract
The practical viability of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries stipulates the use of a high&#8208;loading cathode and lean electrolyte. However, under such harsh conditions, the liquid&#8211;solid sulfur redox reaction is much retarded due to the poor sulfur and polysulfides utilization, leading to low capacity and fast fading. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled macrocyclic Cu(II) complex (CuL) is designed as an effective catalyst to homogenize and maximize the liquid&#8208;involving reaction. The Cu(II) ion coordinated with four N atoms features a planar dsp2${\mathrm{d}}_{{\mathrm{sp}}^{2}}$ hybridization, showing a strong bonding affinity toward lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) along the dz2${\mathrm{d}}_{{z}^{2}}$ orbital via steric effects. Such a structure not only lowers the energy barrier of the liquid&#8211;solid conversion (Li2S4 to Li2S2) but also guides a 3D deposition of Li2S2/Li2S. As such, with a 1&#160;wt% electrolyte additive of CuL, a high initial capacity of 925&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 and areal capacity of 9.62&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 with a low decay of 0.3%/cycle can be achieved under a high sulfur loading of 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 and low electrolyte/sulfur ratio of 6&#160;&#181;L&#160;mgs&#8722;1. This work is expected to inspire the design of homogenous catalysts and accelerate the uptake of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Molecular Locking with All&#8208;Organic Surface Modifiers Enables Stable and Efficient Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated Methyl&#8208;Ammonium&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Modules</title>

A hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers to achieve an active area efficiency of 19.28% (58.5&#160;cm2) with the retention of &#8776;80% efficiency after 7500&#160;h (313 days).








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is now over 19%, but issues with their stability persist owing to significant intrinsic point defects and a mass of surface imperfections introduced during the fabrication process. Herein, the utilization of a hydrophobic all&#8208;organic salt is reported to modify the top surface of large&#8208;area slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated methylammonium (MA)&#8208;free halide perovskite layers. Bearing two molecules, each of which is endowed with anchoring groups capable of exhibiting secondary interactions with the perovskite surfaces, the organic salt acts as a molecular lock by effectively binding to both anion and cation vacancies, substantially enhancing the materials&#8217; intrinsic stability against different stimuli. It not only reduces the ingression of external species such as oxygen and moisture, but also suppresses the egress of volatile organic components during the thermal stability testing. The treated PSCs demonstrate efficiency of 19.28% (active area of 58.5&#160;cm2) and 17.62% (aperture area of 64&#160;cm2) for the corresponding mini&#8208;module. More importantly, unencapsulated slot&#8208;die&#8208;coated mini&#8208;modules incorporating the all&#8208;organic surface modifier show &#8776;80% efficiency retention after 7500&#160;h (313 days) of storage under 30% relative humidity (RH). They also remarkably retain more than 90% of the initial efficiency for over 850&#160;h while being measured continuously.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot, Three&#8208;Phase Recycling of Metals from Li&#8208;Ion Batteries in Rotating, Concentric&#8208;Liquid Reactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal mixtures from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries are rapidly and selectively separated one&#8208;pot in a rotating, concentric&#8208;liquid reactor. In this reactor, vigorous stirring at interfacial regions does not cause mixing of the aqueous metal&#8208;feed and acceptor layers, while the organic extractants are allowed to shuttle between these layers multiple times.








Abstract
Efficient recycling of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) is essential for making their numerous applications sustainable. Hydrometallurgy&#8208;based separation methods are an indispensable part of the recycling process but remain limited by the extraction efficiency and selectivity, and typically require numerous binary liquid&#8211;liquid extraction steps in which the capacity of the extracting organic phase or partition coefficient of extracted metals become an overall bottleneck. Herein, rotating reactors are described, in which the aqueous feed, organic extractant, and aqueous acceptor phases are all present in the same rotating vessel and can be vigorously stirred and emulsified without the coalescence of aqueous layers. In this arrangement, the extractant molecules are not equilibrated with the feed and, instead, &#8220;shuttle&#8221; between the feed/extractant and the extractant/acceptor interfaces multiple times, with each such molecule ultimately transferring approximately ten metal ions. This shuttling allows for using extractant concentrations much lower than in previous designs even for extremely concentrated feeds and, simultaneously, ensures unprecedented speed and selectivity of the one&#8208;pot processes. These experimental results are accompanied by theoretical considerations of the selectivity versus speed trends as well as discussion of parameters essential for system upscaling.

         <title>Recruiting T&#8208;Cells toward the Brain for Enhanced Glioblastoma Immunotherapeutic Efficacy by Co&#8208;Delivery of Cytokines and Immune Checkpoint Antibodies with Macrophage&#8208;Membrane&#8208;Camouflaged Nanovesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanovesicles with a macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane, co&#8208;delivering chemoattractant CXCL10 and immune checkpoint inhibitor aPD&#8208;L1 to orthotopic glioblastoma multiforme (GBM), are developed to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy efficacy. This work provides a paradigm for GBM immunotherapy that enhances brain accumulation of aPD&#8208;L1 and avoids the negative impact of the immunosuppressive microenvironment of malignant tumors.








Abstract
Immunotherapy with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) shows promising prospects for glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) but with restricted results, mainly attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) and the limited antibody permeability of the blood&#8211;tumor barrier (BTB) in GBM. Here, nanovesicles with a&#160;macrophage&#8208;mimicking membrane are described, that co&#8208;deliver&#160;chemotactic CXC chemokine ligand 10 (CXCL10), to pre&#8208;activate the immune microenvironment, and anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 antibody (aPD&#8208;L1), to interrupt the immune checkpoint, aiming to enhance the effect of GBM immunotherapy. Consequently, the tumor tropism of the macrophage membrane and the receptor&#8208;mediated transcytosis of the angiopep&#8208;2 peptide allow&#160;the nanovesicle to effectively cross the BTB and target the GBM region, with 19.75&#8208;fold higher accumulation of antibodies compared to the free aPD&#8208;L1 group. The CPI therapeutic efficacy is greatly enhanced by CXCL10&#8208;induced T&#8208;cells recruitment with significant expansion of CD8+ T&#8208;cells and effector memory T&#8208;cells, leading to the elimination of tumor, prolonged survival time, and long&#8208;term immune memory in orthotopic GBM mice. The nanovesicles, that relieve the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment by CXCL10 to enhance aPD&#8208;L1 efficacy, may present a promising strategy for brain&#8208;tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of 2D Mo2C and Thickness&#8208;Dependent Hydrogen Evolution on Its Basal Plane and Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel self&#8208;templating synthesis method is presented with molten&#8208;salt protection to synthesize high&#8208;quality few&#8208;atoms&#8208;thin Mo2C nanosheets with a low concentration of defects. The fundamental electrochemical properties of the 2D Mo2C nanosheets show that the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Mo2C increases with decreasing thickness.








Abstract
2D transition metal carbides (2D TMCs and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. However, producing high&#8208;quality, large 2D flakes of Mo2C MXene has been challenging. Here, a new salt&#8208;assisted templating approach is reported that enables the direct synthesis of 2D Mo2C with low defect concentrations. KCl acts as a template to form an intermediate 2D product, facilitating Mo2C formation without coarsening upon melting. The thickness of the flakes produced can range from monolayer (0.36 nm) to 10 layers (4.55 nm), and the electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Mo2C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The monolayer Mo2C shows remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8776;6800 mA cm&#8722;2 at 470 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultrahigh turnover frequency of &#8776;17 500 s&#8722;1. This salt&#8208;assisted synthesis approach can also produce WC and V8C7 nanosheets, expanding the family of 2D carbides. The new pathway eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors, making it a versatile approach to direct synthesis of MXene&#8208;like 2D carbides.

     alt="Scalable Synthesis of 2D Mo2C and Thickness-Dependent Hydrogen Evolution on Its Basal Plane and Edges"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A novel self-templating synthesis method is presented with molten-salt protection to synthesize high-quality few-atoms-thin Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanosheets with a low concentration of defects. The fundamental electrochemical properties of the 2D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C nanosheets show that the electrocatalytic activity of 2D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C increases with decreasing thickness.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal carbides (2D TMCs and MXenes) are promising candidates for applications of energy storage and catalysis. However, producing high-quality, large 2D flakes of Mo2C MXene has been challenging. Here, a new salt-assisted templating approach is reported that enables the direct synthesis of 2D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C with low defect concentrations. KCl acts as a template to form an intermediate 2D product, facilitating Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C formation without coarsening upon melting. The thickness of the flakes produced can range from monolayer (0.36 nm) to 10 layers (4.55 nm), and the electrocatalytical hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of 2D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C is inversely proportional to its thickness. The monolayer Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C shows remarkable HER performance with a current density of &#8776;6800 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 470 mV versus reversible hydrogen electrode and an ultrahigh turnover frequency of &#8776;17 500 s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This salt-assisted synthesis approach can also produce WC and V&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets, expanding the family of 2D carbides. The new pathway eliminates the need for layered ceramic precursors, making it a versatile approach to direct synthesis of MXene-like 2D carbides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Excited Spin Wave Fractal Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions exhibit unique, technologically relevant pseudo&#8208;particle behaviors which arise from their topological protection, including well&#8208;defined, three&#8208;dimensional dynamic modes that occur at microwave frequencies. During dynamic excitation, spin waves are ejected into the interstitial regions between skyrmions, creating&#160;the magnetic equivalent of a turbulent&#160;sea. However, since the spin waves in these systems have a well&#8208;defined length scale, and the skyrmions are on an ordered lattice, ordered structures from spin wave interference can precipitate from the chaos. This work uses small angle neutron scattering (SANS)&#160;to capture the dynamics in hybrid skyrmions and investigate the spin wave structure. Performing simultaneous ferromagnetic resonance and SANS, the diffraction pattern shows a large increase in low&#8208;angle&#160;scattering intensity which is present only in the resonance&#160;condition. This scattering pattern is best fit using a mass fractal model, which suggests the spin waves form a long&#8208;range fractal network. The fractal structure is constructed of fundamental units with a size that encodes the spin wave emissions and are constrained by the skyrmion lattice. These results offer critical insights into the nanoscale dynamics of skyrmions, identify a new dynamic spin wave fractal structure, and demonstrates SANS as a unique tool to probe high&#8208;speed dynamics.

         <title>Judicious Heteroatom Doping Produces High Performance Deep Blue/Near UV Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
We present two multi&#8208;resonant thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitters and show how further borylation of a deep blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, DIDOBNA&#8208;N, both blue shifts and narrows the emission producing a new near&#8208;UV MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N. DIDOBNA&#8208;N emits bright blue light (lPL = 444&#160;nm, FWHM = 64&#160;nm, FPL = 81%, td = 23 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The deep blue organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) based on this twisted MR&#8208;TADF compound shows a very high maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 15.3% for a device with CIEy of 0.073. The fused planar MR&#8208;TADF emitter, MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N shows efficient and narrowband near UV emission (lPL = 402&#160;nm, FWHM = 19&#160;nm, FPL = 74.7%, td = 133 ms, 1.5 wt% in TSPO1). The best OLED with MesB&#8208;DIDOBNA&#8208;N, doped in a co&#8208;host, shows the highest efficiency reported for a near UV OLED at 16.2%. With a CIEy coordinate of 0.049, this device also shows the bluest EL reported for a MR&#8208;TADF OLED to date.

         <title>Metallic Powder Promotes Nitridation Kinetics for Facile Synthesis of (oxy)nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing semiconductors (including metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, and nitrogen&#8208;doped metal oxides) have been widely researched for their application in energy conversion and environmental purification because of their unique characteristics; however, their synthesis generally encounters significant challenges owing to sluggish nitridation kinetics. Herein, we have developed a metallic powder&#8208;assisted nitridation method that effectively promotes the kinetics of nitrogen insertion into oxide precursors and exhibits good generality. By employing metallic powders with low work functions as electronic modulators, a series of oxynitrides (i.e., LnTaON2 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), Zr2ON2, and LaTiO2N) can be prepared at lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation periods to obtain comparable or even lower defect concentrations compared to those of the conventional thermal nitridation method, leading to superior photocatalytic performance. Moreover, some novel nitrogen&#8208;doped oxides (i.e., SrTiO3&#8208;xNy and Y2Zr2O7&#8208;xNy) with visible&#8208;light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed herein is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride&#8208;based materials for energy/environment&#8208;related heterogeneous catalysis.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Specific Peroxynitrite Overproduction Disrupts Metabolic Homeostasis for Sensitizing Melanoma Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor cells elicit metabolic reprogramming to establish an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) for escaping from immunosurveillance. Therefore, interrupting the metabolic adaption of tumor cells might be a promising strategy for TME immunomodulation, favoring immunotherapy. Herein, w e construct a tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; nanogenerator (APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO) that can selectively disrupt metabolic homeostasis in melanoma cells. Stimulated by melanoma&#8208;characteristic acid, glutathione, and tyrosinase, APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO could efficiently generate ONOO&#8722; through the in situ coupling of the produced O2&#8226;&#8722; and released NO. Metabolomics profiling reveals that the accumulated ONOO&#8722; induces great decrease of metabolites involved in the TCA cycle. Meanwhile, the aerobic glycolysis&#8208;produced lactate drops sharply both intracellularly and extracellularly under ONOO&#8722; stress. Mechanistically, ONOO&#8722; impairs the activity of glyceraldehyde&#8208;3&#8208;phosphate dehydrogenase in glucose metabolism through S&#8208;nitrosylation. The metabolic alterations effectively reverse the immunosuppressive TME to evoke potent antitumor immune responses, including polarization of M2&#8208;like macrophages to M1 phenotype, reduction of myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells and regulatory T cells, and restoration of CD8+ T cell infiltration. Combining APAP&#8208;P&#8208;NO pretreatment with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 achieves a significant inhibition against both primary and metastatic melanomas without systemic toxicities. Collectively, w e develop a tumor&#8208;specific ONOO&#8722; overproduction approach and explore the possible mechanism of ONOO&#8722;&#8208;mediated TME immunomodulation, providing a new strategy for facilitating immunotherapy sensitivity.

Abstract
Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability have been major impediments. Herein, we report a Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4&#8208;hcC). The FeN4&#8208;hcC catalyst displayed exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4. When integrated into a membrane electrode assembly, the corresponding cathode displayed a high maximum peak power density of 0.592&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and demonstrated operating durability over 30000 voltage cycles under harsh H2/air conditions, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8208;N&#8208;C electrocatalysts. Our experimental and theoretical studies suggested that the curved carbon support fine&#8208;tuned the local coordination environment, lowered the energies of the Fe d&#8208;band centers, and inhibited the adsorption of oxygenated species, which could enhance the ORR activity and stability. This work provides new insight into the carbon nanostructure&#8208;activity correlation for ORR catalysis. It also offers a new approach to designing advanced single&#8208;metal site catalysts for energy conversion applications.

&lt;p&gt;Fe-N-C materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum-group-metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability have been major impediments. Herein, we report a Fe-N-C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4-hcC). The FeN4-hcC catalyst displayed exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half-wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;M H2SO4.

         <title>Improving the Performance of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Organic Solar Cells via Introducing a Wide&#8208;Bandgap Dopant into the Upper Acceptor Layer</title>

Abstract
The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer (LbL) solution&#8208;processed active layer of organic solar cells (OSCs) is conductive to achieve vertical phase separation, tunable donor/acceptor (D/A) interfaces and favorable charge&#8208;transport pathways. This technique also enables facile film morphology adjustment to enhance device performance by introducing a volatile additive or a third component to the D/A system. In this work, we add a wide&#8208;bandgap component poly(9&#8208;vinylcarbazole) (PVK) into the upper electron acceptor layer to improve the performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs. Results show that the PVK component can adjust the film morphology, dope the electron acceptor, increase the electron concentration and improve charge transport. Such an n&#8208;type doping is verified by Seebeck coefficient measurement, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy and electron paramagnetic resonance characterization. In addition, the fluorescence intensity and exciton lifetime of the PVK&#8208;doped acceptor film are increased, thus being beneficial for exciton diffusion to the D/A interface. As a result, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of LbL OSCs increases from 16.02% to 17.00% when 2.50 wt% PVK is employed in the electron acceptor layer for the PM6/BTP&#8208;eC9&#8208;4F active layer and from 18.70% to 19.05% for the D18/L8&#8208;BO system when 0.50 wt% PVK is introduced. The role of PVK played in the active layer is different from those of additives and ternary components reported previously, so our results provide an alternative way to enhance the device performance of LbL&#8208;processed OSCs.

         <title>Direct Probing of Lattice&#8208;Strain&#8208;Induced Oxygen Release in LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3 without Electrochemical Cycling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Since the recognition of a significant oxygen&#8208;redox contribution to enhancing the capacity of Li transition&#8208;metal oxide cathodes, the oxygen release and subsequent structural variations together with capacity fading have been critical issues to achieve better electrochemical performance. As most previous reports dealt with the structural degradation of cathodes after electrochemical cycling, it has been fairly difficult to clarify how substantial the effect of lattice strain on the oxygen release would be while exclusively ruling out any electrochemical influences. By utilizing nanoindentation and mechanical surface polishing of single&#8208;crystal LiCoO2 and Li2MnO3, we scrutinize the local variations of both the atomic structure and oxygen content. Atomic&#8208;column&#8208;resolved imaging reveals that local Li&#8722;M (M = Co and Mn) disordering and further amorphization are induced by mechanical strain. Moreover, substantial oxygen deficiency in the regions with these structure changes is directly identified by spectroscopic analyses. Ab initio density functional theory calculations also demonstrate energetically favorable formation of oxygen vacancies under shear strain. Providing direct evidence of oxygen release as a consequence of lattice strain, the findings in this work suggest that efficient strain relaxation will be of great significance for longevity of the anion framework in layered oxide cathodes.

         <title>Fabrication of 3D Oriented MOF Micropatterns with Anisotropic Fluorescent Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep X&#8208;ray lithography is used for the fabrication of 3D&#8208;oriented metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) micropatterns. MOF films with X&#8208;ray sensitivity are obtained by using a mixed&#8208;linker strategy; the orientation of MOF crystals is achieved via heteroepitaxial growth. Fluorescent guest molecules are immobilized and aligned within spatially controlled and oriented MOF crystals. Such MOF micropatterns show anisotropic optical responses suitable for photonic applications.








Abstract
Micropatterning crystalline materials with oriented pores is necessary for the fabrication of devices with anisotropic properties. Crystalline and porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are ideal materials as their chemical and structural mutability enables precise tuning of functional properties for applications ranging from microelectronics to photonics. Herein, a patternable oriented MOF film is designed: by using a photomask under X&#8208;ray exposure, the MOF film decomposes in the irradiated areas, remaining intact in the unexposed regions. The MOF film acts simultaneously as a resist and as functional porous material. While the heteroepitaxial growth from aligned Cu(OH)2 nanobelts is used to deposit oriented MOF films, the sensitivity to radiation is achieved by integrating a brominated dicarboxylate ligand (Br2BDC) into a copper&#8208;based MOF Cu2L2DABCO (DABCO = 1,4&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane; L = BDC/Br2BDC). The lithographed samples act as diffraction gratings upon irradiation with a laser, thus confirming the quality of the extended MOF micropattern. Furthermore, the oriented MOF patterns are functionalized with fluorescent dyes. As a result, by rotating the polarization angle of the laser excitation, the alignment of the dye in the MOF is demonstrated. By controlling the functional response to light, this MOF patterning protocol can be used for the microfabrication of optical components for photonic devices.

         <title>A Unified Therapeutic&#8211;Prophylactic Tissue&#8208;Engineering Scaffold Demonstrated to Prevent Tumor Recurrence and Overcoming Infection toward Bone Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength hydrogel doped with the photothermal material MoS2 and a magnetic resonance imaging contrast agent, gadolinium&#8208;complex, is reported. The ingenious design confers a tunable degradation rate of the hydrogel as well as satisfactory weakening of bacterial infection, inhibition of tumor activity, and inducing of in situ bone tissue regeneration in vivo.








Abstract
Osteosarcoma occurs in children and adolescents frequently and leads to a high fatality rate. Although surgical resection is the most common methods in clinic, patients always suffer from tumor metastasis and recurrence and it is difficult for them to self&#8208;repair large bone defects. Furthermore, the postoperative infection from bacteria triggers an inflammatory response and hinders the bone&#8208;repair process. This work demonstrates a gadolinium (Gd)&#8208;complex and molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) co&#8208;doped N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA)/gelatin methacrylate (Gel&#8208;MA) multifunctional hydrogel (GMNG). The combination between NAGA and Gel&#8208;MA endows the GMNG with attractive mechanical properties and controllable degradation ability. The MoS2 improves the hydrogel system, which has excellent photothermal ability to kill tumor cells and inhibit bacterial infection both in vitro and in vivo. Based on the Gd&#8208;complex, the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) effect can be used to monitor the position and degradation situation of the hydrogel. Notably, accompanied by the degradation of GMNG hydrogel, the gradually released Gd3+ from the hydrogel exhibits osteogenic property and could promote new bone formation efficiently in vivo. Therefore, this strategy supplies a method to prepare multifunctional bone&#8208;defect&#8208;repair materials and is expected to represent a significant guidance and reference to the development of biomaterials for bone tissue engineering.

Abstract
Effective photon management is critical to realize high power conversion efficiencies for thin crystalline Si (c&#8208;Si) solar cells. Standard few&#8208;100&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick bulk cells achieve light trapping with macroscopic surface textures covered by thin, continuous antireflection coatings. Such sizeable textures are challenging to implement on ultrathin cells. Here, we illustrate how nanoscale Mie&#8208;resonator&#8208;arrays with a bi&#8208;modal size distribution support multiple resonances that can work in concert to achieve simultaneous antireflection and light&#8208;trapping across the broad solar spectrum. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of these light&#8208;trapping antireflection coatings (LARCs) on a 2.8&#8208;&#181;m&#8208;thick c&#8208;Si solar cell. The measured short&#8208;circuit current and corresponding power conversion efficiency are notably improved, achieving efficiencies as high as 11.2%. Measurements of the saturation current density on completed cells indicate that thermal oxides can effectively limit surface recombination. The presented design principles are applicable to a wide range of solar cells.

         <title>BiFeO3 Nanoparticles: The &#8220;Holy&#8208;Grail&#8221; of Piezo&#8208;Photo&#8208;Catalysts?</title>

Abstract
Recently, piezoelectric&#8208;based catalysis has been demonstrated to be an efficient means and promising alternative to sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalysis, where mechanical vibrations trigger redox reactions. Here, we show that 60&#160;nm average size BiFeO3 nanoparticles are very effective for piezo&#8208;degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) model dye with record degradation rate values reaching 13810 L mol&#8722;1 min&#8722;1, and even 41750 L mol&#8722;1 min&#8722;1 (i.e., 100% RhB degradation within 5&#160;min) when piezocatalysis is synergistically combined with sunlight photocatalysis. We also demonstrate that these BiFeO3 piezocatalytic nanoparticles are versatile towards several cationic and anionic dyes, and pharmaceutical pollutants, with over 80% piezo&#8208;decomposition within 120&#160;min among the six pollutants tested. The maintained high piezoelectric coefficient combined with low dielectric constant, high elastic modulus and the nanosized shape make these BiFeO3 nanoparticles extremely efficient piezocatalysts. To avoid subsequent secondary pollution and enable their reusability, the BiFeO3 nanoparticles are further embedded in a polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) matrix. The as&#8208;designed free standing, flexible, chemically stable and recyclable nanocomposites still keep remarkable piezocatalytic and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic performances (i.e., 92% and 100% RhB degradation, respectively, within 20&#160;min). This work opens a new research avenue for BiFeO3 that is the model multiferroic material, and offers a new platform for water cleaning, as well as other applications such as water splitting, CO2 reduction or surface purification.

         <title>Towards High&#8208;Performance Metal&#8208;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes: Tunable Structures and Electrochemical Properties</title>

Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been reported as promising materials for various electrochemical applications owing to their tunable porous structures and ion&#8208;sieving capability. However, it remains challenging to rationally design high&#8208;performance MOF&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries. Herein, by combining advanced characterization and modeling tools, we designed a series of nanocrystalline MOFs and systematically studied the effects of pore apertures and open metal sites on ion&#8208;transport properties and electrochemical stability of MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes. We demonstrate that MOFs with non&#8208;redox&#8208;active metal centers can lead to much wider electrochemical stability window than those with redox&#8208;active centers. Furthermore, our results suggest that pore aperture of MOFs is a dominating factor that determines the uptake of lithium salt and thus ionic conductivity. The ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations further demonstrate that open metal sites of MOFs can facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt and immobilize anions via Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction, leading to good lithium&#8208;ion mobility and high transference number. Such host&#8211;guest interaction was further quantitatively studied by cluster&#8208;model DFT calculations at the atomic level, which was confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption near edge structure analysis. Besides, the vehicle&#8208;type ion conduction mechanism in MOFs were revealed by AIMD simulations and solid&#8208;state NMR results. Benefiting from good electrochemical stability and thin/dense structure, the MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrates excellent battery performance with commercial LiFePO4 cathodes (&gt;500 cycles at 0.5 C) and LiCoO2 cathodes (up to 4.6&#160;V) at 30&#176;C. This work provides new insights into structure&#8208;property relationships between tunable structure and electrochemical properties of MOFs that can lead to the development of advanced quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

         <title>Giant Spin&#8208;Valve Effect in Planar Spin Devices Using an Artificially Implemented Nanolength Mott&#8208;Insulator Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Developing technology to realize oxide&#8208;based nanoscale planar integrated circuits is in high demand for next&#8208;generation multifunctional electronics. Oxide circuits can have a variety of unique functions, including ferromagnetism, ferroelectricity, multiferroicity, superconductivity, and mechanical flexibility. In particular, for spin&#8208;transistor applications, the wide tunability of the physical properties due to the presence of multiple oxide phases is valuable for precise conductivity matching between the channel and ferromagnetic electrodes. This feature is essential for realistic spin&#8208;transistor operations. Here, a substantially large magnetoresistance (MR) ratio of up to &#8764;140% is demonstrated for planar&#8208;type (La,Sr)MnO3 (LSMO)&#8208;based spin&#8208;valve devices. This MR ratio is 10&#8211;100 times larger than the best values obtained for semiconductor&#8208;based planar devices, which have been studied over the past three decades. This structure is prepared by implementing an artificial nanolength Mott&#8208;insulator barrier region using the phase transition of metallic LSMO. The barrier height of the Mott&#8208;insulator region is only 55 meV, which enables the large MR ratio. Furthermore, a successful current modulation, which is a fundamental functionality for spin transistors, is shown. These results open up a new avenue for realizing oxide planar circuits with unique functionalities that conventional semiconductors cannot achieve.

         <title>Low&#8208;Valent Manganese Atoms Stabilized on Ceria for Nitrous Oxide Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese atoms stabilized on ceria is the first highly active, selective, and stable material for ammonia oxidation to nitrous oxide. Atomic dispersion is achieved by simple impregnation and preserved over 70&#160;h on stream. Low&#8208;valent manganese species, complemented by the oxygen transfer ability of ceria, facilitate the supply of active oxygen species for the reaction, leading to the outstanding catalytic performance.








Abstract
Nitrous oxide, N2O, exhibits unique reactivity in oxidation catalysis, but the high manufacturing costs limit its prospective uses. Direct oxidation of ammonia, NH3, to N2O can ameliorate this issue but its implementation is thwarted by suboptimal catalyst selectivity and stability, and the lack of established structure&#8211;performance relationships. Systematic and controlled material nanostructuring offers an innovative approach for advancement in catalyst design. Herein low&#8208;valent manganese atoms stabilized on ceria, CeO2, are discovered as the first stable catalyst for NH3 oxidation to N2O, exhibiting two&#8208;fold higher productivity than the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Detailed mechanistic, computational and kinetic studies reveal CeO2 as the mediator of oxygen supply, while undercoordinated manganese species activate O2 and facilitate N2O evolution via N&#63743;N bond formation between nitroxyl, HNO, intermediates. Synthesis via simple impregnation of a small metal quantity (1&#160;wt%) predominantly generates isolated manganese sites, while full atomic dispersion is achieved upon redispersion of sporadic oxide nanoparticles during reaction, as confirmed by advanced microscopic analysis and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy. Subsequently, manganese speciation is maintained, and no deactivation is observed over 70&#160;h on stream. CeO2&#8208;supported isolated transition metals emerge as a novel class of materials for N2O production, encouraging future studies to evaluate their potential in selective catalytic oxidations at large.

         <title>Programmably Controllable Delivery of Metastable Ferrous Ions for Multiscale Dynamic Imaging Guided Photothermal Primed Chemodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed chemodynamic therapy. The complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of the tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and chemodynamic therapy is revealed.








Abstract
Metallomodulation cell death strategies are extensively investigated for antitumor therapy, such as cuproptosis, ferroptosis, and chemodynamic therapy (CDT). Undoubtedly, the accurate and specific elevation of metal ions levels in cancer cells is key to boosting their&#160;therapeutic index. Herein, a programmably controllable delivery system based on croconium dye (Croc)&#8211;ferrous ion (Fe2+) nanoprobes (CFNPs) is developed for multiscale dynamic imaging guided photothermal primed CDT. The Croc, with kinds of electron&#8208;rich iron&#8208;chelating groups, can form the Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex with a precise stoichiometry of 1:1 to steadily maintain the valence state of Fe2+. The CFNPs can achieve pH&#8208;responsive visualization and accurate Fe2+ release in cancerous tissues under the coactivation of &#8220;dual&#8208;key&#8221; stimulation of &#8220;acidity and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8221;. The acidic tumor microenvironment actuates NIR fluorescence/photoacoustic imaging and photothermal properties of CFNPs. Sequentially, under exogenous NIR light, the CFNPs enable in vivo accurate visualization of Croc&#8211;Fe2+ complex delivery for photothermal primed Fe2+ release, thus achieving CDT of tumors. By leveraging multiscale dynamic imaging technologies, the complicated spatiotemporal release of Fe2+ is sketched in a programmably controllable manner, and the domino effect of tumor pH level, photothermal effect, and CDT is also revealed, endowing customized feedback of the therapeutic panorama within the disease microenvironment.

         <title>Highly Efficient Inherent Linearly Polarized Electroluminescence from Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Single Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (LP&#8208;LED) is constructed based on 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) single crystals (SCs) with an in&#8208;plane anisotropic property. The LP&#8208;LED exhibits excellent device performance with external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 3.38% and degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74. Further, an interchip polarized optical communication system is demonstrated based on the LP&#8208;LED.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule organic single crystals (SCs) with an inherent in&#8208;plane anisotropic nature enable direct linearly polarized light emission without the need for spatially separated polarizers and complex optical structures. However, the device performance is severely restricted by the starvation of appropriate SC emitters and the difficulty in the construction of efficient SC electroluminescence (EL) devices, leading to a low external quantum efficiency (EQE) of usually smaller than 1.5%. Here, highly efficient inherent linearly polarized light&#8208;emitting diodes (LP&#8208;LEDs) are demonstrated by exploiting 2,6&#8208;diphenylanthracene (DPA) SCs as intrinsically polarized emitters. The LP&#8208;LEDs exhibit a 2.5&#8208;fold enhanced maximum EQE of 3.38%, which approaches the theoretical limit for the DPA SC&#8208;based EL device and is the highest among organic SC&#8208;based LEDs reported thus far. More importantly, a high degree of polarization (DOP) up to 0.74 is achieved for the intrinsically polarized EL emission of the DPA SC&#8208;based LP&#8208;LEDs. By leveraging the highly efficient LP&#8208;LED, an interchip polarized optical communication system consisting of organic SCs is demonstrated for the first time. This work creates a solid foundation for the exploitation of a vast new library of small&#8208;molecule organic SCs for LP&#8208;LEDs and carries broad implications for polarized optics and relevant optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Induced, Ferroelectric&#8208;Like Switching and Adjustable Dielectric Tunability in Antiferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during film deposition causes &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching (although the films retain the antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase). This is correlated with low&#8208;pressure bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes that pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase&#8208;transition boundaries. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of PbZrO3 can be adjusted.








Abstract
Antiferroelectrics, which undergo a field&#8208;induced phase transition to ferroelectric order that manifests as double&#8208;hysteresis polarization switching, exhibit great potential for dielectric, electromechanical, and electrothermal applications. Compared to their ferroelectric cousins, however, considerably fewer efforts have been made to understand and control antiferroelectrics. Here, it is demonstrated that the polarization switching behavior of an antiferroelectric can be strongly influenced and effectively regulated by point defects. In films of the canonical antiferroelectric PbZrO3, decreasing oxygen pressure during deposition (and thus increasing adatom kinetic energy) causes unexpected &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; polarization switching although the films remain in the expected antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase. This &#8220;ferroelectric&#8208;like&#8221; switching is correlated with the creation of bombardment&#8208;induced point&#8208;defect complexes which pin the antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric phase boundaries, and thus effectively delay the phase transition under changing field. The effective pinning energy is extracted via temperature&#8208;dependent switching&#8208;kinetics studies. In turn, by controlling the concentration of defect complexes, the dielectric tunability of the PbZrO3 can be adjusted, including being able to convert between &#8220;positive&#8221; and &#8220;negative&#8221; tunability near zero field. This work reveals the important role and strong capability of defects to engineer antiferroelectrics for new performance and functionalities.

         <title>Efficient Nanoscale Exciton Transport in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells Enables Reduced Bimolecular Recombination of Free Charges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pulsed&#8208;photoluminescence quantum yield is used to evaluate the domain size of bulk&#8208;heterojunction&#8208;based organic solar cells. It is found that efficient exciton dynamics are correlated with highly reduced bimolecular recombination.








Abstract
The highest&#8208;efficiency organic photovoltaic (OPV)&#8208;based solar cells, made from blends of electron&#8208;donating and electron&#8208;accepting organic semiconductors, are often characterized by strongly reduced (non&#8208;Langevin) bimolecular recombination. Although the origins of the reduced recombination are debated, mechanisms related to the charge&#8208;transfer (CT) state and free&#8208;carrier encounter dynamics controlled by the size of donor and acceptor domains are proposed as underlying factors. Here,&#160;a novel photoluminescence&#8208;based probe is reported to accurately quantify the donor&#8211;acceptor domain size in OPV blends. Specifically, the domain size is measured in high&#8208;efficiency non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (NFA) systems and a comparative conventional fullerene system. It is found that the NFA&#8208;based blends form larger domains but that the expected reductions in bimolecular recombination attributed to the enhanced domain sizes are too small to account for the observed reduction factors. Further, it is shown that the reduction of bimolecular recombination is correlated to enhanced exciton dynamics within the NFA domains. This indicates that the processes responsible for efficient exciton transport also enable strongly non&#8208;Langevin recombination in high&#8208;efficiency NFA&#8208;based solar cells with low&#8208;energy offsets.

         <title>Molecular Chameleon Carriers for Nucleic Acid Delivery: The Sweet Spot between Lipoplexes and Polyplexes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Double pH&#8208;responsive lipo amino fatty acid carriers consist of cationizable polar aminoethylene motifs and at least two cationizable apolar lipidic units, containing a central tertiary amine that disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated. The carriers form stable lipopolyplexes and mediate efficient in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid transfer, benefitting from pH&#8208;dependent structural changes for dynamic cargo delivery and release.








Abstract
Taking advantage of effective intracellular delivery mechanisms of both cationizable lipids and polymers, highly potent double pH&#8208;responsive nucleic acid carriers are generated by combining at least two lipo amino fatty acids (LAFs) as hydrophobic cationizable motifs with hydrophilic cationizable aminoethylene units into novel sequence&#8208;defined molecules.

&lt;p&gt;Double pH-responsive lipo amino fatty acid carriers consist of cationizable polar aminoethylene motifs and at least two cationizable apolar lipidic units, containing a central tertiary amine that disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated. The carriers form stable lipopolyplexes and mediate efficient in vitro and in vivo nucleic acid transfer, benefitting from pH-dependent structural changes for dynamic cargo delivery and release.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Taking advantage of effective intracellular delivery mechanisms of both cationizable lipids and polymers, highly potent double pH-responsive nucleic acid carriers are generated by combining at least two lipo amino fatty acids (LAFs) as hydrophobic cationizable motifs with hydrophilic cationizable aminoethylene units into novel sequence-defined molecules. The pH-dependent tunable polarity of the LAF is successfully implemented by inserting a central tertiary amine, which disrupts the hydrophobic character once protonated, resulting in pH-dependent structural and physical changes. This &#8220;molecular chameleon character&#8221; turns out to be advantageous for dynamic nucleic acid delivery via lipopolyplexes. By screening different topologies (blocks, bundles, T-shapes, U-shapes), LAF types, and LAF/aminoethylene ratios, highly potent pDNA, mRNA, and siRNA carriers are identified, which are up to several 100-fold more efficient than previous carrier generations and characterized by very fast transfection kinetics. mRNA lipopolyplexes maintain high transfection activity in cell culture even in the presence of &#8805;90% serum at an ultra-low mRNA dose of 3 picogram (&#8776;2 nanoparticles/cell), and thus are comparable in potency to viral nanoparticles.

         <title>Light&#8208;Writing and Projecting Multicolor Fluorescent Hydrogels for On&#8208;Demand Information Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the vertical arrangement of multilayered chromatophores in chameleon skins, a conceptually new type of flexible NIR&#8208;light&#8208;triggered rewritable multicolor hydrogel system is developed. It enables not only the transient light&#8208;writing/self&#8208;erasing/rewriting display of arbitrary information, but also the sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of multicolor patterns, which enriches the diversification of information display and improves visual information interactive experience.








Abstract
Intelligent rewritable display systems have been long expected to reduce the heavy consumption of single&#8208;use or transient devices in the age of Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things. However, it remains challenging to construct such systems with integrated functionality of remote control, rapid activation, multicolor and multimode display. Herein, by learning from the unique multilayer arrangement of chromatophores in chameleon skins, a promising kind of rewritable hydrogel multicolor systems is presented that can combine the merits of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light&#8208;writing and projecting modes for on&#8208;demand information display. Specifically, the systems have typical multilayer layout consisting of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)&#8208;sealed carbon nanotubes (CNTs) film as photothermal control unit and embedded fluorescent hydrogels as multicolor display unit, in which thermoresponsive hydrogel is constrained within non&#8208;responsive hydrogel. Such rational structure design results in the establishment of one promising display mechanism via the cascading &#8220;light trigger&#8211;heat generation&#8211;fluorescence output&#8221; process. On this basis, rapid and reversible hand&#8208;written display of arbitrary information is achieved within 5&#160;s. Also, sustainable light&#8208;projecting display of predesigned multicolor patterns is demonstrated due to the multilayer design that ensures easy patterning of photothermal control or hydrogel display layer. This study brings functional&#8208;integrated merits for novel rewritable display systems and open new possibility to construct high&#8208;end products for information display/transmission.

         <title>Bottling Liquid&#8208;Like Minerals for Advanced Materials Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and scalable method to synthesize and isolate liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors is presented. The advantage of liquid&#8208;like precursors for materials synthesis is demonstrated for calcium carbonate minerals, exploring the effects of different organic and inorganic additives on the stability of the precursor phase. The method can be employed for, for example, mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications.








Abstract
Materials synthesis via liquid&#8208;like mineral precursors has been studied since their discovery almost 25 years ago, because their properties offer several advantages, for example, the ability to infiltrate small pores, the production of non&#8208;equilibrium crystal morphologies or mimicking textures from biominerals, resulting in a vast range of possible applications. However, the potential of liquid&#8208;like precursors has never been fully tapped, and they have received limited attention in the materials chemistry community, largely due to the lack of efficient and scalable synthesis protocols. Herein, the &#8220;scalable controlled synthesis and utilization of liquid&#8208;like precursors for technological applications&#8221; (SCULPT) method is presented, allowing the isolation of the precursor phase on a gram scale, and its advantage in the synthesis of crystalline calcium carbonate materials and respective applications is demonstrated. The effects of different organic and inorganic additives, such as magnesium ions and concrete superplasticizers, on the stability of the precursor are investigated and allow optimizing the process for specific demands. The presented method is easily scalable and therefore allows synthesizing and utilizing the precursor on large scales. Thus, it can be employed for mineral formation during restoration and conservation applications but can also open up pathways toward calcium carbonate&#8208;based, CO2&#8208;neutral cements.

         <title>A Biocompatible Supercapacitor Diode with Enhanced Rectification Capability toward Ion/Electron&#8208;Coupling Logic Operations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible supercapacitor diode (CAPode) is developed by employing molybdenum oxide as the working electrode. Benefiting from the size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects of molybdenum oxide electrode, the as&#8208;built CAPode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio that is 10 times higher than those of reported systems, which enables the constructed CAPode to work well in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operation circuits.








Abstract
The main challenge faced by the forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction is that biological systems and electronic devices adopt two different information carriers, i.e., ions and electrons, respectively. To bridge the gap between these two systems, developing ion/electron&#8208;coupling devices for logic operation is a feasible and effective approach. Accordingly, herein a supercapacitor&#8208;based ionic diode (CAPode) that takes electrochemically amorphized molybdenum oxide as the working electrode is developed. Benefiting from its unique size and charge dual ion&#8208;sieving effects, the molybdenum oxide electrode exhibits a record&#8208;high rectification ratio of 136, which is over 10 times higher than those of reported systems. It also delivers an ultrahigh specific capacitance of 448 F g&#8315;1 and an excellent cycling stability of up to 20 000 cycles, greatly outperforming those of previous works. These excellent rectification capability and electrochemical performances allow the as&#8208;built CAPode to work well in AND and OR logic gates, validating great potential in ion/electron&#8208;coupling logic operations. More attractively, the superior biocompatibilities of molybdenum oxide and relevant constituent materials enable the constructed CAPode to be applied as bioelectronics without regard to biosafety, paving a new way toward forthcoming human&#8211;computer interaction.

         <title>Binary Organic Solar Cells with 19.2% Efficiency Enabled by Solid Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The addition of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene can effectively tune the phase separation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, results in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. Consequently, the binary organic solar cells exhibit 19.2% efficiency and superior photostability.








Abstract
Morphology optimization is critical for achieving high efficiency and stable bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, the use of 3,5&#8208;dichlorobromobenzene (DCBB) with high volatility and low cost to manipulate evolution of the BHJ morphology and improve the operability and photostability of OSCs is proposed. Systematic simulations reveal the charge distribution of DCBB and its non&#8208;covalent interaction with the active layer materials. The addition of DCBB can effectively tune the aggregation of PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl during film formation, resulting in a favorable phase separation and a reinforced molecular packing. As a result, a power conversion efficiency of 19.2% (certified as 19.0% by the National Institute of Metrology) for DCBB&#8208;processed PBQx&#8208;TF:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, which is the highest reported value for binary OSCs, is obtained. Importantly, the DCBB&#8208;processed devices exhibit superior photostability and have thus considerable application potential in the printing of large&#8208;area devices, demonstrating outstanding universality in various BHJ systems. The study provides a facile approach to control the BHJ morphology and enhances the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>A Biodegradable, Waterproof, and Thermally Processable Cellulosic Bioplastic Enabled by Dynamic Covalent Modification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;dynamic covalent network&#8221; reconstruction strategy is proposed for the fabrication of sustainable cellulosic bioplastics. By introducing dynamic linkages between cellulose chains, this cellulosic bioplastic is imparted with good thermo&#8208;processability, competitive mechanical properties, excellent water and solvent resistance, as well as chemical and biological degradability. This approach provides a new route for developing sustainable and degradable bioplastics from resource&#8208;abundant biomass.








Abstract
The growing environmental concern over petrochemical&#8208;based plastics continuously promotes the exploration of green and sustainable substitute materials. Compared with petrochemical products, cellulose has overwhelming superiority in terms of availability, cost, and biodegradability; however, cellulose's dense hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and highly ordered crystalline structure make it hard to be thermoformed. A strategy to realize the partial disassociation of hydrogen bonds in cellulose and the reassembly of cellulose chains via constructing a dynamic covalent network, thereby endowing cellulose with thermal processability as indicated by the observation of a moderate glass transition temperature (Tg&#160;=&#160;240&#160;&#176;C), is proposed. Moreover, the cellulosic bioplastic delivers a high tensile strength of 67&#160;MPa, as well as excellent moisture and solvent resistance, good recyclability, and biodegradability in nature. With these advantageous features, the developed cellulosic bioplastic represents a promising alternative to traditional plastics.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;dynamic covalent network&#8221; reconstruction strategy is proposed for the fabrication of sustainable cellulosic bioplastics. By introducing dynamic linkages between cellulose chains, this cellulosic bioplastic is imparted with good thermo-processability, competitive mechanical properties, excellent water and solvent resistance, as well as chemical and biological degradability. This approach provides a new route for developing sustainable and degradable bioplastics from resource-abundant biomass.

         <title>Aging Property of Halide Solid Electrolyte At The Cathode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes have recently emerged as a promising option for cathode&#8208;compatible catholytes in solid&#8208;state batteries, owing to their superior oxidation stability at high voltage and their interfacial stability. However, their day&#8208;to&#8208;month&#8208;scale aging at the cathode interface has remained unexplored until now, while its elucidation is indispensable for practical deployment. Herein, we investigate the stability of halide solid electrolytes (e.g., Li3InCl6) when used with conventional layered oxide cathodes during extended calendar aging. We find that, contrary to their well&#8208;known oxidation stability, halide solid electrolytes can be vulnerable to reductive side reactions with oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) in the long term. More importantly, the calendar aging at a low state of charge or as&#8208;fabricated state causes more significant degradation than at a high state of charge, in contrast to typical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are more susceptible to high&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;charge calendar aging. This unique characteristic of halide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries is related to the reduction propensity of metal ions in halide solid electrolytes and is correlated to the formation of an interphase due to the reductive decomposition triggered by the oxide cathode in a lithiated state. This understanding of the long&#8208;term aging properties provides new guidelines for the development of cathode&#8208;compatible halide solid electrolytes.

&lt;p&gt;Halide solid electrolytes have recently emerged as a promising option for cathode-compatible catholytes in solid-state batteries, owing to their superior oxidation stability at high voltage and their interfacial stability. However, their day-to-month-scale aging at the cathode interface has remained unexplored until now, while its elucidation is indispensable for practical deployment. Herein, we investigate the stability of halide solid electrolytes (e.g., Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;InCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) when used with conventional layered oxide cathodes during extended calendar aging. We find that, contrary to their well-known oxidation stability, halide solid electrolytes can be vulnerable to reductive side reactions with oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in the long term. More importantly, the calendar aging at a low state of charge or as-fabricated state causes more significant degradation than at a high state of charge, in contrast to typical lithium-ion batteries, which are more susceptible to high-state-of-charge calendar aging.

         <title>Active Materials for Functional Origami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In recent decades, origami has been explored to aid in the design of engineering structures. These structures span multiple scales and have been demonstrated to be used towards various areas such as aerospace, metamaterial, biomedical, robotics, and architectural applications. Conventionally, origami or deployable structures have been actuated by hands, motors, or pneumatic actuators, which can result in heavy or bulky structures. On the other hand, active materials, which reconfigure in response to external stimulus, eliminate the need for external mechanical loads and bulky actuation systems. Thus, in recent years, active materials incorporated with deployable structures have shown promise for remote actuation of light weight, programmable origami. In this review, active materials such as shape memory polymers and alloys, hydrogels, liquid crystal elastomers, magnetic soft materials, and covalent adaptable network polymers, their actuation mechanisms, as well as how they have been utilized for active origami and where these structures are applicable is discussed. Additionally, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art fabrication methods to construct active origami are highlighted. The existing structural modeling strategies for origami, the constitutive models used to describe active materials, and the largest challenges and future directions for active origami research are summarized.

         <title>Highest&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Module by Interface Engineering for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electron transport layer (ETL) places an important role in improving the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Herein, w e demonstrate a room temperature processed SnO2:OH ETL that exhibits reduced defect density, in particular lower oxygen vacancy concentration with better energy band alignment and more wettable surface for quality perovskite deposition. More importantly, an efficient electron transfer channel is produced between the ETL and the perovskite layer due to the formation of hydrogen bonds at the interface, resulting in enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite. As a result, the efficiency of a large area (36.50 cm2) flexible perovskite solar module based on MAPbI3 is increased to as high as 18.71%, to the best of o ur knowledge, this is the highest PCE value reported for flexible perovskite solar modules up to date. In addition, it exhibits high durability while maintaining over 83% of its initial PCE after flexing test cycles. Further, F&#8208;PSCs with SnO2:OH show remarkably long&#8208;term stability, owing to a high quality of the perovskite film and a strong coupling between the SnO2:OH and perovskite layer caused by hydrogen bonds,, which successfully inhibits moisture permeation.

         <title>Gradient Cationic Vacancies Enabling Inner&#8208;to&#8208;outer Tandem Homojunction: Strong local Internal Electric Field and Reformed basic sites Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Slow charge dynamics and large activation energy of CO2 severely hinder the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established strategy, while the function of common zero&#8208;dimensional vacancy defect is always restricted to promoting surface adsorption. Here, we report that gradient tungsten vacancies layer with a thickness of 3&#8764;4&#160;nm is created across the Bi2WO6 nanosheets by a post&#8208;etching approach. It enables formation of an inner&#8208;to&#8208;outer tandem homojunction with a strong internal electric field directing from outer to inner within the gradient vacancies layer, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of the photoelectron from the bulk to the surface of catalyst. Meanwhile, the introduction of gradient W vacancies changes the coordination environment around O and W atoms, leading to an alteration in the basic sites and the mode of CO2 adsorption on the catalyst surface from weak/strong adsorption (O sites) to moderate adsorption (O and W sites), which ultimately decreases the formation barrier of key intermediate *COOH and facilitates the conversion thermodynamics for CO2. Without any cocatalysts and sacrificial reagents, W&#8208;vacant Bi2WO6 shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with a CO production rate of 30.62&#160;&#956;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 and a selectivity of 99%, being one of the best catalysts in similar reaction system. This study discloses that gradient vacancies as a new type of defect will show huge potential in regulating charge dynamics and catalytic reaction thermodynamics.

         <title>Porous 2D Catalyst Covers Improve Photoelectrochemical Water&#8208;oxidation Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Confined catalysis under the cover of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials has emerged as a promising approach for achieving highly effective catalysts in various essential reactions. Here, a porous cover structure is designed to boost the interfacial charge and mass transfer kinetics of 2D&#8208;covered catalysts. The improvement in catalytic performance is confirmed by the photoelectrochemical oxidation evolution reaction (OER) on a photoanode based on an n&#8208;Si substrate modified with a NiOx thin&#8208;film model electrocatalyst covered with a porous graphene (pGr) monolayer. Experimental results demonstrate that the pGr cover enhances the OER kinetics by balancing the charge and mass transfer at the photoanode and electrolyte interface compared to the intrinsic graphene cover and cover&#8208;free control samples. Theoretical investigations further corroborate that the pore edges of the pGr cover boost the intrinsic catalytic activity of active sites on NiOx by reducing the reaction overpotential. Furthermore, the optimized pores, which can be easily controlled by plasma bombardment, allow oxygen molecules produced in the OER to pass through without peeling off the pGr cover, thus ensuring the structural stability of the catalyst. This study highlights the significant role of the porous cover structure in 2D&#8208;covered catalysts and provides new insight into the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts.

Furthermore, the optimized pores, which can be easily controlled by plasma bombardment, allow oxygen molecules produced in the OER to pass through without peeling off the pGr cover, thus ensuring the structural stability of the catalyst. This study highlights the significant role of the porous cover structure in 2D-covered catalysts and provides new insight into the design of high-performance catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rocket&#8208;inspired effervescent motors for oral macromolecule delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oral administration is a most convenient way with good patient compliance for drug delivery; while it remains challenge to achieve desirable bioavailability of most macromolecules due to the complex gastrointestinal barriers. Here, inspired by the structure and function of rocket, we present a novel micro&#8208;motor delivery system with scaled&#8208;down rocket&#8208;like architecture and effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel for efficient oral macromolecule delivery by penetrating intestinal barrier. These rocket&#8208;inspired effervescent motors (RIEMs) are composed of sharp needle tips for both loading cargoes and efficient penetrating, and tail wings for loading effervescent powders and avoiding perforation. When exposing to water environment, the effervescent&#8208;tablets&#8208;derived fuel of the RIEMs generates intensive CO2 bubbles to propel themselves to move at high speed. Thus, the RIEMs with sharp tip can inject into surrounding mucosa for effective drug releasing. Furthermore, due to their tail wings design, perforation can be effectively avoided during the injection process, ensuring the safety of RIEMs in gastrointestinal active delivery. Based on these advantages, we have demonstrated that the RIEMs can efficiently move and stab into the intestinal mucosa for insulin delivery, exhibiting efficacy in regulating blood sugar level of the diabetic rabbit model. These features indicate that our RIEMs are versatile and valuable for clinical oral macromolecules delivery.

         <title>Entering Voltage Hysteresis in Phase&#8208;Separating Materials: Revealing the Electrochemical Signature of the Intraparticle Phase&#8208;Separated State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in various materials. Usually, hysteretic behavior is an intrinsic property that cannot be circumvented in the non&#8208;equilibrium operation of the system. Herein, we show that, at least with regard to the hysteretic behavior of phase&#8208;separating battery materials, it is possible to enter (deeply) the hysteretic loop at finite battery currents. This newly observed electric response of the electrode, which is inherent to phase&#8208;separating materials, is, for the first time, related to its microscopic origin arising from a (significant) share of the active material residing in an intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state. This intriguing observation was further generalized by revealing that a phase&#8208;separating material can feature (significantly) different chemical potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current and external voltage hysteresis. Therefore, the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state significantly affected the DC and AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence for entering the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state is supported by thermodynamic reasoning and advanced modeling. The current findings will help advance the understanding, control, diagnostics, and monitoring of batteries composed of phase&#8208;separating materials while also providing pertinent motivation for the enhancement of battery design and performance.

         <title>An Ultra&#8208;stable Self&#8208;assembled Antibacterial Nanospears made of Protein</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Protein&#8208;based nanomaterials have broad applications in the biomedical and bionanotechnological sectors owing to their outstanding properties such as high biocompatibility and biodegradability, structural stability, sophisticated functional versatility, and being environmentally benign. They have gained considerable attention in drug delivery, cancer therapeutics, vaccines, immunotherapies, biosensing and biocatalysis. However, so far, in the battle against the increasing reports of antibiotic resistance and emerging drug&#8208;resistant bacteria, unique nanostructures of this kind are lacking, hindering their potential next&#8208;generation antibacterial agents. Here, we report the discovery of a class of supramolecular nanostructures with well&#8208;defined shapes, geometries, or architectures (termed &#8220;protein nanospears&#8221;) based on engineered proteins exhibiting exceptional broad&#8208;spectrum antibacterial activities. The protein nanospears were engineered via spontaneous cleavage&#8208;dependent or precisely tunable self&#8208;assembly routes using mild metal salt&#8208;ions (Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+) as a molecular trigger. The nanospears&#8217; dimensions collectively range from entire nano&#8208; to micrometre scale. The protein nanospears display exceptional thermal and chemical stability yet rapidly disassemble upon exposure to high concentrations of chatropes (&gt; 1&#160;mM SDS). Using a combination of biological assays and electron microscopy imaging, we revealed that the nanospears spontaneously induce rapid and irreparable damage to bacterial morphology via a unique action mechanism provided by their nanostructure and enzymatic action, a feat inaccessible to traditional antibiotics. These protein&#8208;based nanospears show promise as a potent tool to combat the growing threats of resistant bacteria, inspiring a new way to engineer other antibacterial protein nanomaterials with diverse structural and dimensional architectures and functional properties.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Fused Bithiophene Imide Dimer&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>

Abstract
Doped n&#8208;type polymers usually exhibit low electrical conductivities and thermoelectric power factors (PFs), restricting the development of high&#8208;performance p&#8208;n junction&#8208;based organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein we report the design and synthesis of a new cyano&#8208;functionalized fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2), CNI2, which synergistically combines the advantages of both cyano and imide functionalities, thus leading to substantially higher electron deficiency than the parent f&#8208;BTI2. On the basis of this novel building block, a series of n&#8208;type donor&#8208;acceptor and acceptor&#8208;acceptor polymers were successfully synthesized, all of which show good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. Among them, the acceptor&#8208;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivers an excellent electrcial conductivity up to 150.2 S cm&#8722;1 and a highest PF of 110.3 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in n&#8208;type OTEs, attributed to the optimized polymer electronic properties and film morphology with improved molecular packing and higher crystallinity assisted by solution&#8208;shearing technology. The PF value is the record of n&#8208;type polymers for OTEs to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to designing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and fabricating high&#8208;quality films for OTE applications.

         <title>Energy Storage Mechanism in Supercapacitors with Porous Graphdiynes: Effects of Pore Topology and Electrode Metallicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Porous graphdiynes are a new class of porous two&#8208;dimensional materials with tunable electronic structures and various pore structures. They have potential applications as well&#8208;defined nanostructured electrodes and could provide ideal platforms for understanding energy storage mechanisms underlying supercapacitors. Herein, we investigate the effect of stacking structure and metallicity on energy storage with such electrodes. Simulations revealed that supercapacitors based on porous graphdiynes of AB stacking structure could achieve both higher double&#8208;layer capacitance and ionic conductivity than AA stacking. This phenomenon is ascribed to more intense image forces in AB stacking, leading to a breakdown of ionic ordering and the formation of effective &#8220;free ions&#8221;. Macroscale analysis shows that doped porous graphdiynes could deliver both outstanding gravimetric and volumetric energy and power densities due to their enhanced quantum capacitance. These findings pave the way for designing high&#8208;performance supercapacitors by regulating pore topology and metallicity of electrode materials.

Herein, we investigate the effect of stacking structure and metallicity on energy storage with such electrodes. Simulations revealed that supercapacitors based on porous graphdiynes of AB stacking structure could achieve both higher double-layer capacitance and ionic conductivity than AA stacking. This phenomenon is ascribed to more intense image forces in AB stacking, leading to a breakdown of ionic ordering and the formation of effective &#8220;free ions&#8221;. Macroscale analysis shows that doped porous graphdiynes could deliver both outstanding gravimetric and volumetric energy and power densities due to their enhanced quantum capacitance. These findings pave the way for designing high-performance supercapacitors by regulating pore topology and metallicity of electrode materials.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Engineering Amorphous&#8208;crystallized Interface of ZrNx Barriers for Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
It is challenging to achieve long&#8208;term stability of perovskite solar cells due to the corrosion and diffusion of metal electrodes. Integration of compact barriers into devices has been recognized as an effective strategy to protect the perovskite absorber and electrode. However, the difficulty is to construct a thin layer of a few nanometers that can delay ion migration and impede chemical reactions simultaneously, in which delicate microstructure design of a stable material plays an important role. Herein, ZrNx barrier films with high amorphization were introduced in perovskite solar cells. To quantify the amorphous&#8208;crystalline (a&#8208;c) density, we employed pattern recognition techniques for the first time. We found the decreasing (a&#8208;c) interface in an amorphous film lead to dense atom arrangement and uniform distribution of chemical potential, which retards the interdiffusion at the interface between ions and metal atoms and protect the electrodes from corrosion. The resultant solar cells exhibited an improved operational stability, which retained 88% of initial efficiency after continuous maximum power point tracking under 1&#8208;Sun illumination at room temperature (25 &#730;C) for 1500 hours.

         <title>Hollow Hierarchical Cu2O&#8208;Derived Electrocatalysts Steering CO2 Reduction to Multi&#8208;Carbon Chemicals at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide into multi&#8208;carbon products using renewably generated electricity provides a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Various oxide&#8208;derived copper (OD&#8208;Cu) catalysts have been showcased, but still require high overpotential to drive C2+ production owing to sluggish carbon&#8211;carbon bond formation and low CO intermediate (*CO) coverage. Here, we circumvent the dilemma by elaborately devising OD&#8208;Cu morphology. Firstly, computational studies propose a hollow and hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu microstructure that can generate core&#8208;shell microenvironment to inhibit CO evolution and accelerate *CO dimerization via intermediate confinement and electric field enhancement, thereby boosting C2+ generation. Experimentally, we synthesize the designed nanoarchitectures through a hetero&#8208;seed inducing approach followed by electrochemical activation. In situ spectroscopic studies further elaborate correlation between *CO dimerization and designed architectures. Remarkably, the hierarchical OD&#8208;Cu manifests morphology&#8208;dependent selectivity of CO2 reduction, giving a C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 75.6% at a considerably positive potential of &#8722;0.55&#160;V versus a reversible hydrogen electrode.

         <title>Degeneracy Removal of Spin Bands in Collinear Antiferromagnets with Non&#8208;Interconvertible Spin&#8208;Structure Motif Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Energy bands in antiferromagnets are supposed to be spin degenerate in the absence of spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC). Recent studies [Physical Review B 102, 01&#8239;4422 (2020)] identified formal symmetry conditions for antiferromagnetic crystals in which this degeneracy can be lifted &#8211; spin splitting &#8211; even in the vanishing SOC (i.e., non&#8208;relativistic) limit. Materials having such symmetries could enable spin&#8208;split antiferromagnetic spintronics without the burden of using heavy atom compounds. However, the symmetry conditions that involve spin and magnetic symmetry are not always effective as practical material selection filters. Furthermore, these symmetry conditions do not readily disclose trends in the magnitude and momentum dependence of the spin splitting energy. Here, we show that the formal symmetry conditions enabling spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets can be interpreted in terms of local motif pairs, such as octahedra or tetrahedra, each carrying opposite magnetic moments. Collinear antiferromagnets with such spin&#8208;structure motif pair whose components interconvert by neither translation nor spatial inversion will show spin splitting. Such a real&#8208;space motif&#8208;based approach enables an easy way to identify and design materials (illustrated in real example materials) having spin splitting without the need for spin&#8208;orbit coupling and offers insights into the momentum dependence and magnitude of the spin splitting.

         <title>Skeletal Network Enabling New&#8208;Generation Thermoplastic Vulcanizates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A brand&#8208;new design concept of a skeletal network is pioneered to realize the upcycling of conventional vulcanizates. The resultant materials, integrated with the superior strength/elasticity of conventional vulcanizates and the extrudable reprocessability of thermoplastics, can exploit a feasible alternative toward a new generation of thermoplastic vulcanizates.








Abstract
Upcycling of cross&#8208;linked rubbers is pressing. The introduction of dynamic covalent bonds into the networks is a popular tactic for recycling thermosetting polymers, but it is very challenging to integrate engineering performance and continuous yet stable reprocessability. Based on traditional rubber formulations, herein, a straightforward strategy is presented for constructing a skeletal network (SN) through interfacial crosslinking and percolation of rubbery granules in a rubber matrix. Rapid exchange reactions involving dynamic interfacial sulfides realize repeated &#8220;fragmentation and healing&#8221; in the solid&#8208;state and consequent reconfiguration of the SN topology of the elastomer, thus endowing the resultant SN elastomer with continuous yet stable re&#8208;extrudability. These SN elastomers with hierarchical structures exhibit high gel contents, high resilience, low creep, and reinforcibility competitive to traditional vulcanizates. Specifically, SN elastomers exhibit better overall performance than commercial thermoplastic vulcanizates (TPVs) materials. Overall, a new concept of thermoplastic vulcanizates is proposed, which will promote the sustainable development of rubbers.

         <title>PF6&#8722; Pseudohalides Anion Based Metal&#8208;Free Perovskite Single Crystal for Stable X&#8208;Ray Detector to Attain Record Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work novelly introduces strong electronegative PF6&#8722; pseudohalides and synthesizes the metal&#8208;free MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 perovskites to solve the problems of oxidation, corrosion, and uncontrolled ion migration in common I&#8208;based MFPs. Importantly, the advanced SC&#8208;based X&#8208;ray detector achieves the highest sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8208;2, an ultra&#8208;low LoD of 16.3 nGyair s&#8722;1, and superior environmental and operational stability for practical applications.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;free perovskites (MFPs) possess excellent photophysical properties of perovskites while avoiding the introduction of toxic metal ions and organic solvents, and have been expanded to X&#8208;ray detection. However, iodine&#8208;based high&#8208;performance MFPs are tended to oxidation, corrosion, and uncontrolled ion migration, resulting in poor material stability and device performance. Herein, the strongly electronegative PF6&#8722; pseudohalide is used to fabricate the large&#8208;size MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 (MDBACO = methyl&#8208;N&#8242;&#8208;diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octonium) single crystals (SCs) for solving the problems of iodine ions. After the introduction of PF6&#8722; pseudohalides, the Coulomb interaction and hydrogen bonding strength are enhanced to alleviate the ion&#8208;migration and stability problems. Moreover, combined with theoretical calculations, PF6&#8722; pseudohalides increase the ion&#8208;migration barrier, and affect the contribution of its components to the energy band for a broadening bandgap. Meanwhile, the improved physical properties, such as large activation energy of ionic migration, high resistivity, and low current drift, further expand its application in low&#8208;dose and sensitive X&#8208;ray detection. Finally, the X&#8208;ray detector based on MDABCO&#8208;NH4(PF6)3 SCs achieves a sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 (highest among metal&#8208;free SCs&#8208;based detectors) and the lowest detectable dose rate (16.3 nGyair s&#8722;1). This work has expanded the selection of MFPs for X&#8208;ray detectors and somewhat advanced the development of high&#8208;performance devices.

Finally, the X-ray detector based on MDABCO-NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;(PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; SCs achieves a sensitivity of 2078 &#181;C Gy&lt;sub&gt;air&lt;/sub&gt;

This work has expanded the selection of MFPs for X-ray detectors and somewhat advanced the development of high-performance devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Observation of Quadrupolar Strain Fields forming a Shear Band in Metallic Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 4D&#8208;STEM&#8208;based analysis to directly correlate local strain field and atomic nearest&#8208;neighbor packing at the nanometer scale along shear bands in metallic glasses is developed. The observation unveils residual strain fields with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.








Abstract
For decades, scanning/transmission electron microscopy (S/TEM) techniques have been employed to analyze shear bands in metallic glasses and understand their formation in order to improve the mechanical properties of metallic glasses. However, due to a lack of direct information in reciprocal space, conventional S/TEM cannot characterize the local strain and atomic structure of amorphous materials, which are key to describe the deformation of glasses. For this work, 4&#8208;dimensional&#8208;STEM (4D&#8208;STEM) is applied to map and directly correlate the local strain and the atomic structure at the nanometer scale in deformed metallic glasses. Residual strain fields are observed with quadrupolar symmetry concentrated at dilated Eshelby inclusions. The strain fields percolate in a vortex&#8208;like manner building up the shear band. This provides a new understanding of the formation of shear bands in metallic glass.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Flux X&#8208;ray Detection by a Solution&#8208;Grown Perovskite CsPbBr3 Single&#8208;Crystal Semiconductor Detector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;cost solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 with low defect density and good short&#8208;range order shows a record&#8208;high X&#8208;ray sensitivity of &gt;10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. Under ultrahigh flux of synchrotron X&#8208;rays (106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 at 58.61&#160;keV), a good photocurrent linearity and reproducibility are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed perovskites are promising for hard X&#8208;ray and gamma&#8208;ray detection, but there are limited reports on their performance under extremely intense X&#8208;rays. Here, a solution&#8208;grown all&#8208;inorganic perovskite CsPbBr3 single&#8208;crystal semiconductor detector capable of operating at ultrahigh X&#8208;ray flux of 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2 is reported. High&#8208;quality solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystals are fabricated into detectors with a Schottky diode structure of eutectic gallium indium/CsPbBr3/Au. A high reverse&#8208;bias voltage of 1000&#160;V (435&#160;V mm&#8722;1) can be applied with a small and stable dark current of &#8776;60&#8211;70 nA (&#8776;9&#8211;10 nA mm&#8722;2), which enables a high sensitivity larger than 10 000 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a simultaneous low detection limit of 22 nGyair s&#8722;1. The CsPbBr3 semiconductor detector shows an excellent photocurrent linearity and reproducibility under 58.61&#160;keV synchrotron X&#8208;rays with flux from 106 to 1010 photons s&#8722;1 mm&#8722;2. Defect characterization by thermally stimulated current spectroscopy shows a similar low defect density of a synchrotron X&#8208;ray and a lab X&#8208;ray irradiated device. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy suggests that the excellent performance of the solution&#8208;grown CsPbBr3 single crystal may be associated with its good short&#8208;range order, comparable to the spectrometer&#8208;grade melt&#8208;grown CsPbBr3.

         <title>Versatile Microfluidics Separation of Colloids by Combining External Flow with Light&#8208;Induced Chemical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile method for separating colloids distinguished only by slight differences in their surface morphology (e.g., roughness, porosity, or polymer), is reported. It relies on combining the drift by the pressure&#8208;driven shear flow of a photosensitive surfactant solution with a surface&#8208;properties&#8208;dependent positioning of the particles within the shear flow via local active flows induced under suitable illumination.








Abstract
Separation of particles by size, morphology, or material identity is of paramount importance in fields such as filtration or bioanalytics. Up to now separation of particles distinguished solely by surface properties or bulk/surface morphology remains a very challenging process. Here a combination of pressure&#8208;driven microfluidic flow and local self&#8208;phoresis/osmosis are proposed via the light&#8208;induced chemical activity of a photoactive azobenzene&#8208;surfactant solution. This process induces a vertical displacement of the sedimented particles, which depends on their size and surface properties .&#160;Consequently, different colloidal components&#160;experience different regions of the ambient microfluidic shear flow. Accordingly, a simple, versatile method for the&#160;separation of such can be achieved by elution times in a sense of particle chromatography. The concepts are illustrated via experimental studies, complemented by theoretical analysis, which include the separation of bulk&#8208;porous from bulk&#8208;compact colloidal particles and the separation of particles distinguished solely by slight differences in their surface physico&#8208;chemical properties.

         <title>Atomic Insights into the Cu Species Supported on Zeolite for Direct Oxidation of Methane to Methanol via Low&#8208;Damage HAADF&#8208;STEM</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;damage HAADF&#8208;STEM imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of Cu species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structure of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane.








Abstract
Precise determination of the structure&#8208;property relationship of zeolite&#8208;based metal catalysts is critical for the development toward practical applications. However, the scarcity of real&#8208;space imaging of zeolite&#8208;based low&#8208;atomic&#8208;number (LAN) metal materials due to the electron&#8208;beam sensitivity of zeolites has led to continuous debates regarding the exact LAN metal configurations. Here, a low&#8208;damage high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) imaging technique is employed for direct visualization and determination of LAN metal (Cu) species in ZSM&#8208;5 zeolite frameworks. The structures of the Cu species are revealed based on the microscopy evidence and also proved by the complementary spectroscopy results. The correlation between the characteristic Cu size in Cu/ZSM&#8208;5 catalysts and their direct oxidation of methane to methanol reaction properties is unveiled. As a result, the mono&#8208;Cu species stably anchored by Al pairs inside the zeolite channels are identified as the key structure for higher C1 oxygenates yield and methanol selectivity for direct oxidation of methane. Meanwhile, the local topological flexibility of the rigid zeolite frameworks induced by the Cu agglomeration in the channels is also revealed. This work exemplifies the combination of microscopy imaging and spectroscopy characterization serves as a complete arsenal for revealing structure&#8208;property relationships of the supported metal&#8208;zeolite catalysts.

         <title>Realization of 1.54&#8208;&#181;m Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Er3+/Yb3+Co&#8208;Doped CsPbCl3 Films</title>

         <dc:description>
Er3+ 1.54&#8208;&#181;m electroluminescence based on the CsPbCl3 perovskite films for photonic devices operating in the third telecommunication window is realized through energy transfer from Yb3+activated by CsPbCl3 via a quantum cutting process to Er3+. The obtained peak external quantum efficiency far exceeds that of the Er3+&#8208;based organic light emitting diode by two orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Erbium ions (Er3+, 1.54&#160;&#181;m) electric pumped light sources with excellent optical properties and a simple fabrication process are urgently desired to satisfy the development of silicon&#8208;based integration photonics. The previous Er&#8208;based electroluminescence devices are mainly based on Er&#8208;complexes or Er&#8208;doped oxide compounds, which usually suffer from low external quantum efficiency(EQE)or high applied voltage etc. In this work, a novel type of Er3+/Yb3+ co&#8208;doped lead&#8208;halide perovskite films (Er3+/Yb3+:CsPbCl3) with the maximum photoluminescence quantum yield of 30.12% are prepared by a simple two&#8208;step solution&#8208;coating method and the corresponding light emitting diodes (Er&#8208;PeLEDs) are fabricated, which demonstrate an almost pure 1.54&#8208;&#181;m emission and a peak EQE up to 0.366% at a low applied voltage of 1.4 V. Strong negative thermal quenching effect may help Er&#8208;PeLEDs suppress Joule heating quenching. These excellent LED properties benefit mainly from the outstanding regulatory performance of acetate to perovskite films, the excellent semiconductor behavior and strong ionic property of the perovskite, and the involvement of Yb3+ ions, which can directly and efficiently transfer the exciton energy to Er3+ through a quantum cutting process. Overall, the realization of 1.54&#8208;&#181;m Er&#8208;PeLEDs offers new opportunities for silicon&#8208;based integrated light sources.

         <title>In Situ Grown Silver&#8211;Polymer Framework with Coordination Complexes for Functional Artificial Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF) is proposed, in which silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are in situ grown (for sensing) with simultaneous formation of metal&#8211;ligand coordination complexes (for actuating). The seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification at nano&#8208;/molecular levels in a single homogenous material platform simultaneously imparts multimodal sensation and excellent load&#8208;lifting into soft robots, thus fully mimicking sensory motions (proprio&#8208;/exteroception) of biological organisms.








Abstract
Self&#8208;sensing actuators are critical to artificial robots with biomimetic proprio&#8208;/exteroception properties of biological neuromuscular systems. Existing add&#8208;on approaches, which physically blend heterogeneous sensor/actuator components, fall short of yielding satisfactory solutions, considering their suboptimal interfaces, poor adhesion, and electronic/mechanical property mismatches. Here, a single homogeneous material platform is reported by creating a silver&#8211;polymer framework (SPF), thus realizing the seamless sensing&#8211;actuation unification. The SPF&#8208;enabled elastomer is highly stretchable (1200%), conductive (0.076&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), and strong (0.76&#160;MPa in&#8208;strength), where the stretchable polymer matrix synthesis and in situ silver nanoparticles reduction are accomplished simultaneously. Benefiting from the multimodal sensing capability from its architecture itself (mechanical and thermal cues), self&#8208;sensing actuation (proprio&#8208;deformations and external stimuli perceptions) is achieved for the SPF&#8208;based pneumatic actuator, alongside an excellent load&#8208;lifting attribute (up to 3700 times its own weight), substantiating its advantage of the unified sensing&#8211;actuation feature in a single homogenous material. In view of its human somatosensitive muscular systems imitative functionality, the reported SPF bodes well for use with next&#8208;generation functional tissues, including artificial skins, human&#8211;machine interfaces, self&#8208;sensing robots, and otherwise dynamic materials.

         <title>Foldable Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Merging Electronic States between Defective and Perfect Perovskite Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Merging orbitals between the defect and perfect crystals within perovskites are found in chemosynthetic foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) that convert discrete island trap states to continuous electronic states, and the mini module achieves high efficiency and fill factor.








Abstract
Defective and perfect sites naturally exist within electronic semiconductors, and considerable efforts to reduce defects to improve the performance of electronic devices, especially in hybrid organic&#8211;inorganic perovskites (ABX3), are undertaken. Herein, foldable hole&#8208;transporting materials (HTMs) are developed, and they extend the wavefunctions of A&#8208;site cations of perovskite, which, as hybridized electronic states, link the trap states (defective site) and valence band edge (perfect site) between the naturally defective and perfect sites of the perovskite surface, finally converting the discrete trap states of the perovskite as the continuous valence band to reduce trap recombination. Tailoring the foldability of the HTMs tunes the wavefunctions between defective and perfect surface sites, allowing the power conversion efficiency of a small cell to reach 23.22% and that of a mini&#8208;module (6.5 &#215; 7&#160;cm, active area&#160;=&#160;30.24&#160;cm2) to reach as high as 21.71% with a fill factor of 81%, the highest value reported for non&#8208;spiro&#8208;OMeTAD&#8208;based perovskite solar modules.

         <title>Bifunctional Gas Diffusion Electrode Enables In Situ Separation and Conversion of CO2 to Ethylene from Dilute Stream</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bifunctional gas diffusion electrode is reported for integrated CO2 separation and electrochemical conversion to ethylene from low concentration CO2 stream (10&#160;vol%), bypassing the prerequisite of energy&#8208;intensive incumbent CO2 capture and regeneration, compression, and transportation steps.








Abstract
The requirement of concentrated carbon dioxide (CO2) feedstock significantly limits the economic feasibility of electrochemical CO2 reduction (eCO2R) which often involves multiple intermediate processes, including CO2 capture, energy&#8208;intensive regeneration, compression, and transportation. Herein, a bifunctional gas diffusion electrode (BGDE) for separation and eCO2R from a low&#8208;concentration CO2 stream is reported. The BGDE is demonstrated for the selective production of ethylene (C2H4) by combining high&#8208;density&#8208;polyethylene&#8208;derived porous carbon (HPC) as a physisorbent with polycrystalline copper as a conversion catalyst. The BGDE shows substantial tolerance to 10 vol% CO2 exhibiting a Faradaic efficiency of &#8776;45% toward C2H4 at a current density of 80 mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming previous reports that utilized such partial pressure (PCO2 = 0.1 atm and above) and unaltered polycrystalline copper. Molecular dynamics simulation and mixed gas permeability assessment reveal that such selective performance is ensured by high CO2 uptake of the microporous HPC as well as continuous desorption owing to the molecular diffusion and concentration gradient created by the binary flow of CO2 and nitrogen (CO2|N2) within the sorbent boundary. Based on detailed techno&#8208;economic analysis, it is concluded that this in situ process can be economically compelling by precluding the C2H4 production cost associated with the energy&#8208;intensive intermediate steps of the conventional decoupled process.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By turning the dimension and aspect ratios of BaTiO3 (BTO) nanofillers,&#160;an anisotropic distribution of surface potential is observed on the BTO nanofibers/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) (BTNF) nanocomposite membrane after polarization. After covering supercritical&#8208;sized calvarial defects in rats, the BTNF composite membrane facilitates improved bone regeneration that leads to almost complete healing after 12 weeks post&#8208;implantation, which is mediated by the heterogeneous electrical&#160;microenvironment. 








Abstract
The heterogeneity of extracellular matrix (ECM) topology, stiffness, and architecture is a key factor modulating cellular behavior and osteogenesis. However, the effects of heterogeneous ECM electric potential at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis remain to be elucidated. Here, the heterogeneous distribution of surface potential&#160;is established by incorporating ferroelectric BaTiO3 nanofibers (BTNF) into poly(vinylidene fluoridetrifluoroethylene) (P(VDF&#8208;TrFE)) matrix based on phase&#8208;field and first&#8208;principles simulation. By optimizing the aspect ratios of BTNF fillers, the anisotropic distribution of surface potential on BTNF/P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) nanocomposite membranes can be achieved by strong spontaneous electric polarization of BTNF fillers.&#160;These&#160;results indicate that heterogeneous surface potential distribution leads to a meshwork pattern of fibronectin (FN) aggregation, which increased FN&#8208;III7&#8208;10 (FN fragment) focal flexibility and anchor points as predicted by molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, integrin clustering, focal adhesion formation, cell spreading, and adhesion&#160;are enhanced sequentially. Increased traction of actin fibers amplifies mechanotransduction by promoting nuclear translocation of YAP/Runx2, which enhances osteogenesis in vitro and bone regeneration in vivo. The work thus provides fundamental insights into the biological effects of surface potential heterogeneity at the micro&#8208; and nanoscale on osteogenesis, and also develops a new strategy to optimize the performance of electroactive biomaterials for tissue regenerative therapies.

         <title>Multifunctional Conjugated Molecular Additives for Highly Efficient Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multifunctional conjugated additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A) are introduced into the perovskite&#8208;emitting layer of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs). &#960;&#8208;Conjugated semiconducting additives effectively passivate defects, release residual tensile stress, and decrease the variation in the contact potential difference in perovskites with negligible sacrifice in charge transport, demonstrating highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs with a maximum EQE of 21.3%.








Abstract
Further optimization of perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is impeded by crystal deformation caused by residual stress and defect formation with subsequent non&#8208;radiative recombination. Molecular additives for defect passivation are widely studied; however, the majority have insulating properties that hinder charge injection and transport. Herein, highly efficient green&#8208;emitting PeLEDs are reported by introducing semiconducting molecular additives (Fl&#8208;OEGA and Fl&#8208;C8A). Transmission electron microscopy shows that conjugated additives exist primarily at the grain boundaries of perovskite, and Kelvin probe force microscopy confirms that the variation in contact potential difference between grain boundaries and perovskite crystal domains is significantly reduced. The residual tensile stress is reduced by 13% and the activation energy for ion migration increases in the Fl&#8208;OEGA&#8208;treated perovskite film, compared to those of the film without additives. Compared to insulating 2,2&#8242;&#8208;(ethylenedioxy)diethylamine (EDEA), the introduction of semiconducting additives prevents a significant reduction in the charge&#8208;transport capability. Furthermore, the PeLEDs with Fl&#8208;OEGA show a negligible shift in the turn&#8208;on voltage and a significantly smaller decrease in the current density with increasing Fl&#8208;OEGA compared to the devices with EDEA. Finally, the 3D CsPbBr3&#8211;PeLEDs show the highest external quantum efficiency of 21.3% by the incorporation of semiconducting Fl&#8208;OEGA as a new multifunctional additive.

         <title>Nontrivial Topological Surface States in Ru3Sn7 toward Wide pH&#8208;Range Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A topological material, Ru3Sn7, is prepared, in which topological surface states are accommodated in the {001} crystal family. The Ru3Sn7 is suitable for HER in both acid and alkali, with superior overpotentials of 28 and 27 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2, and ultrasmall Tafel slopes of 22 and 40 mV dec&#8722;1, respectively.








Abstract
Nontrivial topological surface states (TSSs), which possess extraordinary carrier mobility and are protected by the bulk symmetry, have emerged as an innovative platform to search for efficient electrocatalysts toward hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a Sn&#8208;based nontrivial metal Ru3Sn7 is prepared using electrical arc melting method. The results indicate that the (001) crystal family of Ru3Sn7 possesses nontrivial TSSs with linear dispersion relation and large nontrivial energy window. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that nontrivial TSSs of Ru3Sn7 can significantly boost charge transfer kinetics and optimize adsorption of hydrogen intermediates due to bulk symmetry&#8208;protected band structures. As expected, nontrivial Ru3Sn7 exhibits superior HER activity to Ru, Pt/C, and trivial counterparts (e.g., Ru2Sn3, IrSn2, and Rh3Sn2) with higher ratios of noble metals. Furthermore, the wide pH&#8208;range activity of topologically nontrivial Ru3Sn7 implies the robustness of its TSSs against pH variation during the HER. These findings provide a promising approach to the rational design of topologically nontrivial metals as highly efficient electrocatalysts.

         <title>Regulation of Quantum Wells Width Distribution in Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum well distribution of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites is effectively narrowed by regulation formation enthalpy of reaction with hydroiodic acid additive due to the construction of new reaction path. The carrier transport properties of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite with the narrow quantum wells are remarkably enhanced, and the resultant photodetector shows much higher performance and humidity stability.








Abstract
Dynamic optimization of the quantum&#8208;well (QW) width distribution in quasi&#8208;2D halide perovskite thin films is an effective approach for tuning the properties of photoelectric devices. Here, that the QWs width distribution in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite films can be controlled only by using hydroiodic acid (HI) as an additive is demonstrated. A uniform distribution of the colloidal particle size in the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite precursor solution is achieved through the formation of soluble iodoplumbate coordination complexes, PbI3&#8722; from the reaction of HI with PbI2, resulting in an improved phase purity in the final film. Density functional theory calculations indicate that the ideal n value quasi&#8208;2D perovskite reaction pathway through the PbI3&#8722; complex has a lower enthalpy of formation than the random nucleation pathway without the HI additive. Benefiting from this merit, a high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;2D perovskite film with optimized phase purity delivered a balanced carrier diffusion length and improved carrier mobility. The resultant photodetectors exhibited a light on/off ratio of 50&#160;000, a responsivity of 0.96 A W&#8722;1, and a detectivity of 5.7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 532&#160;nm. In addition, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device maintained more than 80% of its initial photocurrent after 720&#160;h of storage at 30% relative humidity.

         <title>A Novel Potassium Salt Regulated Solvation Chemistry Enabling Excellent Li&#8208;Anode Protection in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is synthesized, which can dramatically improve the compatibility between lithium (Li) anode and carbonate electrolytes by forming a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;m) in the electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) exhibit superior cycling stability.








Abstract
In lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs), the compatibility of Li anode and conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate&#8208;(LiPF6) carbonate electrolyte is poor owing to the severe parasitic reactions. Herein, to resolve this issue, a delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is unprecedentedly synthesized. On the one hand, KFPB additive can regulate the solvation structure of the carbonate electrolyte, promoting the formation of Li+&#63743;FPB&#8722; and K+&#63743;PF6&#8722; ion pairs with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. On the other hand, FPB&#8722; anion possesses strong adsorption ability on Li anode. Thus, anions can preferentially adsorb and decompose on the Li&#8208;anode surface to form a conductive and robust solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;m) in the carbonate electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and Li||Cu and Li||Li half cells exhibit excellent Li&#8208;plating/stripping stability upon cycling. Encouragingly, KFPB&#8208;assisted carbonate electrolyte enables high areal capacity LiCoO2||Li, LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811)||Li, and LiNi0.8Co0.05Al0.15O2 (NCA)||Li LMBs with superior cycling stability, showing its excellent universality.

     alt="A Novel Potassium Salt Regulated Solvation Chemistry Enabling Excellent Li-Anode Protection in Carbonate Electrolytes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is synthesized, which can dramatically improve the compatibility between lithium (Li) anode and carbonate electrolytes by forming a robust solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) in the electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and lithium-metal batteries (LMBs) exhibit superior cycling stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In lithium-metal batteries (LMBs), the compatibility of Li anode and conventional lithium hexafluorophosphate-(LiPF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) carbonate electrolyte is poor owing to the severe parasitic reactions. Herein, to resolve this issue, a delicately designed additive of potassium perfluoropinacolatoborate (KFPB) is unprecedentedly synthesized. On the one hand, KFPB additive can regulate the solvation structure of the carbonate electrolyte, promoting the formation of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;FPB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;PF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; ion pairs with lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels. On the other hand, FPB&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; anion possesses strong adsorption ability on Li anode. Thus, anions can preferentially adsorb and decompose on the Li-anode surface to form a conductive and robust solid-electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer. Only with a trace amount of KFPB additive (0.03&#160;&lt;span class="smallCaps"&gt;m&lt;/span&gt;) in the carbonate electrolyte, Li dendrites&#8217; growth can be totally suppressed, and Li||Cu and Li||Li half cells exhibit excellent Li-plating/stripping stability upon cycling. Encouragingly, KFPB-assisted carbonate electrolyte enables high areal capacity LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li, LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCM811)||Li, and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.15&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCA)||Li LMBs with superior cycling stability, showing its excellent universality. This work reveals the importance of designing novel additives to regulate the solvation structure of carbonate electrolytes in improving its interface compatibility with the Li anode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mechanistic Insight into the Synergy between Platinum Single Atom and Cluster Dual Active Sites Boosting Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The decoration of atomically dispersed Pt cocatalysts, including single atom (SA) and/or atomic cluster (C), on CdS semiconductors is achieved by ALD. The optimized PtSA+C/CdS photocatalysts with dual active sites and suitable spatial distance present the best photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity due to the conspicuous synergy between Pt SA and cluster.








Abstract
In the energy transition context, the design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance Pt&#8208;based photocatalysts with low Pt content and ultrahigh atom&#8208;utilization efficiency for hydrogen production are essential. Herein, a facile approach for decorating atomically dispersed Pt cocatalysts having single&#8208;atom (SA) and atomic cluster (C) dual active sites on CdS nanorods (PtSA+C/CdS) via atomic layer deposition is reported. The size of the cocatalyst and the spatial intimacy of the cocatalyst active sites are precisely engineered at the atomic scale. The PtSA+C/CdS photocatalysts show the optimized photocatalytic hydrogen evolution activity, achieving a reaction rate of 80.4&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is 1.6&#8208; and 7.3&#8208;fold higher than those of the PtSA/CdS and PtNP/CdS photocatalysts, respectively. Thorough characterization and theoretical calculations reveal that the enhanced photocatalytic activity is due to a remarkable synergy between SAs and atomic clusters as dual active sites, which are responsible for water adsorption&#8211;dissociation and hydrogen desorption, respectively. A similar synergetic effect is found in a representative Pt/TiO2 system, indicating the generality of the strategy. This study demonstrates the significance of the synergy between active sites for enhancing the reaction efficiency, opening a new avenue for the rational design of atomically dispersed photocatalysts with high efficiency.

         <title>Rational Design of PDI&#8208;Based Linear Conjugated Polymers for Highly Effective and Long&#8208;Term Photocatalytic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Three PDI&#8208;based linear conjugated polymers are synthesized for highly effective and long&#8208;term photocatalytic oxygen evolution through rational design. Bicarbonyl embedded Oxamide&#8208;PDI exhibits 5110.25&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 under full spectrum irradiation without any co&#8208;catalyst exceeding most reported organic polymer photocatalysts, characterization, and DFT calculation reveals the ordered stacking, robust build&#8208;in electric field, and low exciton binding energy contribute greatly.








Abstract
Constructed through relatively weak noncovalent forces, the stability of organic supramolecular materials has shown to be a challenge. Herein, the designing of a linear conjugated polymer is proposed through creating a chain polymer connected via bridging covalent bonds in one direction and retaining &#960;&#8208;stacked aromatic columns in its orthogonal direction. Specifically, three analogs of linear conjugated polymers through tuning the aromatic core and its covalently linked moiety (bridging group) within the building block monomer are prepared. Cooperatively supported by strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions from the extended aromatic core of perylene and favorable dipole&#8211;dipole interactions from the bridging group, the as&#8208;expected high crystallinity, wide light absorption, and increased stability are successfully achieved for Oxamide&#8208;PDI (perylene diimide)&#160;through ordered molecular arrangement, and present a remarkable full&#8208;spectrum oxygen evolution rate of 5110.25&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 without any cocatalyst. Notably, experimental and theoretical studies reveal that large internal dipole moments within Oxamide&#8208;PDI together with its ordered crystalline structure enable a robust built&#8208;in electric field for efficient charge carrier migration and separation. Moreover, density functional theory (DFT) calculations also reveal oxidative sites located at carbon atoms next to imide bonds and inner bay positions based on proven spatially separated photogenerated electrons and holes, thus resulting in highly efficient water photolysis into oxygen.

         <title>Noninvasive Photodelamination of van der Waals Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing photodelamination phenomenon that arises from ordered band alignment and resultant energy&#8208;funneling effect is observed in nonuniform van der Waals semiconductors, which holds potential as a noninvasive but convenient atomic&#8208;layer etching strategy for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.








Abstract
Atomically thin 2D van der Waals semiconductors are promising candidate materials for post&#8208;silicon electronics. However, it remains challenging to attain completely uniform monolayer semiconductor wafers free of over&#8208;grown islands. Here, the observation of the energy&#8208;funneling effect and ambient photodelamination phenomenon in inhomogeneous few&#8208;layer WS2 flakes under low&#8208;illumination fluencies down to several nW &#181;m&#8722;2 and its potential as a noninvasive atomic&#8208;layer etching strategy for selectively stripping the local excessive overlying islands are reported. Photoluminescent tracking on the photoetching traces reveals relatively fast etching rates of around 0.3&#8211;0.8&#160;&#181;m min&#8722;1 at varied temperatures and an activation energy of 1.7&#160;eV. By using crystallographic and electronic characterization, the noninvasive nature of the low&#8208;power photodelamination and the highly preserved lattice quality are also confirmed in the as&#8208;etched monolayer products, featuring a comparable density of atomic defects (&#8776;4.2 &#215; 1013 cm&#8722;2) to pristine flakes and a high electron mobility of up to 80 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature. This approach opens a noninvasive postetching route for thickness uniformity management in 2D van der Waals semiconductor wafers for electronic applications.

         <title>Sono&#8208;Driven Sting Activation Using Semiconducting Polymeric Nanoagonists For Precision Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy of Head And Neck Squamous Cell Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Immunotherapy has offered new opportunities to treat head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC); however, its clinical applications are hindered by modest therapeutic outcomes and the &#8220;always&#8208;on&#8221; pharmacological activity of immunomodulatory agents. Strategies for precise spatiotemporal activation of antitumor immunity can tackle these issues but remain challenging. Herein, we report a semiconducting polymeric nanoagonist (SPNM) with in situ sono&#8208;activatable immunotherapeutic effects for precision sono&#8208;immunotherapy of HNSCC. SPNM is self&#8208;assembled from a sonodynamic semiconducting polymer core conjugated with a stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist (MSA&#8208;2) via a singlet oxygen cleavable linker. Under sono&#8208;irradiation, SPNM produces singlet oxygen not only to eradicate tumor cells to trigger immunogenic cell death but also to unleash caged STING agonists via the cleavage of diphenoxyethene bonds for in&#8208;situ activation of the STING pathway in the tumor region. Such sono&#8208;driven STING activation mediated by SPNM promotes effector T cell infiltration and potentiates systemic antitumor immunity, eventually leading to tumor growth inhibition and long&#8208;term immunological memory. This study thus presents a promising strategy for the precise spatiotemporal activation of cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles Derived from Dermal Fibroblasts Attenuate Inflammation in a Murine Model of Acute Lung Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) represents a significant burden to the health care system, with approximately 200,000 cases diagnosed annually in the US. ARDS patients suffer from severe refractory hypoxemia, alveolar&#8208;capillary barrier dysfunction, impaired surfactant function, and abnormal upregulation of inflammatory pathways that lead to intensive care unit admission, prolonged hospitalization, and increased disability&#8208;adjusted life years. Currently, there is no cure or FDA&#8208;approved therapy for ARDS. This work describes the implementation of engineered extracellular vesicle (eEV)&#8208;based nanocarriers for targeted non&#8208;viral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory payloads to the inflamed/injured lung. Our results show the ability of surfactant protein A (SPA) functionalized IL&#8208;4&#8208; and IL&#8208;10&#8208;loaded eEVs to promote intrapulmonary retention and reduce inflammation, both in vitro and in vivo. We observed significant attenuation in tissue damage, proinflammatory cytokine secretion, macrophage activation, influx of protein&#8208;rich fluid and neutrophil infiltration into the alveolar space as early as 6 hours post&#8208;eEVs treatment. Additionally, metabolomics analyses showed that eEV treatment caused significant changes in the metabolic profile of inflamed lungs, driving secretion of key anti&#8208;inflammatory metabolites. Altogether, these results establish the potential of eEVs derived from dermal fibroblasts to reduce inflammation, tissue damage, and the prevalence/progression of injury during ARDS via non&#8208;viral delivery of anti&#8208;inflammatory genes/transcripts.

         <title>Structure Design of Soft Magnetic Materials using Electron Beam&#8208;based Additive Manufacturing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt.%) soft magnetic materials in toroidal shape are additively manufactured by means of Electron Beam Powder Bed Fusion (PBF&#8208;EB). Different hatching strategies are applied to realize specific patterns of molten material alternating with non&#8208;molten powder particles. The specimens produced using different hatching strategies show identical relative densities but various structural features resulting in different magnetic properties. The magnetic performance of the specimens is characterized by determining hysteresis loops (B&#8208;H curves), power losses and maximum magnetic flux density at frequencies between 50&#160;Hz and 1000&#160;Hz. At constant mass, the different structures induced by using various hatching strategies have a strong influence on the hysteresis losses. These losses can be significantly reduced by applying a targeted structure design. The modified specimens show superior magnetic properties at sub&#8208;kHz compared to some soft magnetic materials fabricated by means of conventional methods and Laser Powder Bed Fusion (PBF&#8208;L).

         <title>Molecular Tuning of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Fibrous Hydrogel Enables Control over Viscoelasticity and Creates Tunable ECM&#8208;Mimetic Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining both the mechanical dynamics and the fibrous nanostructure of the native extracellular matrix in a synthetic material remains a challenge. In this study, the molecular tuning of benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide supramolecular structures to create fibrous hydrogels with control over the stress&#8208;relaxation timescale is studied. This enables their use as cell culture matrices and bioinks for 3D bioprinting.








Abstract
Traditional synthetic covalent hydrogels lack the native tissue dynamics and hierarchical fibrous structure found in the extracellular matrix (ECM). These dynamics and fibrous nanostructures are imperative in obtaining the correct cell/material interactions. Consequently, the challenge to engineer functional dynamics in a fibrous hydrogel and recapitulate native ECM properties remains a bottle&#8208;neck to biomimetic hydrogel environments. Here,&#160;the molecular tuning of a supramolecular benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator via simple modulation of hydrophobic substituents is reported. This tuning results in fibrous hydrogels with accessible viscoelasticity over 5 orders of magnitude, while maintaining a constant equilibrium storage modulus. BTA hydrogelators are created with systematic variations in the number of&#160;hydrophobic carbon atoms, and this is observed to control the viscoelasticity and stress&#8208;relaxation timescales in a logarithmic fashion. Some of these&#160;BTA hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, self&#8208;healing, extrudable, and injectable, and can be 3D printed into multiple layers. These hydrogels show high cell viability for chondrocytes and human mesenchymal stem cells, establishing their use in tissue engineering applications. This simple molecular tuning by changing hydrophobicity (with just a few carbon atoms) provides precise control over the viscoelasticity and 3D printability in fibrillar hydrogels and can be ported onto other 1D self&#8208;assembling structures. The molecular control and design of hydrogel network dynamics can push the field of supramolecular chemistry toward&#160;the design of new ECM&#8208;mimicking hydrogelators for numerous cell&#8208;culture and tissue&#8208;engineering applications and give access toward&#160;highly biomimetic bioinks for bioprinting.

         <title>Arming Ru with Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Enriched RuO2 Sub&#8208;Nanometer Skin Activates Superior Bifunctionality for pH&#8208;Universal Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS core&#8211;shell heterostructure is explored by thermally controlled oxidation of the Ru/C hybrid microsheet to arm the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 sub&#8208;nanometer skin on Ru core, &#8211; displaying ultrasmall overpotentials of 176/201&#160;mV for the oxygen evolution reaction and 46/6&#160;mV toward the hydrogen evolution reaction&#160;at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively.








Abstract
Water electrolysis has been expected to assimilate the renewable yet intermediate energy&#8208;derived electricity for green H2 production. However, current benchmark anodic catalysts of Ir/Ru&#8208;based compounds suffer severely from poor dissolution resistance. Herein, an effective modification strategy is proposed by arming a sub&#8208;nanometer RuO2 skin with abundant oxygen vacancies to the interconnected Ru clusters/carbon hybrid microsheet (denoted as Ru@V&#8208;RuO2/C HMS), which can not only inherit the high hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of the Ru, but more importantly, activate the superior activity toward the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in both acid and alkaline conditions. Outstandingly, it can achieve an ultralow overpotential of 176/201&#160;mV for OER and 46/6&#160;mV for the HER to reach 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic and alkaline solution, respectively. Inspiringly, the overall water splitting can be driven with an ultrasmall cell voltage of 1.467/1.437&#160;V for 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4/1.0&#160;m KOH, respectively. Density functional theory calculations reveal that armoring the oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;enriched RuO2 exoskeleton can cooperatively alter the interfacial electronic structure and make the adsorption behavior of hydrogen and oxygen intermediates much close to the ideal level, thus simultaneously speeding up the hydrogen evolution kinetics and decreasing the energy barrier of oxygen release.

         <title>Ultrafast Laser Plasmonic Fabrication of Nanocrystals by Molecule Modulation for Photoresponse Multifunctional Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to assemble Au nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks based on glue molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication technique is proposed. It demonstrates that ultrafast laser&#8208;fabricated bridged structures exhibit enhanced photothermal conversion capacity owing to the broad absorption, which can be used for photoresponse functional devices.








Abstract
Nanotechnology has attracted wide research attention in constructing functional devices, including integrated circuits, transparent electrodes, and flexible actuators. Bottom&#8208;up fabrication is an important approach for functional structure manufacture, however, the controllable fabrication of complex architectures for practical applications has long been a challenge. Here, a novel strategy of laser plasmonic fabrication based on glue molecule modulation is proposed that can assemble metal nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks. The plasmonic response of nanocrystals is adjustable with molecule modulation, which is a benefit for the effective formation of laser&#8208;induced localized oscillating electrons. The further decomposition of molecules and the movement of nanocrystal surface atoms can achieve the coalescence of assembled nanocrystals. It demonstrates that complex architectures can be controllably constructed by molecule level modulation. Through molecule&#8208;assisted laser plasmonic fabrication, the functional nanocrystals with enhanced photothermal capacity can be used for information encryption and soft machinery. This work expands the knowledge of bottom&#8208;up fabrication and provides a method for designing functional nanocrystals for a wide range of applications.

     alt="Ultrafast Laser Plasmonic Fabrication of Nanocrystals by Molecule Modulation for Photoresponse Multifunctional Structures"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A strategy to assemble Au nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks based on glue molecule-assisted laser plasmonic fabrication technique is proposed. It demonstrates that ultrafast laser-fabricated bridged structures exhibit enhanced photothermal conversion capacity owing to the broad absorption, which can be used for photoresponse functional devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology has attracted wide research attention in constructing functional devices, including integrated circuits, transparent electrodes, and flexible actuators. Bottom-up fabrication is an important approach for functional structure manufacture, however, the controllable fabrication of complex architectures for practical applications has long been a challenge. Here, a novel strategy of laser plasmonic fabrication based on glue molecule modulation is proposed that can assemble metal nanocrystals into interconnected pattern networks. The plasmonic response of nanocrystals is adjustable with molecule modulation, which is a benefit for the effective formation of laser-induced localized oscillating electrons. The further decomposition of molecules and the movement of nanocrystal surface atoms can achieve the coalescence of assembled nanocrystals. It demonstrates that complex architectures can be controllably constructed by molecule level modulation. Through molecule-assisted laser plasmonic fabrication, the functional nanocrystals with enhanced photothermal capacity can be used for information encryption and soft machinery. This work expands the knowledge of bottom-up fabrication and provides a method for designing functional nanocrystals for a wide range of applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Electrochemical Healing of Fractured Metals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Empowered by a quantitative predictive framework, room&#8208;temperature area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition with a single commonly used electrolyte enables 100% restoration of tensile strength in a variety of fractured metals, including &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys and a 3D&#8208;printed complex structure. This framework could potentially enable a universal approach to repair fractured metals of various compositions, geometries, and length scales.








Abstract
Repairing fractured metals to extend their useful lifetimes advances sustainability and mitigates carbon emissions from metal mining and processing. While high&#8208;temperature techniques are being used to repair metals, the increasing ubiquity of digital manufacturing and &#8220;unweldable&#8221; alloys, as well as the integration of metals with polymers and electronics, call for radically different repair approaches. Herein, a framework for effective room&#8208;temperature repair of fractured metals using an area&#8208;selective nickel electrodeposition process refered to as electrochemical healing is presented. Based on a model that links geometric, mechanical, and electrochemical parameters to the recovery of tensile strength, this framework enables 100% recovery of tensile strength in nickel, low&#8208;carbon steel, two &#8220;unweldable&#8221; aluminum alloys, and a 3D&#8208;printed difficult&#8208;to&#8208;weld shellular structure using a single common electrolyte. Through a distinct energy&#8208;dissipation mechanism, this framework also enables up to 136% recovery of toughness in an aluminum alloy. To facilitate practical adoption, this work reveals scaling laws for the energetic, financial, and time costs of healing, and demonstrates the restoration of a functional level of strength in a fractured standard steel wrench. Empowered with this framework, room&#8208;temperature electrochemical healing can open exciting possibilities for the effective, scalable repair of metals in diverse applications.

         <title>In Situ Device&#8208;Level TEM Characterization Based on Ultra&#8208;Flexible Multilayer MoS2 Micro&#8208;Cantilever</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical transmission electron microscopy characterization platform is first developed by integrating with an ultra&#8208;flexible piezoresistive molybdenum disulfide&#160;micro&#8208;cantilever for device&#8208;level electromechanical and opto&#8208;electromechanical mechanism exploration.








Abstract
Current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in&#160;situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization technology has been capable of statically or dynamically nanorobotic manipulating specimens, affording abundant atom&#8208;level material attributes. However, an insurmountable barrier between material attributes investigations and device&#8208;level application explorations exists due to immature in&#160;situ TEM manufacturing technology and sufficient external coupled stimulus. These limitations seriously prevent the development of in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization. Herein, a representative in&#160;situ opto&#8208;electromechanical TEM characterization platform is put forward by integrating an ultra&#8208;flexible micro&#8208;cantilever chip with optical, mechanical, and electrical coupling fields for the first time. On this platform, static and dynamic in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterizations are implemented by utilizing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2)&#160;nanoflake as channel material. E&#8208;beam modulation behavior in MoS2&#160;transistors is demonstrated at ultra&#8208;high e&#8208;beam acceleration voltage (300&#160;kV), stemming from inelastic scattering electron doping into MoS2&#160;nanoflakes. Moreover, in&#160;situ dynamic bending MoS2&#160;nanodevices without/with laser irradiation reveals asymmetric piezoresistive properties based on electromechanical effects and secondary enhanced photocurrent based on opto&#8208;electromechanical coupling effects, accompanied by real&#8208;time monitoring atom&#8208;level characterization. This approach provides a step toward advanced in&#160;situ device&#8208;level TEM characterization technology with excellent perception ability and inspires in&#160;situ TEM characterization with ultra&#8208;sensitive force feedback and light sensing.

         <title>Large Scale BN&#8208;perovskite Nanocomposite Aerogel Scintillator for Thermal Neutron Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large scale, long time stability, ultra&#8208;low density, and strong radiation hardness BN&#8208;CsPbBr3 nanocomposite aerogel scintillators are obtained with high nanocrystal loading that are highly transparent to visible photons. These nanocomposite scintillating materials provide the new thermal neutron detection mechanism, and offer the weakest X(&#611;)&#8208;ray response and totally different, time&#8208;resolved response pulses.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermal neutron scintillation detectors rely on rare isotopes for neutron capture, lack stability and scalability of solid&#8208;state scintillation devices, and poorly discriminate between the neutron and gamma rays. The boron nitride (BN)&#8208;CsPbBr3 perovskite nanocomposite aerogel scintillator enables discriminative detection of thermal neutrons, features the largest known size (9&#160;cm across), the lowest density (0.17&#160;g&#160;cm&#8722;3) among the existing scintillation materials, high BN (50%) perovskite (1%) contents, high optical transparency (85%), and excellent radiation stability. The new detection mechanism relies on thermal neutron capture by 10B and effective energy transfer from the charged particles to visible&#8208;range scintillation photons between the densely packed BN and CsPbBr3 nanocrystals. Low density minimizes the gamma ray response. The neutrons and gamma rays are discriminated by complete decoupling of the respective single pulses in time and intensity. These outcomes open new avenues for neutron detection in resource exploration, clean energy, environmental, aerospace, and homeland security applications.

         <title>Designing Covalent Organic Framework&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Driven Microswimmers toward Therapeutic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two structurally and texturally distinct covalent organic frameworks (COF)&#8208;based light&#8208;driven microswimmers with different nanopore sizes are designed and studied for potential drug delivery applications as multifunctional organic microswimmers. The real&#8208;time visualization of the drug carrier COF&#8208;based microswimmers enables new insights into the function of porous organic micromachines, which will help to solve various drug delivery problems in biological media.








Abstract
While micromachines with tailored functionalities enable therapeutic applications in biological environments, their controlled motion and targeted drug delivery in biological media require sophisticated designs for practical applications. Covalent organic frameworks (COFs), a new generation of crystalline and nanoporous polymers, offer new perspectives for light&#8208;driven microswimmers in heterogeneous biological environments including intraocular fluids, thus setting the stage for biomedical applications such as retinal drug delivery. Two different types of COFs, uniformly spherical TABP&#8208;PDA&#8208;COF sub&#8208;micrometer particles and texturally nanoporous, micrometer&#8208;sized TpAzo&#8208;COF particles are described and compared as light&#8208;driven microrobots. They can be used as highly efficient visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven drug carriers in aqueous ionic and cellular media. Their absorption ranging down to red light enables phototaxis even in deeper and viscous biological media, while the organic nature of COFs ensures their biocompatibility. Their inherently porous structures with &#8776;2.6&#160; and &#8776;3.4&#160;nm pores, and large surface areas allow for targeted and efficient drug loading even for insoluble drugs, which can be released on demand. Additionally, indocyanine green (ICG) dye loading in the pores enables photoacoustic imaging, optical coherence tomography, and hyperthermia in operando conditions. This real&#8208;time visualization of the drug&#8208;loaded COF microswimmers enables unique insights into the action of photoactive porous drug carriers for therapeutic applications.

         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;stability, and low&#8208;cost Te0.7Se0.3 infrared photodiode is fabricated throughcomplementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS)&#8208;compatible&#160;low&#8208;temperature thermal evaporation. The device achieves the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiodes, a low&#160;dark current density , the ability of matter identification, and superior electrical and thermal stabilities. This work paves a new way for CMOS&#8208;compatible infrared imagers.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared detectors&#160;are increasingly important in the fields of autonomous driving, food safety, disease diagnosis, and scientific research. However, mature short&#8208;wave infrared cameras such as InGaAs have the disadvantage of complex heterogeneous integration with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) readout circuits, leading to high cost and low imaging resolution. Herein, a low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and high&#8208;stability TexSe1&#8211;x short&#8208;wave infrared photodiode detector is reported. The TexSe1&#8211;x thin film is fabricated through CMOS&#8208;compatible low&#8208;temperature evaporation and post&#8208;annealing process, showcasing the potential of direct integration on the readout circuit. The device demonstrates a broad&#8208;spectrum response of 300&#8211;1600&#160;nm, a room&#8208;temperature specific detectivity of 1.0 &#215; 1010 Jones, a &#8722;3&#160;dB bandwidth up to 116&#160;kHz, and a linear dynamic range of over 55&#160;dB, achieving the fastest response among Te&#8208;based photodiode devices and a dark current density 7 orders of magnitude smaller than Te&#8208;based photoconductive and field&#8208;effect transistor devices. With a simple Si3N4 packaging, the detector shows high electric stability and thermal stability, meeting the requirements for vehicular applications. Based on the optimized TexSe1&#8211;x photodiode detector, the applications in material identification and masking imaging is demonstrated. This work paves a new way for CMOS&#8208;compatible infrared imaging chips.

         <title>Sodium&#8208;Based Concave Metasurfaces for High Performing Plasmonic Optical Filters by Templated Spin&#8208;on&#8208;Sodiophobic&#8208;Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a sodium&#8208;based plasmonic concave metasurface for high&#8208;performing subtractive optical filtering enabled by the template&#8208;induced solidification of liquid metals process. The proposed optical filter enables a minimum linewidth down to &#8776;15 nm, a minimum reflection residual less to &#8776;3% as well as measure&#8208;to&#8208;design spectral match ratio&#160;to &#8776;1500.








Abstract
Optical filters have aroused tremendous excitement in advanced photonic instruments and modern digital displays due to their flexible capability of spectrum manipulation. Plasmonic metasurfaces of narrow bandwidth, high spectral contrast, and robust structure tolerance are highly desired for optical filtration (especially in the visible regime) but rather challenging as large spectral broadening from intrinsic ohmic loss and design/fabrication deviations. Here the high&#8208;performing sodium&#8208;based metasurfaces are demonstrated for optical filtration across 450 to 750&#160;nm by unique structure design of spatially decoupled concave surfaces and precise fabrication through templated solidification of liquid metals. Thanks to the distinct suppression of metallic loss as well as fabrication tolerance of interfacial structures, the as&#8208;prepared concave metasurfaces enable a minimum linewidth of &#8776;15&#160;nm, a maximal optical contrast of &#8776;93%, and a high measure&#8208;to&#8208;design spectral match ratio &#8776;1500. These results have for the first time pushed the operation wavelengths of sodium&#8208;based plasmonic devices from infrared to visible which in turn demonstrates the capability of filling the blank of commercial dielectric optical filters thus far.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Area&#8208;Selective Spatial Atomic Layer Deposition of SiO2 with Interleaved Small Molecule Inhibitors and Integrated Back&#8208;Etch Correction for Low Defectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and plasma etching are combined within the same tool for achieving area&#8208;selective spatial atomic layer deposition of SiO2 at high&#8208;throughput. Two SMIs using experimental and Density Functional Theory data are compared and their blocking performance in terms of size, packing density, and chemisorption energy is discussed. Low&#8208;energy ion scattering spectroscopy demonstrates the high&#8208;selectivity of the combined approach.








Abstract
A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind area&#8208;selective deposition process for SiO2&#160;is developed consisting of film deposition with interleaved exposures to small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) and back&#8208;etch correction steps, within the same spatial atomic layer deposition (ALD) tool. The synergy of these&#160;aspects results in selective SiO2&#160;deposition up to&#160;~23&#160;nm with high selectivity and throughput, with SiO2&#160;growth area and ZnO nongrowth area. The selectivity is corroborated by both X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and low&#8208;energy ion scattering spectroscopy (LEIS). The selectivity conferred by two different SMIs, ethylbutyric acid, and pivalic acid has been compared experimentally and theoretically. Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations reveal that selective surface functionalization using both SMIs is predominantly controlled thermodynamically, while the better selectivity achieved when using trimethylacetic acid can be explained by its higher packing density&#160;compared to ethylbutyric acid. By employing the trimethylacetic acid as SMI on other starting surfaces (Ta2O5, ZrO2,&#160;etc.) and probing the selectivity, a broader use of carboxylic acid inhibitors for different substrates is demonstrated. It is believed that the current results highlight the subtleties in SMI properties such as size, geometry, and packing, as well as interleaved back&#8208;etch steps, which are key in developing ever more effective strategies for highly selective deposition processes.

         <title>Pancreatic Tumor&#8208;targeting Stemsome Therapeutics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to the intrinsic ability of stem cells to target the tumor environment, stem cell membrane&#8208;functionalized nanocarriers can target and load active anticancer drugs. In this study, a strategy that focuses on stem cells that self target pancreatic cancer cells was deveolped. In particular, malignant deep tumors such as pancreatic cancer cells, one of the intractable tumors that currently have no successful clinical strategy, are available for targeting and destruction. By gaining the targeting ability of stem cells against pancreatic tumor cells, stem cell membranes can encapsulate nano polylactide&#8208;co&#8208;glycolide (PLGA) loaded with doxorubicin to target and reduce deep pancreatic tumor tissues. Considering the lack of known target proteins on pancreatic tumor cells, the suggested platform technology could be utilized for targeting any malignant tumors in which surface target receptors are unavailable.

         <title>Albumin&#8208;Hitchhiking Drug Delivery to Tumor&#8208;draining Lymph Nodes Precisely Boosts Tumor&#8208;Specific Immunity through Autophagy Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are the first sites where tumor components reach and dendritic cells (DCs) present tumor&#8208;associated antigens to T cells. DCs rely on autophagy to process tumor antigens into epitope peptides to form epitope&#8208;MHC complexes. Selective delivery of autophagy&#8208;stimulating drugs to TDLNs may be a precise strategy to boost chemotherapy&#8208;induced anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Here, we propose a multistage stimulating strategy to activate the anti&#8208;tumor immunity cascade by inducing immunogenic death of tumor cells and elevating antigen presentation of DCs in TDLNs. A tumor microenvironment responsive &#8220;albumin&#8208;hitchhiking&#8221; micelle is established by self&#8208;assembling tumor&#8208;targeting oxaliplatin prodrug and lipophilized trehalose prodrug. We demonstrate that lipophilic modification of trehalose with a DSPE tail and the precise exposure in the tumor site enhances its binding to endogenous albumin and realizes TDLNs&#8208;selective reflux, where it upregulates antigen processing and presentation of DCs. This study introduces an approach for TDLNs targeted delivery and provides insights into mechanisms of autophagy in tumor&#8208;specific immunity.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;confined Electrochemical Synthesis of Sub&#8208;unit Cell non van der Waals 2D Metal Oxides</title>

Abstract
Bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis of atomically thin materials is desirable yet challenging, especially for non&#8208;van der Waals (vdW) materials. Thicknesses below few nm have not been reported yet, posing the question how thin can non&#8208;vdW materials be electrochemically synthesized? This is important as materials with (sub&#8208;) unit cell thickness often show remarkably different properties compared to their bulk form or thin films of several nm thickness. Here, we introduce a straightforward electrochemical method utilizing the angstrom&#8208;confinement of laminar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanochannels to obtain a centimeter&#8208;scale network of atomically thin (&lt; 4.3 &#197;) 2D&#8208;transition metal oxides (2D&#8208;TMO). The angstrom&#8208;confinement provides a thickness limitation, forcing sub&#8208;unit cell growth of 2D&#8208;TMO with oxygen and metal vacancies. We showcase that Cr2O3, a material without significant catalytic activity for OER in bulk form, can be activated as a high&#8208;performing catalyst if synthesized in the 2D sub&#8208;unit cell form. Our method displays the high activity of sub&#8208;unit cell form while retaining the stability of bulk form, promising to yield unexplored fundamental science and applications. We show that while retaining the advantages of bottom&#8208;up electrochemical synthesis like simplicity, high yield, and mild conditions, the thickness of TMO can be limited to sub&#8208;unit cell dimensions.

&lt;p&gt;Bottom-up electrochemical synthesis of atomically thin materials is desirable yet challenging, especially for non-van der Waals (vdW) materials. Thicknesses below few nm have not been reported yet, posing the question how thin can non-vdW materials be electrochemically synthesized? This is important as materials with (sub-) unit cell thickness often show remarkably different properties compared to their bulk form or thin films of several nm thickness. Here, we introduce a straightforward electrochemical method utilizing the angstrom-confinement of laminar reduced graphene oxide (rGO) nanochannels to obtain a centimeter-scale network of atomically thin (&amp;lt; 4.3 &#197;) 2D-transition metal oxides (2D-TMO). The angstrom-confinement provides a thickness limitation, forcing sub-unit cell growth of 2D-TMO with oxygen and metal vacancies. We showcase that Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a material without significant catalytic activity for OER in bulk form, can be activated as a high-performing catalyst if synthesized in the 2D sub-unit cell form.

         <title>Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Biomimetic Multi&#8208;Color Separating Photonic Skin Using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Structural colors can be produced by nano&#8208;periodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nano&#8208;structural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multi&#8208;colors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multi&#8208;color control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multi&#8208;color separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multi&#8208;color separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multi&#8208;arrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multi&#8208;color concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multi&#8208;color control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

         <title>Atomically unraveling the structural evolution of surfaces and interfaces in metal halide perovskite quantum dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Revealing the local structural change of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) induced by external conditions is important to understand their performance and stability in optoelectronic applications. However, previous studies on the properties and structures of MHPs were usually limited by the spatial resolution of the probe, and it is still challenging to obtain their atomic structural information in real space. In this work, we apply the integrated differential phase contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy to the low&#8208;dose imaging of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs). In particular, the local structures in QDs, such as surfaces and interfaces, can be atomically resolved. Then, the structural evolution of CsPbI3 QDs under various external conditions can be unraveled during in&#8208;situ heating or ex&#8208;situ treatments, where they will lose cubic shapes and fuse to larger particles. The changes in surfaces and interfaces with missing Cs ions and PbI6 octahedrons can be semi&#8208;quantitatively studied by profile analysis and bond&#8208;length measurement in images. Finally, the density functional theory calculations are performed to illustrate the properties and stabilities of the different structures that we observed. These results provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structural evolution of QDs, which is of great importance to modify the performance of perovskite materials and devices.

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials with dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surfaces and atomically thin layers have been shown to be capable of being incorporated into flexible electronic devices. The electronic and optical properties of 2D materials can be tuned or controlled in other ways by using the intriguing strain engineering method. We condensed the latest and encouraging techniques in regards to creating flexible 2D nanoelectronics in this review article. These techniques have the potential to be used in a wider range of applications in the near and long term. It is possible to use ultrathin 2D materials 2D materials (graphene, BP, WTe2, VSe2 etc.) and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs) in order to enable the electrical behavior of the devices to be studied. A category of materials was produced on smaller scales by exfoliating bulk materials, whereas chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and epitaxial growth were employed on larger scales. The overview of our review paper highlights two distinct requirements, which include from a single semiconductor or with van der Waals heterostructures of various nanomaterials. They include where strain must be avoided, such as solutions in order to produce strain&#8208;insensitive devices, and they include where strain is required, such as pressure&#8208;sensitive outcomes. Stretchable nanoelectronics' use in e&#8208;skin as well as a comparison of the features and functionality of 2D flexible electronic devices are all discussed as methods in order to impart stretchability in addition to material and structural engineering. Finally, the points&#8208;of&#8208;view about the current difficulties and possibilities in regards to using 2D materials in flexible electronics are provided.

         <title>Carbonization Temperature Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers &#8208; from Nanoscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitril (PAN) based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600&#176;C to 1000&#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM). At the microscale, the CNF networks show good electrical interconnections enabling a homogeneously distributed current flow. The network's homogeneity is underlined by the strong correlation of macroscopic conductivities, determined by the four&#8208;point&#8208;method, and microscopic results. Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large high&#8208;resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. High&#8208;resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered high&#8208;resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation&#160;paths.

Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large high-resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. High-resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered high-resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation&#160;paths.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Drycells: Cell&#8208;suspension micro liquid marbles for single&#8208;cell picking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cell&#8208;picking technology is essential for cell culturing. Although the recently developed tools enable single&#8208;cell&#8208;level with a &gt;95% aqueous culture medium, thereby acting as a powerful cell&#8208;picking tool, is reported. The proposed &#8220;drycells&#8221; are formed by spraying a cell suspension onto a powder bed of hydrophobic fumed silica nanoparticles. The particles adsorb to the droplet surface and form a superhydrophobic shell, which prevents the drycells from coalescence. The number of encapsulated cells per drycell can be controlled by adjusting the drycell size and cell&#8208;suspension concentration. Moreover, it is possible to encapsulate a pair of normal or cancerous cells and create several cell colonies within a single drycell. A sieving process can be used to sort the drycells according to size. The size of the droplet can range from one to hundreds of micrometers. The drycells are sufficiently stiff to be collected using a tweezer; however, centrifugation separates them into nanoparticles and cell&#8208;suspension layers, with the separated particles being recyclable. Various handling techniques, such as splitting coalescence and inner liquid replacement, can be used. We believe that the application of the proposed drycells will greatly improve the accessibility and productivity of single&#8208;cell analysis.

         <title>Cancer Models on Chip: Paving the Way to Large Scale Trial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. Three&#8208;dimensional tumor&#8208;on&#8208;chip models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment, the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, and major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic tumor&#8208;on&#8208;chip models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein we report a simple posttreatment for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which leads to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibited a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8764;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1,000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Weaving Aerogels into a 3D Ordered Hyperelastic Hybrid Carbon Assembly</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of a three&#8208;dimensional (3D) carbon assembly with a combination of extraordinary electrochemical and mechanical properties is desirable yet challenging. Herein, an ultralight and hyperelastic nanofiber&#8208;woven hybrid carbon assembly (NWHCA) is fabricated by nanofiber weaving of isotropic porous and mechanical brittle quasi&#8208;aerogels. Upon subsequent pyrolysis, metallogel&#8208;derived quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization and nitrogen/phosphorus co&#8208;doping were integrated into the NWHCA. Finite element simulation indicates that the 3D lamella&#8208;bridge architecture of NWHCA with the quasi&#8208;aerogel hybridization contributes to resisting plastic deformation and structural damage under high compression, experimentally demonstrated by complete deformation recovery at 80% compression and unprecedented fatigue resistance (&gt; 94% retention after 5000 cycles). Due to the superelasticity and quasi&#8208;aerogel integration, the zinc&#8208;air battery assembled based on NWHCA shows excellent electrochemical performance and flexibility. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept integrated device is presented, in which the flexible battery powers a piezoresistive sensor, using the NWHCA as the air cathode and the elastic conductor respectively, which could detect full&#8208;range and sophisticated motions while attached to human skin. The nanofiber weaving strategy allows the construction of lightweight, superelastic, and multifunctional hybrid carbon assemblies with great potential in wearable and integrated electronics.

         <title>Data Class&#8208;Specific All&#8208;Optical Transformations and Encryption</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks since the spatial information of a scene can be directly accessed by a diffractive processor without requiring any digital pre&#8208;processing steps. Here we present data class&#8208;specific transformations all&#8208;optically performed between the input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOVs) of a diffractive network. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or intensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all&#8208;optically processed by a data class&#8208;specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor&#8208;array directly measures the transformed patterns, all&#8208;optically encrypted using the transformation matrices pre&#8208;assigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. The class&#8208;specificity of these all&#8208;optical diffractive transformations creates opportunities where different keys can be distributed to different users; each user can only decode the acquired images of only one data class, serving multiple users in an all&#8208;optically encrypted manner. We numerically demonstrated all&#8208;optical class&#8208;specific transformations covering A &#8594; A, I &#8594; I, and P &#8594; I transformations using various image datasets. We also experimentally validated the feasibility of this framework by fabricating class&#8208;specific I &#8594; I transformation diffractive networks and successfully tested them at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.

Abstract
Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi&#8208;scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shift in biofabrication. This ultra&#8208;fast, light&#8208;based technique sculpts cell&#8208;laden hydrogel bioresins into three&#8208;dimensional structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell&#8208;friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, for the first time, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel&#8208;based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non&#8208;transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds into the volumetric printing process, high&#8208;resolution bioprinted structures were successfully achieved. Tensile, burst and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes were tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi&#8208;material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, engineered tubular structures were obtained by building tri&#8208;layered cell&#8208;laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that could be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi&#8208;technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi&#8208;material living structures.

         <title>Selective Methionine Pool Exhaustion Mediated by a Sequential Positioned MOF Nanotransformer for Intense Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Cancer cells are addictive to exogenous methionine to gear toward tumor proliferation. Meanwhile, they could replenish methionine pool from polyamine metabolism through methionine salvage pathway. However, the current developed therapeutic tactics for methionine depletion remain facing great challenges in terms of the selectivity, safety and efficiency. Herein, a sequential positioned metal organic framework (MOF) nanotransformer was designed to selectively exhaust methionine pool via inhibiting the uptake of methionine and throttling its salvage pathway for enhanced cancer immunotherapy. The MOF nanotransformer could restrain the open source and reduce the reflux of methionine to exhaust methionine pool of cancer cells. Moreover, the intracellular traffic routes of sequential positioned MOF nanotransformer matched well with the distribution of polyamines, which was conducive to the oxidation of polyamines via its responsive deformability and nanozyme&#8208;augmented Fenton&#8208;like reaction for the final exhaustion of intracellular methionine. Our results verified that the well&#8208;designed platform could not only kill cancer cells efficiently but also promote the infiltration of CD8 and CD4 T cells for intensive cancer immunotherapy. Overall, we believe that our work will inspire the construction of novel MOF&#8208;based antineoplastic platform and provide new insights into the development of metabolic&#8208;related immunotherapy.

         <title>Trehalose&#8208;Guanosine Glycopolymer Hydrogels Direct Adaptive Glia Responses in CNS Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neural tissue damaged after central nervous system (CNS) injury does not naturally regenerate but is instead replaced by non&#8208;neural fibrotic scar tissue that serves no neurological function. Scar&#8208;free repair to create a more permissive environment for regeneration requires altering the natural injury responses of glial cells. In this work, glycopolymer&#8208;based supramolecular hydrogels are synthesized to direct adaptive glia repair after CNS injury. Combining poly(trehalose&#8208;co&#8208;guanosine) (pTreGuo) glycopolymers with free guanosine (fGuo) generates shear thinning hydrogels through stabilized formation of long&#8208;range G&#8208;quadruplex secondary structures. Hydrogels with smooth or granular microstructures and mechanical properties spanning three orders of magnitude are produced through facile control of pTreGuo hydrogel composition. Injection of pTreGuo hydrogels into healthy mouse brain elicits minimal stromal cell infiltration and peripherally derived inflammation that is comparable to a bioinert methyl cellulose benchmarking material. pTreGuo hydrogels alter astrocyte borders and recruit microglia to infiltrate and resorb the hydrogel bulk over 7 days. Injections of pTreGuo hydrogels into ischemic stroke alter the natural responses of glial cells after injury to reduce the size of lesions and increase axon regrowth into lesion core environments. These results support the use of pTreGuo hydrogels as part of neural regeneration strategies to activate endogenous glia repair mechanisms.
