         <title>Dynamic Surface Evolution of Metal Oxides for Autonomous Adaptation to Catalytic Reaction Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dynamic self&#8208;reorganization of as&#8208;prepared materials during catalytic reactions brings about novel catalytic properties. Here, a thorough overview of how the surfaces of metal oxides are reorganized in nanoscale under diverse (electro)chemical reaction conditions is presented. Also, how the surface changes influence catalytic functionality is discussed from experimental and theoretical standpoints, presenting valuable design guidelines for future energy materials.








Abstract
Metal oxides possessing distinctive physical/chemical properties due to different crystal structures and stoichiometries play a pivotal role in numerous current technologies, especially heterogeneous catalysis for production/conversion of high&#8208;valued chemicals and energy. To date, many researchers have investigated the effect of the structure and composition of these materials on their reactivity to various chemical and electrochemical reactions. However, metal oxide surfaces evolve from their initial form under dynamic reaction conditions due to the autonomous behaviors of the constituent atoms to adapt to the surrounding environment. Such nanoscale surface phenomena complicate reaction mechanisms and material properties, interrupting the clarification of the origin of functionality variations in reaction environments. In this review, the current findings on the spontaneous surface reorganization of metal oxides during reactions are categorized into three types: 1) the appearance of nano&#8208;sized second phase from oxides, 2) the (partial) encapsulation of oxide atoms toward supported metal surfaces, and 3) the oxide surface reconstruction with selective cation leaching in aqueous solution. Then their effects on each reaction are summarized in terms of activity and stability, providing novel insight for those who design metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;based catalytic materials.

         <title>Merging the Interfaces of Different Shape&#8208;Shifting Polymers Using Hybrid Exchange Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid exchange reactions (among ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) enable stable seamless bonding of covalently cross&#8208;linked networks made by different chemistry, as well as to produce new materials by cross&#8208;fusion. Distinctive multimaterial 3D shape&#8208;shifting structures are demonstrated since this strategy facilitates flexible design in morphology and integration of diverse properties in a monolithic recyclable and potentially healable system.








Abstract
Sophisticated shape&#8208;shifting structures and integration of advanced functions often call for different&#8208;chemistry&#8208;based polymers (such as epoxy and polyurethane) in a unified system. However, permanent cross&#8208;links pose crucial obstacles to be seamless. Here, merging interfaces via hybrid exchange reactions among different dynamic covalent bonds (including ester, urethane, thiourethane, boronic&#8211;ester, and oxime&#8211;ester linkages) is proposed, breaking the long&#8208;lasting restriction that these widely used bonds only undergo self&#8208;exchange reactions. Model compound studies are conducted to verify that hybrid exchange reactions occur. As demonstrations, different liquid crystal elastomers are tenaciously joined into coherent assemblies, with the desired biomimetic structures (e.g., flying fish containing stiff and flexible parts) and rare deformation modes (e.g., flower blooming upon both heating and cooling). Besides connecting polymers, hybrid exchange reactions also facilitate the creation of new materials through cross&#8208;fusion of different polymers. In addition to the polymers used in this work, hybrid exchange reactions can be adapted to other polymers based on similar mechanisms and beyond. Besides shape&#8208;shifting&#8208;related areas (e.g., soft robots, flexible electronics, and biomedical devices), it may also foster innovation in other fields involving general polymers, as well as promote deeper understanding of dynamic covalent chemistry.

         <title>Synergistic Reinforcing of Immunogenic Cell Death and Transforming Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages Via a Multifunctional Cascade Bioreactor for Optimizing Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite is developed to achieve the two&#8208;way enhancement of Ca2+ overload and photodynamic therapy related immunogenic cell death, by disrupting the mitochondrial Ca2+ buffering capacity and allaying hypoxia. Moreover, the subsequently escaped oxidatively damaged mitochondrial DNA is able to activate M1 polarization of tumor associated macrophages. Combining CCMH with aPD&#8208;L1 significantly improves immunotherapy efficacy.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD) has aroused widespread attention because it can reconstruct a tumor microenvironment and activate antitumor immunity. This study proposes a two&#8208;way enhancement of ICD based on a CaO2@CuS&#8211;MnO2@HA (CCMH) nanocomposite to overcome the insufficient damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of conventional ICD&#8208;inducers. The near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation (1064&#160;nm) of CuS nanoparticles generates 1O2 through photodynamic therapy (PDT) to trigger ICD, and it also damages the Ca2+ buffer function of mitochondria. Additionally, CaO2 nanoparticles react with H2O to produce a large amount of O2 and Ca2+, which respectively lead to enhanced PDT and Ca2+ overload during mitochondrial damage, thereby triggering a robust ICD activation. Moreover, oxidative&#8208;damaged mitochondrial DNA, induced by PDT and released from tumor cells, reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment by transforming tumor&#8208;associated macrophages to the M1 subphenotype. This study shows that CCMH with NIR&#8208;II irradiation can elicit adequate DAMPs and an active tumor&#8208;immune microenvironment for both 4T1 and CT26 tumor models. Combining this method with an immune checkpoint blockade can realize an improved immunotherapy efficacy and long&#8208;term protection effect for body.

         <title>Porous Covalent Organic Polymer Coordinated Single Co Site Nanofibers for Efficient Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Cathodes in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid processable COP&#8208;based material is directly used in fuel cell devices via a pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The nanofibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a hierarchical porous texture and the full dispersion of the atomic Co active sites. Resultingly, both the power density and durability are significantly improved compared with the traditional conventional spraying methods.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;coordinated single&#8208;cobalt&#8208;atom electrocatalysts, particularly ones derived from high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis of cobalt&#8208;based zeolitic imidazolate frameworks (ZIFs), have emerged as a new frontier in the design of oxygen reduction cathodes in polymer electrolyte fuel cells (PEFCs) due to their enhanced durability and smaller Fenton effects related to the degradation of membranes and ionomers compared with emphasized iron&#8208;based electrocatalysts. However, pyrolysis techniques lead to obscure active&#8208;site configurations, undesirably defined porosity and morphology, and fewer exposed active sites. Herein, a highly stable cross&#8208;linked nanofiber electrode is directly prepared by electrospinning using a liquid processability cobalt&#8208;based covalent organic polymer (Co&#8208;COP) obtained via pyrolysis&#8208;free strategy. The resultant fibers can be facilely organized into a free&#8208;standing large&#8208;area film with a uniform hierarchical porous texture and a full dispersion of atomic Co active sites on the catalyst surface. Focused ion beam&#8208;field emission scanning electron microscopy and computational fluid dynamics experiments confirm that the relative diffusion coefficient is enhanced by 3.5 times, which can provide an efficient route both for reactants to enter the active sites, and drain away the produced water efficiently. Resultingly, the peak power density of the integrated Co&#8208;COP nanofiber electrode is remarkably enhanced by 1.72 times along with significantly higher durability compared with conventional spraying methods. Notably, this nanofabrication technique also maintains excellent scalability and uniformity.

         <title>Tailoring Poly(Styrene&#8208;co&#8208;maleic anhydride) Networks for All&#8208;Polymer Dielectrics Exhibiting Ultrahigh Energy Density and Charge&#8211;Discharge Efficiency at Elevated Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all&#8208;organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high&#8208;temperatures and high&#8208;fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh&#8208;environment applications.








Abstract
Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability.

&lt;p&gt;Ultrahigh discharged energy densities at elevated temperatures are achieved in all-organic crosslinked polymer dielectrics by tailoring polymer networks at the molecular level. This work provides new insights into the polymer structures that control electrical conduction at high-temperatures and high-fields, which will propel the development of scalable capacitive dielectrics for harsh-environment applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer film capacitors have been widely used in electronics and electrical power systems due to their advantages of high power densities, fast charge&#8211;discharge speed, and great stability. However, the exponential increase of electrical conduction with temperature and applied electric field substantially degrades the capacitive performance of dielectric polymers at elevated temperatures. Here, the first example of controlling the energy level of charge traps in all-organic crosslinked polymers by tailoring molecular structures that significantly inhibit high-field high-temperature conduction loss, which largely differs from current approaches based on the introduction of inorganic fillers, is reported. The polymer network with optimized crosslinking structures exhibits an ultrahigh discharged energy density of 7.02&#8201;J&#8201;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt; with charge/discharge efficiencies of &amp;gt;90% at 150&#160;&#176;C, far outperforming current dielectric polymers and composites. The charge-trapping effects in different crosslinked structures, as the origins of the marked improvements in the high-temperature capacitive performance, are comprehensively investigated experimentally and confirmed computationally. Moreover, excellent cyclability and self-healing features are demonstrated in the polymer film capacitors. This work offers a promising pathway of molecular structure design to scalable high-energy-density polymer dielectrics capable of operating under harsh environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhancing Electron Correlation at a 3D Ferromagnetic Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Does adatom adsorption on the surface of a 3D ferromagnet influence electron correlation? A far from trivial question! Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art theoretical and experimental methods, it is found that an iron surface in contact with oxygen represents a moderately correlated system with some features in between metallic Fe and the Mott insulator FeO.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy and theoretical calculations are combined beyond the one&#8208;electron approximation to unveil the spin&#8208;dependent electronic structure of the interface formed between iron (Fe) and an ordered oxygen (O) atomic layer, and an adsorbate&#8208;induced enhancement of electronic correlations is found. It is demonstrated that this enhancement is responsible for a drastic narrowing of the Fe d&#8208;bands close to the Fermi energy (EF) and a reduction of the exchange splitting, which is not accounted for in the Stoner picture of ferromagnetism. In addition, correlation leads to a significant spin&#8208;dependent broadening of the electronic bands at higher binding energies and their merging with satellite features, which are manifestations of a pure many&#8208;electron behavior. Overall, adatom adsorption can be used to vary the material parameters of transition metal surfaces to access different intermediate electronic correlated regimes, which will otherwise not be accessible. The results show that the concepts developed to understand the physics and chemistry of adsorbate&#8211;metal interfaces, relevant for a variety of research areas, from spintronics to catalysis, need to be reconsidered with many&#8208;particle effects being of utmost importance. These may affect chemisorption energy, spin transport, magnetic order, and even play a key role in the emergence of ferromagnetism at interfaces between non&#8208;magnetic systems.

         <title>N &#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) Acetamide Additive Enables Phase&#8208;Pure and Stable &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 for Efficient Self&#8208;Powered Photodetectors</title>

         <dc:description>
A facile strategy to obtain phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The additive reduces the potential barrier in the phase transition process, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure&#160;&#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. The resultant self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits superior performance.








Abstract
Formamidinium&#8211;lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite is considered as one of the most promising perovskite materials for high&#8208;performance photodetectors because of its narrow bandgap and superior thermal stability. Nevertheless, to realize efficient carrier transport and highly performing photodetectors, it imposes the requirement of fabricating &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 with pure phase, preferred crystal orientation, large grain size, and passivated interface, which still remains challenging. Here, a facile strategy based on additive engineering to obtain pure&#8208;phase FAPbI3 perovskite films by introducing N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide into perovskite precursors is reported. The formation of chemical bond and hydrogen bond between N&#8208;(2&#8208;aminoethyl) acetamide and perovskite reduces the potential barrier in the phase&#8208;transition process from an intermediate yellow phase to a final black phase, passivates the defects of the film, and leads to a high&#8208;quality and phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite. A self&#8208;powered photodetector based on the as&#8208;fabricated FAPbI3 film exhibits a maximum responsivity of 0.48 A W&#8722;1 at 700&#160;nm with a peak external quantum efficiency&#160;of 95% at 440&#160;nm. Moreover, the optimized device remains 83% of the initial performance after 576&#160;h storage at ambient condition. This work provides a simple and feasible scheme for the preparation of high&#8208;quality phase&#8208;pure &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 perovskite and associated devices.

         <title>Ultrastable Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Fuel Cell Electrocatalysts by Eliminating Non&#8208;Coordinating Nitrogen and Regulating Coordination Structures at High Temperatures</title>

Abstract
Pyrolyzed Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C materials have attracted considerable interests as one of the most active noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). Despite significant progress has been made in improving their catalytic activity during past decades, the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts still suffer from fairly poor electrochemical and storage stability, which greatly hurdles their practical application. Here, we develop an effective strategy to greatly improve their catalytic stability in PEMFCs and storage stability by virtue of previously&#8208;unexplored high&#8208;temperature synthetic chemistry between 1100&#8211;1200&#176;C. Pyrolysis at this rarely adopted temperature range not only enables the elimination of less active nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon sites that generate detrimental peroxide byproducts but also regulates the coordination structure of Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C from less stable D1 (O&#8211;FeN4C12) to a more stable D2 structure (FeN4C10). The optimized Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalyst exhibits excellent stability in PEMFCs (&gt; 80% performance retention after 30 hours under H2/O2 condition) and no activity loss after 35&#8208;day storage while maintaining a competitive ORR activity and PEMFC performance.

         <title>Key Factors Affecting the Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review intensively discusses the stability issues and strategies to overcome in CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot solar (PQD) cells. The detailed degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs are provided from the material and device architectural viewpoints. Furthermore, related design strategies for stable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells along with possible future perspectives are proposed.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells shows increase from 10.77% to 16.2% in a short period owing to advances in material and device design for solar cells. However, the device stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells remains poor in ambient conditions, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs solar cells in terms of both inherent material properties and device characteristics. Along with this analysis, advanced strategies to overcome poor device stability must be conceived. In this review, fundamental mechanisms that cause the degradation of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells are discussed from the material property and device viewpoints. In addition, based on detailed insights into degradation mechanisms in CsPbI3 PQD solar cells, various strategies are introduced to improve the stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are presented to achieve highly durable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. The investigation of the degradation mechanisms and the stability enhancement strategies can pave the way for the commercialization of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells.

         <title>New Approaches to Produce Large&#8208;Area Single Crystal Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review introduces novel synthetic strategies to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials and discusses the technological challenges of dealing with the isostructured crystals (3D materials such as metals, III&#8208;V semiconductors, oxide perovskites, halide perovskites, organic semiconductors) and the anisotropic crystals (2D materials such as graphene, hBN, and metal chalcogenides).








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of single crystal thin films of metals, semiconductors, and insulators is crucial for manufacturing high&#8208;performance electronic and optical devices, but still challenging from both scientific and industrial perspectives. Recently, unconventional advanced synthetic approaches have been attempted and have made remarkable progress in diversifying the species of producible single crystal thin films. This review introduces several new synthetic approaches to produce large&#8208;area single crystal thin films of various materials according to the concepts and principles.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Powered Dielectrophoretic Microparticle Manipulation Platform Based on a Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;powered DEP microparticle manipulation platform based on a triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) is proposed, which performs high&#8208;efficiency cell separation. This work provides an ideal scheme for improving the portability of microfluidic chips and is beneficial to the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems.








Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems aim to integrate laboratory operations on a miniaturized device with broad application prospects in the field of point&#8208;of&#8208;care testing. However, bulky peripheral power resources, such as high&#8208;voltage supplies, function generators, and amplifiers, hamper the commercialization of the system. In this work, a portable, self&#8208;powered microparticle manipulation platform based on triboelectrically driven dielectrophoresis (DEP) is reported. A rotary freestanding triboelectric nanogenerator (RF&#8208;TENG) and rectifier/filter circuit supply a high&#8208;voltage direct&#8208;current signal to form a non&#8208;uniform electric field within the microchannel, realizing controllable actuation of the microparticles through DEP. The operating mechanism of this platform and the control performance of the moving particles are systematically studied and analyzed. Randomly distributed particles converge in a row after passing through the serpentine channel and various particles are separated owing to the different DEP forces. Ultimately, the high&#8208;efficiency separation of live and dead yeast cells is achieved using this platform. RF&#8208;TENG as the power source for lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip exhibits better safety and portability than traditional high&#8208;voltage power sources. This study presents a promising solution for the commercialization of lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip.

         <title>Pt Single Atoms on CrN Nanoparticles Deliver Outstanding Activity and CO Tolerance in the Hydrogen Oxidation Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single&#8208;atom catalysts with novel and small&#8208;sized CrN nanoparticles as potential support is successfully prepared by atomic layer deposition method and exhibit superior activity and CO&#8208;tolerance toward hydrogen oxidation reaction, which is of great significance for the full utilization of low&#8208;cost H2 with impurity CO in proton exchange membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
The large&#8208;scale application of proton exchange membrane fuel cells is currently hampered by high cost of commercial Pt catalysts and their susceptibility to poisoning by CO impurities in H2 feed. In this context, the development of CO&#8208;tolerant electrocatalysts with high Pt atom utilization efficiency for hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) is of critical importance. Herein, Pt single atoms are successfully immobilized on chromium nitride nanoparticles by atomic layer deposition method, denoted as Pt SACs/CrN. Electrochemical tests establish Pt SACs/CrN to be a very efficient HOR catalyst, with a mass activity that is 5.7 times higher than commercial PtRu/C. Strikingly, the excellent performance of Pt SACs/CrN is maintained after introducing 1000&#160;ppm of CO in H2 feed. The excellent CO&#8208;tolerance of Pt SACs/CrN is related to weaker CO adsorption on Pt single atoms. This work provides guidelines for the design and construction of active and CO&#8208;tolerant catalysts for HOR.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in 2D Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upon moderate pressuring, Fe3GeTe2 as a prototypical layered magnet transits into a ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic coexisting state, and the homostructure with an atomically smooth interface exhibits unprecedented exchange bias (ExB) without gradual aging before collapsing via avalanching. The very existence of the non&#8208;aging nature further allows achieving, striking and technologically significant extendability and rechargeability of the ExB.








Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies are mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials, whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here, the enabling power of 2D magnets is exploited to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures, upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations, and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. It is also observed that, negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of oxygen redox in lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. Meanwhile, the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction on metal oxides is interpreted and perspectives on the future development of LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&#63743;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, that is, O&#63743;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.

         <title>Nanoscale TEM Imaging of Hydrogel Network Architecture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct observation of the nanoscale polymer network of hydrogels is essential in understanding its properties. Herein, for the first time, a novel staining and structure fixation method is developed for transmission electron microscopy&#160;observation to visualize the hydrogel network architecture in its unperturbed conformation. The revealed molecular structures provide important insights for the friction, adhesion, and fracture of hydrogels.








Abstract
In this work, the authors succeed in direct visualization of the network structure of synthetic hydrogels with transmission electron microscopy (TEM) by developing a novel staining and network fixation method. Such a direct visualization is not carried out because sample preparation and obtaining sufficient contrast are challenging for these soft materials. TEM images reveal robust heterogeneous network architectures at mesh size scale and defects at micro&#8208;scale. TEM images also reveal the presence of abundant dangling chains on the surface of the hydrogel network. The real space structural information provides a comprehensive perspective that links bulk properties with a nanoscale network structure, including fracture, adhesion, sliding friction, and lubrication. The presented method has the potential to advance the field.

         <title>Core&#8211;Shell Engineering of Conductive Fillers toward Enhanced Dielectric Properties: A Universal Polarization Mechanism in Polymer Conductor Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new polarization mechanism based on electron displacement across a filler&#8208;cluster is developed, which can quantitatively explain dielectric behaviors of percolative polymer composites. With the guidance, a novel design principle, via the manipulation of filler structure and composite morphology, to achieve desirable dielectric properties is demonstrated. The composite design is fundamentally different from traditional approaches based on filler&#8211;polymer interfaces.








Abstract
Flexible dielectric and electronic materials with high dielectric constant (k) and low loss are constantly pursued. Encapsulation of conductive fillers with insulating shells represents a promising approach, and has attracted substantial research efforts. However, progress is greatly impeded due to the lack of a fundamental understanding of the polarization mechanism. In this work, a series of core&#8211;shell polymer composites is studied, and the correlation between macroscopic dielectric properties (across entire composites) and microscopic polarization (around single fillers) is investigated. It is revealed that the polarization in polymer conductor composites is determined by electron transport across multiple neighboring conductive fillers&#8212;a domain&#8208;type polarization. The formation of a core&#8211;shell filler structure affects the dielectric properties of tpolymer composites by essentially modifying the filler&#8208;cluster size. Based on this understanding, a novel percolative composite is prepared with higher&#8208;than&#8208;normal filler concentration and optimized shell's electrical resistivity. The developed composite shows both high&#8208;k due to enlarged cluster size and low loss due to restrained charge transport simultaneously, which cannot be achieved in traditional percolative composites or via simple core&#8211;shell filler design. The revealed polarization mechanism and the optimization strategy for core&#8211;shell fillers provide critical guidance and a new paradigm, for developing advanced polymer dielectrics with promising property sets.

         <title>In Situ Nucleation&#8208;Decoupled and Site&#8208;Specific Incorporation of &#197;&#8208;Scale Pores in Graphene Via Epoxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanosized epoxy clusters form on graphene surface upon exposure to ozone near room temperature. When sufficient energy is supplied, clusters gasify forming nanopores. The energy barrier is measured for cluster formation as 0.42&#160;eV and for cluster gasification in the pore as 1.3&#160;eV. The approach allows decoupling of pore nucleation (pore density) and expansion (pore size).








Abstract
Generating pores in graphene by decoupled nucleation and expansion is desired to achieve a fine control over the porosity, and is desired to advance several applications. Herein, epoxidation is introduced, which is the formation of nanosized epoxy clusters on the graphitic lattice as nucleation sites without forming pores. In&#160;situ gasification of clusters inside a transmission electron microscope shows that pores are generated precisely at the site of the clusters by surpassing an energy barrier of 1.3&#160;eV. Binding energy predictions using ab initio calculations combined with the cluster nucleation theory reveal the structure of the epoxy clusters and indicate that the critical cluster is an epoxy dimer. Finally, it is shown that the cluster gasification can be manipulated to form &#197;&#8208;scale pores which then effectively sieve gas molecules based on their size. This decoupled cluster nucleation and pore formation will likely pave the way for an independent control of pore size and density.

         <title>An Effective Sneak&#8208;Path Solution Based on a Transient&#8208;Relaxation Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy in which&#160;the transient relaxation in a type of dynamic selector made from unipolar volatile memristors is harnessed to effectively address&#160;the sneak&#8208;path problem in memristor arrays is demonstrated.








Abstract
An efficient strategy for addressing individual devices is required to unveil the full potential of memristors for high&#8208;density memory and computing applications. Existing strategies using two&#8208;terminal selectors that are preferable for compact integration have trade&#8208;offs in reduced generality or functional window. A strategy that applies to broad memristors and maintains their full&#8208;range functional window is proposed. This strategy uses a type of unipolar switch featuring a transient relaxation or retention as the selector. The unidirectional current flow in the switch suppresses the sneak&#8208;path current, whereas the transient&#8208;relaxation window is exploited for bidirectional programming. A unipolar volatile memristor with ultralow switching voltage (e.g., &lt;100&#160;mV), constructed from a protein nanowire dielectric harvested from Geobacter sulfurreducens, is specifically employed as the example switch to highlight the advantages and scalability in the strategy for array integration.

         <title>Activating Organic Phosphorescence via Heavy Metal&#8211;&#960; Interaction Induced Intersystem Crossing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cocrystallization strategy is developed to enable efficient room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the organic dye with a remarkable photoluminescence quantum yield of 25.1 &#177; 1%. This strategy to brighten the triplet state of organic chromophores may be quite general and open up a new avenue for designing innovative phosphorescent materials.








Abstract
Heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;containing clusters, nanocrystals, and other semiconductors can sensitize the triplet states of their surface&#8208;bonded chromophores, but the energy loss, such as nonradiative deactivation, often prevents the synergistic light emission in their solid&#8208;state coassemblies. Cocrystallization allows new combinations of molecules with complementary properties for achieving functionalities not available in single components. Here, the cocrystal formation that employs platinum(II) acetylacetonate (Pt(acac)2) as a triplet sensitizer and electron&#8208;deficient 1,4,5,8&#8208;naphthalene&#160;diimides (NDIs) as organic phosphors is reported. The hybrid cocrystals exhibit room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence confined in the low&#8208;lying, long&#8208;lived triplet state of NDIs with photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (&#934;PL) exceeding 25% and a phosphorescence lifetime (&#964;Ph) of 156 &#181;s. This remarkable PL property benefits from the noncovalent electronic and spin&#8211;orbital coupling between the constituents.

         <title>A Template Editing Strategy to Create Interlayer&#8208;Confined Active Species for Efficient and Durable Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER&#8208;related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, we proposed a template editing strategy to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, we selectively edited two types of NiO6 units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4&#8208;benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks by chemical etching&#8208;assisted electroxidation to create layered &#947;&#8208;NiOOH with intercalated Ni&#8208;O species. In such an interlayer&#8208;confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high&#8208;density intercalated Ni&#8208;O species, which also suppress the undesirable &#947; to &#946; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130 mV and affords 1000 h stability at 100 mA cm&#8722;2. Our strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous&#8208;like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Substantial overpotentials and insufficient and unstable active sites of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalysts limit their efficiency and stability in OER-related energy conversion and storage technologies. Here, we proposed a template editing strategy to graft highly active catalytic species onto highly conductive rigid frameworks to tackle this challenge. As a successful attempt, we selectively edited two types of NiO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; units of layered Ni BDC (BDC stands for 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid) metal organic frameworks by chemical etching-assisted electroxidation to create layered &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-NiOOH with intercalated Ni-O species. In such an interlayer-confined intercalated architecture, the large interlayer space with high ion permeability offers an ideal reaction region to sufficiently expose the OER active sites comprising high-density intercalated Ni-O species, which also suppress the undesirable &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;&#946;&lt;/i&gt; phase transformation, thus exhibiting efficient and durable OER activity. As a result, water oxidation can occur at an extremely low overpotential of 130 mV and affords 1000 h stability at 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our strategy conceptually shows the possibility of achieving stable homogeneous-like catalysis in heterogeneous catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Microdomain Interlocking Polymer Electrolytes for Advanced All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Battery Chemistries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rational concept of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking all&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes is designed by introducing newly polymerized multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide. The tailor&#8208;made electrolyte shows advanced mechanical, electrochemical, and thermodynamic performances, stably enabling all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li metal symmetrical cell cycles over 4000&#160;h.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state polymer electrolytes (ASPEs) with excellent processivity are considered one of the most forward&#8208;looking materials for large&#8208;scale industrialization. However, the contradiction between improving the mechanical strength and accelerating the ionic migration of ASPEs has always been difficult to reconcile. Herein, a rational concept is raised of high&#8208;entropy microdomain interlocking ASPEs (HEMI&#8208;ASPEs), inspired by entropic elasticity well&#8208;known in polymer and biochemical sciences, by introducing newly designed multifunctional ABC miktoarm star terpolymers into polyethylene oxide for the first time. The tailor&#8208;made HEMI&#8208;ASPEs possess multifunctional polymer chains, which induce themselves to assemble into micro&#8208; and nanoscale dynamic interlocking networks with high topological structure entropy. HEMI&#8208;ASPEs achieve excellent toughness, considerable ionic conductivity, an appreciable lithium transference number (0.63), and desirable thermal stability (Td&#160;&gt; 400&#160;&#176;C) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries. The Li|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li symmetrical cell shows a stable Li plating/stripping performance over 4000&#160;h, and a LiFePO4|HEMI&#8208;ASPE&#8208;Li|Li full cell exhibits a high capacity retention (&#8776;96%) after 300 cycles. This work contributes an innovative design concept introducing high&#8208;entropy supramolecular dynamic networks for ASPEs.

         <title>Unravelling the Interfacial Dynamics of Bandgap Funneling in Bismuth&#8208;Based Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interfacial dynamics and electrochemical interactions of hybrid perovskites prepared by an anion&#8208;exchange process in the photoelectrochemical system is investigated through computational simulation, experimental photophysical, and (photo)electrochemical analysis. The synergically interfacial dynamics and electrochemical analysis help to discover the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials.








Abstract
An environmentally friendly mixed&#8208;halide perovskite MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx with a bandgap funnel structure has been developed. However, the dynamic interfacial interactions of bandgap funneling in MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;xIx perovskites in the photoelectrochemical (PEC) system remain ambiguous. In light of this, single&#8208; and mixed&#8208;halide lead&#8208;free bismuth&#8208;based hybrid perovskites&#8212;MA3Bi2Cl9&#8722;yIy and MA3Bi2I9 (named MBCl&#8208;I and MBI)&#8212;in the presence and absence of the bandgap funnel structure, respectively, are prepared. Using temperature&#8208;dependent transient photoluminescence and electrochemical voltammetric techniques, the photophysical and (photo)electrochemical phenomena of solid&#8211;solid and solid&#8211;liquid interfaces for MBCl&#8208;I and MBI halide perovskites are therefore confirmed. Concerning the mixed&#8208;halide hybrid perovskites MBCl&#8208;I with a bandgap funnel structure, stronger electronic coupling arising from an enhanced overlap of electronic wavefunctions results in more efficient exciton transport. Besides, MBCl&#8208;I's effective diffusion coefficient and electron&#8208;transfer rate demonstrate efficient heterogeneous charge transfer at the solid&#8211;liquid interface, generating improved photoelectrochemical hydrogen production. Consequently, this combination of photophysical and electrochemical techniques opens up an avenue to explore the intrinsic and interfacial properties of semiconductor materials for elucidating the correlation between material characterization and device performance.

         <title>Large Harvested Energy by Self&#8208;excited Liquid Suspension Triboelectric Nanogenerator with Optimized Charge Transportation Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To enhance the durability of triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG), liquid lubrication has been used to reduce mechanical abrasion. However, as the charge transportation behavior in dielectric liquid is not clearly understood, the output energy is still low although some improvements have been reported. Herein, we systematically investigate the charge transportation behaviors in dielectric liquid by self&#8208;excited liquid suspension triboelectric nanogenerator (LS&#8208;TENG). We find the important role of solid&#8208;liquid triboelectrification effect, charge&#8208;liquid transmission and dissipation effect, and the homogeneous dielectric induction effect in promoting its output performance. The LS&#8208;TENG with a dual dielectric tribolayer has advantages of slight driving force and long lifetime for harvesting micro energy. The output of LS&#8208;TENG remains almost constant for more than 234 k operating cycles. A high charge density of 704 &#956;C m&#8722;2 is obtained, 2.7 times as much as that of current highest record in non&#8208;contact TENG. Additionally, the rotary LS&#8208;TENG lights up 4,200 LEDs and continuously powers a variety of wireless sensors by harvesting wind energy at low wind speed. This work provides an important insight towards the charge transportation mechanism in dielectric liquid, and a prospective strategy for achieving high robust TENG in micro energy harvesting for practical applications.

         <title>A Highly Crystalline Single Layer Two&#8208;dimensional Polymer for Low Variability and Excellent Scalability Molecular Memristors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Large&#8208;scale growth of highly crystalline single layer two&#8208;dimensional polymers (SL&#8208;2DPs) and their subsequent integration into memristors is key to advancing the development of high&#8208;density data storage devices. However, leakage problems resulting from the porous structure of 2DPs continue to make such advances extremely challenging. Herein, we overcome this issue by incorporating long alkoxy chains into key molecular building blocks to obtain a highly crystalline 2DP, as visualized by scanning tunnelling microscopy, and prevent metal permeation in the subsequent device fabrication process. SL&#8208;2DP memristors constructed via direct evaporation of the top electrodes exhibit low variability (&#963;Vset = 0.14) due to the single&#8208;monomer&#8208;thick feature together with the high regular structure and coordination ability which minimizes the stochastic spatial distribution of conductive filaments (CFs) in both vertical and lateral dimensions. The variability was further decreased to 0.04 by confining the formation and fracture of CFs to the interface through the utilization of bilayer junctions. Using peak force tunnelling atomic force microscopy, we demonstrate the nanometre scalability (&lt; 50 nm2) and low power consumption of these molecular memristor devices.

         <title>Functional MXene&#8208;Based Materials for Next&#8208;Generation Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategies that developed to functionalize MXene&#8208;based materials, including tailoring their microstructure by ions/molecules/polymers&#8208;initiated interaction or self&#8208;assembly, surface/interface engineering with dopants or functional groups, constructing heterostructures from MXenes with various materials, and transforming them into a series of derivatives inheriting the merits of the MXene precursors, are highlighted.








Abstract

Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) have piqued global research interest because of their unprecedented safety and high energy density. Significant advances have been made in achieving high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity and good air stability of solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs), mitigating the challenges at the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, and developing feasible manufacturing processes. Along with the advances in fundamental study, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells using inorganic SSEs have been widely demonstrated, revealing their immense potential for industrialization. This Review provides an overview of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells, focusing on ultrathin solid&#8208;state electrolyte membranes, sheet&#8208;type thick solid&#8208;state electrodes, and bipolar stacking. Moreover, several critical parameters directly influencing the energy density of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;ion and Li&#8208;S pouch cells are outlined. Finally, perspectives on all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells are provided and specific metrics to meet certain energy density targets are specified. With this Review, we look to facilitate the development of inorganic all&#8208;solid&#8208;state pouch cells with high energy density and excellent safety.

         <title>Chiral&#8208;Selective Antigen&#8208;Presentation by Supramolecular Chiral Polymer Micelles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chirality is ubiquitous in biological systems, which is closely related to biological functions, life process, and even pathogenesis of diseases. However, the interface between the chirality of synthetic materials and organisms, particularly the immune system, remains poorly understood. Here, supramolecular chiral polymer micelles (SCPMs) are prepared by complexing antigenic proteins with chiral amino acid modified polyethyleneimine. The introduction of chirality not only reduces the toxicity of cationic polymer, but also benefits cell uptake and antigen presentation. Especially, D&#8208;chirality presents the lowest cytotoxicity, while promotes the highest expression level of costimulatory molecules on dendritic cells compared to L&#8208;chirality and achirality. The superiority of D&#8208;chirality to stimulate dendritic cell maturation is supported by immunization with D&#8208;SCPMs, which achieves significant antigen&#8208;specific proliferation of T cells in the spleen, lymph nodes and tumor of mice. Chirality&#8208;mediated antigen processing and presentation is demonstrated by D&#8208;SCPMs self&#8208;assembled from chiral alkaline histidine or neutral phenylalanine modified polyethyleneimine and tumor associated ovalbumin or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 spike 1 antigenic protein. Immunoactivation enabled by D&#8208;chirality opens a window to prepare potent nanotherapeutics for disease prevention and treatment.

         <title>Functional Coating from Amyloid Superwetting Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amyloid fibrils are used as scaffolds for multifunctional films for different applications, including oil/water separation, antifouling, and antifogging materials. Enzyme immobilization on amyloid&#8208;modified surfaces further enables biocatalytic oxidation and degradation of target compounds, extending use to bio&#8208;based applications.








Abstract
Tailoring the hydrophilicity of solid surfaces with a strong affinity to water has been extensively explored in the last 20 years, but studies have been limited to the single function of wettability. Here, the multifunctional properties of tailored surface films are extended from exhibiting superwettability to facilitating biological activities. It is shown that amyloid fibrils can be universally coated onto various substrates, such as fabrics (non&#8208;woven organic masks), metal meshes, polyethersulfone (PES), glass, and more, endowing the resulting surfaces with excellent performance in oil/water mixture and emulsion separation, antifouling, and antifogging. Moreover, the biocompatible crosslinked amyloid fibril coatings can serve as a platform for biocatalytic activities by immobilizing enzymes, as shown in the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;azino&#8208;bis (3&#8208;ethylbenzothiazoline&#8208;6&#8208;sulphonic acid) diammonium salt (ABTS) oxidation and Reactive Black 5 (RB5)&#160;degradation by laccase from Trametes versicolor. The study provides a universal approach to modifying surface morphology and chemical properties via fibrous protein templates, opening the way to unexplored bio&#8208;based applications and functionalities.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Skyrmions and Large Topological Hall Effect in Chromium Telluride Engineered by Self&#8208;Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions and large topological Hall effect are demonstrated in chromium telluride. The Curie temperature and magnetic anisotropy in Cr1+xTe2 can be controlled by the self&#8208;intercalate concentration x. In Cr1.53Te2, which has a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937;&#160;cm are observed.








Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature magnetic skyrmion materials exhibiting robust topological Hall effect (THE) are crucial for novel nano&#8208;spintronic devices. However, such skyrmion&#8208;hosting materials are rare in nature. In this study, a self&#8208;intercalated transition metal dichalcogenide Cr1+xTe2 with a layered crystal structure that hosts room&#8208;temperature skyrmions and exhibits large THE is reported. By tuning the self&#8208;intercalate concentration, a monotonic control of Curie temperature from 169 to 333&#160;K and a magnetic anisotropy transition from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane to the in&#8208;plane configuration are achieved. Based on the intercalation engineering, room&#8208;temperature skyrmions are successfully created in Cr1.53Te2 with a Curie temperature of 295&#160;K and a relatively weak perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. Remarkably, a skyrmion&#8208;induced topological Hall resistivity as large as &#8776;106&#160;n&#937; cm is observed at 290&#160;K. Moreover, a sign reversal of THE is also found at low temperatures, which can be ascribed to other topological spin textures having an opposite topological charge to that of the skyrmions. Therefore, chromium telluride can be a new paradigm of the skyrmion material family with promising prospects for future device applications.

         <title>Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.








Abstract
The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn&#8208;rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni3Sn) eutectics.

     alt="Extraordinary Solidification Mechanism of Liquid Alloys Under Acoustic Levitation State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Acoustic levitation is an advanced containerless processing technique for simulating a space environment, and provides an effective approach to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. The physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, crystal nucleation, and dendritic and eutectic growth within acoustically levitated droplets are demonstrated comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The acoustic levitation of various materials can be realized by highly intensive ultrasound, which provides a free surface and containerless state for materials processing under space simulation conditions. The nonlinear effects such as acoustic radiation pressure, acoustic streaming, and ultrasonic cavitation open up special access to modulate the fluid dynamics and solidification mechanisms of liquid materials. Here, the physical characteristics of liquid flow, undercooling capability, phase separation, and crystal nucleation and growth within acoustically levitated droplets are explored comprehensively to reveal the extraordinary solidification kinetics of liquid alloys. The sectorial shape oscillations of the 2nd to 10th order modes accompanying internal potential flow are observed for water droplets with modulated ultrasound amplitudes, while the enhanced ultrasound intensity promotes ice nucleation and thus reduces water undercooling. The migration of Sn-rich globules during phase separation of immiscible Al&#8211;Cu&#8211;Sn alloy is dominated by the droplet deformation and rotation related to acoustic levitation. The high undercooling states of liquid Ag&#8211;Cu&#8211;Ge and Ni&#8211;Sn alloys during acoustic levitation result in the refinement of (Ag) dendrites and the formation of anomalous (Ni+Ni&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Sn) eutectics. The ultrasound&#8211;liquid interaction also induces surface waves during the containerless solidification of Ag&#8211;Cu and Ni&#8211;Sn eutectic alloys.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Coexistence of Urbach&#8208;Tail&#8208;Like Localized States and Metallic Conduction Channels in Nitrogen&#8208;Doped 3D Curved Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen doping on 3D curved graphene leads to the coexistence of an Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized state and a metallic state. The dual nature of the electronic states can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.








Abstract
Nitrogen (N) doping is one of the most effective approaches to tailor the chemical and physical properties of graphene. By the interplay between N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene lattices, N&#8208;doped 3D graphene displays superior performance in electrocatalysis and solar&#8208;energy harvesting for energy and environmental applications. However, the electrical transport properties and the electronic states, which are the key factors to understand the origins of the N&#8208;doping effect in 3D graphene, are still missing. The electronic properties of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene are systematically investigated by an electric&#8208;double&#8208;layer transistor method. It is demonstrated that Urbach&#8208;tail&#8208;like localized states are located around the neutral point of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene with the background metallic transport channels. The dual nature of electronic states, generated by the synergistic effect of N dopants and 3D curvature of graphene, can be the electronic origin of the high electrocatalysis, enhanced molecular adsorption, and light absorption of N&#8208;doped 3D graphene.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Responsive Upconversion Nanoprobe with Simultaneously Enhanced Single&#8208;Band Red Luminescence and Phase/Size Control for Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lanthanide based upconversion (UC) nanoprobes are emerged as promising agents for biological applications. And, extending the excitation light to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) instead of the traditional 980/808&#8201;nm light and realizing NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red UC emission is highly demanded for bioimaging application, which has not yet been explored. Here, a new type of NIR&#8208;II (1532&#160;nm) light responsive UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) with enhanced single band red UC emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Through tuning the content of Mn2+ in NaLnF4:Er/Mn, the crystal phase, size and emitting color are readily controlled, and the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) ratio is significantly increased from &#8764;25 to &#8764;300, leading to NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red emission via efficient energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by shell coating to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR&#8208;II light activated red UC bioimaging and NIR&#8208;II light responsive photodynamic therapy (PDT) through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine (ZnPc) were successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR&#8208;II light responsive single band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.

         <title>Engineering Electrodes with Robust Conducting Hydrogel Coating for Neural Recording and Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Coating conventional metallic electrodes with conducting polymers has enabled the essential characteristics required for bioelectronics, such as biocompatibility, electrical conductivity, mechanical compliance and the capacity for structural and chemical functionalization of the bioelectrodes. However, the fragile interface between the conducting polymer and the electrode in wet physiological environment has greatly limited their utility and reliability. Here, we&#160;established a general yet reliable strategy to seamlessly interface conventional electrodes with conducting hydrogel coatings, featuring tissue&#8208;like modulus, highly&#8208;desirable electrochemical properties, robust interface and long&#8208;term reliability. Numerical modelling reveals the role of toughening mechanism, synergy of covalent anchorage of long&#8208;chain polymers and chemical crosslinking, in improving the long&#8208;term robustness of the interface. Through in vivo implantation in freely&#8208;moving mouse models, we&#160;show that stable electrophysiological recording could be achieved, while the conducting hydrogel/electrode interface remained robust during the long&#8208;term low&#8208;voltage electrical stimulation. This simple yet versatile design strategy addresses the long&#8208;standing technical challenges in functional bioelectrode engineering, and opens up new avenues for the next&#8208;generation diagnostic brain&#8208;machine&#160;interfaces.

         <title>A Gate Programmable van der Waals Metal&#8208;Ferroelectric&#8208;Semiconductor Vertical Heterojunction Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ferroelectricity, one of the keys to realize non&#8208;volatile memories owing to the remanent electric polarization, has been an emerging phenomenon in the two&#8208;dimensional (2D) limit. Yet the demonstrations of van der Waals (vdW) memories using 2D ferroelectric materials as an ingredient are very limited. Especially, gate&#8208;tunable ferroelectric vdW memristive device, which holds promises in future multi&#8208;bit data storage applications, remains challenging. Here, we&#160;show a gate&#8208;programmable multi&#8208;state memory by vertically assembling graphite, CuInP2S6, and MoS2 layers into a metal(M)&#8208;ferroelectric(FE)&#8208;semiconductor(S) architecture. The resulted devices seamlessly integrate the functionality of both FE&#8208;memristor (with ON&#8208;OFF ratios exceeding 105 and long&#8208;term retention) and metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor field effect transistor (MOS&#8208;FET). It thus yields a prototype of gate tunable giant electroresistance with multi&#8208;levelled ON&#8208;states in the FE&#8208;memristor in the vertical vdW assembly. First&#8208;principles calculations further reveal that such behaviors originate from the specific band alignment between the FE&#8208;S interface. Our&#160;findings pave the way for the engineering of ferroelectricity&#8208;mediated memories in future implementations of 2D&#160;nanoelectronics.

         <title>Zwitterions Narrow Distribution of Perovskite Quantum Wells for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Efficiency Exceeding 15%</title>

Abstract
While quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) perovskites have emerged as promising semiconductors for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), the broad&#8208;width distribution of quantum wells hinders their efficient energy transfer and electroluminescence performance in blue emission. In particular, the underlying mechanism is closely related to the crystallization kinetics and has yet to be understood. Here for the first time, we systematically investigated the influence of bifunctional zwitterions with different coordination affinity on the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites. The zwitterions could coordinate with Pb2+ and also act as co&#8208;spacer organic species in quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which collectively inhibit the aggregation of colloidal precursors and shorten the distance of quantum wells. Consequently, restricted nucleation of high&#8208;n phases and promoted growth of low&#8208;n phases are achieved with moderately coordinated zwitterions, leading to the final film with a more concentrated n distribution and improved energy transfer efficiency. It thus enables high&#8208;efficiency blue LEDs with a recorded external quantum efficiency of 15.6% at 490&#160;nm, and the operation stability has also been prolonged to 55.3&#160;min. Our results provide useful directions for tuning the crystallization kinetics of quasi&#8208;2D perovskites, which is expected to lead to high&#8208;performance perovskite LEDs.

Abstract
Prompt on&#8208;site diagnosis of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 with other respiratory infections would have minimized the global impact of the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic through rapid, effective management. However, no such multiplex point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC) chip has satisfied a suitable sensitivity of gold&#8208;standard nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs). Here, we present a rapid multiplexed ultrasensitive sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer LAMP (MUSAL) chip operated by simple LED&#8208;driven photothermal amplification to detect six targets from single&#8208;swab sampling. First, our MUSAL chip allows ultrafast on&#8208;chip sample preparation with &#8764;500&#8208;fold preconcentration at a rate of 1.2&#160;mL min&#8722;1. Second, our chip enables contamination&#8208;free amplification using autonomous target elution into on&#8208;chip reagents by photothermal activation. Finally, our chip accomplishes multiplexed on&#8208;chip diagnostics of SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 and influenza viruses with a limit of detection (LoD) of 0.5 copies &#956;L&#8722;1. Our rapid, ultra&#8208;sensitive, cost&#8208;effective sample&#8208;to&#8208;answer chip with a multiplex capability will allow timely management of various pandemics situations we may face shortly.

         <title>Chiral Seeded Growth of Gold Nanorods Into Fourfold Twisted Nanoparticles with Plasmonic Optical Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fourfold twisted Au nanorods can be prepared via chiral seeded growth, using cysteine as a chiral inducer. A high dissymmetry factor is obtained and electromagnetic simulations show chiral plasmon modes with largely asymmetric near&#8208;field enhancement. The mechanism involved in chiral growth is related with cysteine&#8208;induced enantioselective development of chiral facets.








Abstract
A robust and reproducible methodology to prepare stable inorganic nanoparticles with chiral morphology may hold the key to the practical utilization of these materials. An optimized chiral growth method to prepare fourfold twisted gold nanorods is described herein, where the amino acid cysteine is used as a dissymmetry inducer. Four tilted ridges are found to develop on the surface of single&#8208;crystal nanorods upon repeated reduction of HAuCl4, in the presence of cysteine as the chiral inducer and ascorbic acid as a reducing agent. From detailed electron microscopy analysis of the crystallographic structures, it is proposed that the dissymmetry results from the development of chiral facets in the form of protrusions (tilted ridges) on the initial nanorods, eventually leading to a twisted shape. The role of cysteine is attributed to assisting enantioselective facet evolution, which is supported by density functional theory simulations of the surface energies, modified upon adsorption of the chiral molecule. The development of R&#8208;type and S&#8208;type chiral structures (small facets, terraces, or kinks) would thus be non&#8208;equal, removing the mirror symmetry of the Au NR and in turn resulting in a markedly chiral morphology with high plasmonic optical activity.

         <title>Probabilistic Neural Computing with Stochastic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Modern computing assumes that materials, devices, and circuits will be operated in a fully deterministic manner, providing predictable and reliable outputs, with any desired random behavior re&#8208;introduced in software. This perspective describes how the integration of tunable stochastic devices into neuromorphic computing architectures can allow future microelectronics to enable more efficient probabilistic computing calculations for scientific computing and artificial&#8208;intelligence applications.








Abstract
The brain has effectively proven a powerful inspiration for the development of computing architectures in which processing is tightly integrated with memory, communication is event&#8208;driven, and analog computation can be performed at scale. These neuromorphic systems increasingly show an ability to improve the efficiency and speed of scientific computing and artificial intelligence applications. Herein, it is proposed that the brain's ubiquitous stochasticity represents an additional source of inspiration for expanding the reach of neuromorphic computing to probabilistic applications. To date, many efforts exploring probabilistic computing have focused primarily on one scale of the microelectronics stack, such as implementing probabilistic algorithms on deterministic hardware or developing probabilistic devices and circuits with the expectation that they will be leveraged by eventual probabilistic architectures. A co&#8208;design vision is described by which large numbers of devices, such as magnetic tunnel junctions and tunnel diodes, can be operated in a stochastic regime and incorporated into a scalable neuromorphic architecture that can impact a number of probabilistic computing applications, such as Monte Carlo simulations and Bayesian neural networks. Finally, a framework is presented to categorize increasingly advanced hardware&#8208;based probabilistic computing technologies.

         <title>Cancer&#8208;Cell&#8208;Biomimetic Nanoparticles for Targeted Therapy of Multiple Myeloma Based on Bone Marrow Homing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The insufficient delivery of drug limits the therapeutic effect of multiple myeloma. A myeloma cell&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier, which can enter bone marrow based on bone marrow homing and target tumor cells through homologous targeting, is developed. Thus, the amount of drug available at the myeloma site in the bone marrow is increased and an enhanced therapeutic effect is achieved.








Abstract
Multiple myeloma (MM) is the second most common hematological malignancy. It is characterized by abnormal transformation and uncontrolled clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells in the bone marrow (BM), which can destroy bone structure and inhibit hematopoiesis. Although there are new therapeutic methods, they are not curative, mainly because it is difficult to deliver an effective amount of drug to BM, leading to a failure to eradicate MM cells inside the BM. BM homing is an important and unique characteristic of MM cells and it is mainly affected by surface molecules on the tumor cell membrane. Inspired by this mechanism, an MM&#8208;mimicking nanocarrier is developed by coating bortezomib (BTZ)&#8208;loaded poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8211;poly(ethylene glycol)&#8211;poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone) (PCEC) nanoparticles with the MM cell membrane. The MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can enter the BM based on BM homing as a &#8220;Trojan horse&#8221; and target the tumor cells through homologous targeting. In this way, drug availability at the myeloma site is enhanced so as to inhibit MM growth. In addition, these MM&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles can escape phagocytosis by the MPS and have a long circulation effect. The in vivo therapeutic results demonstrate an excellent treatment efficacy for MM. Accordingly, this strategy may be a promising platform for the treatment of MM.

         <title>Ultrahigh Molecular Weight Polyethylene Lamellar&#8208;Thin Framework on Square Meter Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with square meter lateral size by commodity polymer is introduced. This macroscopic low&#8208;dimensional material is highly transparent optically and electronically, sub&#8208;micrometer&#8208;porous, and self&#8208;standing with Young's modulus of gigapascal level. Its potential applications include separation process and flexible electronics.








Abstract
A new member of low&#8208;dimensional structures with a high aspect ratio (LDHA) is introduced. For the first time, commodity polymer is processed into LDHA, which has long been stagnated by the lack of suitable processing techniques. The key to solve the current bottleneck is to overcome the trade&#8208;off between kinetic processability and thermodynamic stability. These two factors are both highly determined by intermolecular interaction level (IIL). Thus with a wide tuning range of IIL, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) is selected and investigated to break through the trade&#8208;off. Polymeric LDHA preparation needs both thinning and stiffening. By focusing on one then the other sequentially, they are realized simultaneously. Thus the over sixty&#8208;year&#8208;old material is finally thinned down by seven orders of magnitude into a 65.5&#160;nm thick and 0.64 m2 large lamellar&#8208;thin framework (LTF). LTF exhibits a series of exceptional properties such as over&#8208;95% transparency, and seven times higher specific strength referred to steel. For the first time, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo&#8208;EM) is utilized to observe commodity polymers directly. This new LDHA material is promising to expand the scale boundaries of both fundamental research and practical applications, not only for UHMWPE, but also for more commodity polymers to come.

         <title>Catalase&#8208;Mimetic Artificial Biocatalysts with Ru Catalytic Centers for ROS Elimination and Stem&#8208;Cell Protection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Catalase&#8208;mimetic artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers are constructed for reactive oxygen species (ROS) elimination. The activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru catalytic sites are systematically disclosed. Notably, the biocatalysts with Ru clusters present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity, thus providing efficient rescue ability for the survival, adhesion, and differentiation of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS conditions.








Abstract
Exploring high&#8208;efficiency reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;elimination materials is of great importance for combating oxidative stress in diverse diseases, especially stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based biotherapeutics. By mimicking the Fe&#63743;N active centers of natural catalase, here, an innovative concept to design ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts with Ru catalytic centers for stem&#8208;cell protection is reported. The experimental studies and theoretical calculations have systematically disclosed the activity merits and structure diversities of different Ru sites when serving as ROS&#8208;elimination artificial biocatalysts. Benefiting from the metallic electronic structures and synergetic effects of multiple sites, the artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers present exceptional ROS&#8208;elimination activity; notably, it shows much higher catalytic efficiency per Ru atom on decomposing H2O2 when compared to the isolated single&#8208;atom Ru sites, which is more efficient than that of the natural antioxidants and recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art ROS&#8208;scavenging biocatalysts. The systematic stem&#8208;cell protection studies reveal that the catalase&#8208;like artificial biocatalysts can provide efficient rescue ability for survival, adhesion, and differentiation functions of human mesenchymal stem cells in high ROS level conditions. It is suggested that applying these artificial biocatalysts with Ru cluster centers will offer a new pathway for engineering high&#8208;performance ROS&#8208;scavenging materials in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics and many other ROS&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>A Lysosome&#8208;Activated Tetrahedral Nanobox for Encapsulated siRNA Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tetrahedral nanobox, a kind of dynamic framework nucleic acid nanocarrier, is fabricated to completely encapsulate target siRNA and realize controllable delivery of cargo strands upon a pH&#8208;responsive switch. Based on the protective encapsulation against degradation and detachment during delivery and final active release in cells, excellent gene&#8208;silencing effects are achieved for in vitro and in vivo experiments.








Abstract
Tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have attracted extensive attention as drug nanocarriers because of their excellent cellular uptake. However, for oligonucleotide cargos, tFNA mainly acts as a static delivery platform generated via sticky&#8208;ended ligation. Here, inspired by the original stable space inside the tetrahedral scaffold, a dynamic lysosome&#8208;activated tFNA nanobox is fabricated for completely encapsulating a short interfering RNA (siRNA) of interest. The closed tetrahedral structure endows cargo siRNA with greater resistance against RNase and serum and enables solid integration with the vehicle during delivery. Moreover, the pH&#8208;responsive switch of nanobox allows the controlled release of siRNA upon entry into lysosomes at cell culture temperature. Based on protective loading and active unloading, an excellent silencing effect on the target tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF&#945;) gene is achieved in in vitro and in vivo experiments. Conclusively, the nanobox offers a dynamic pH&#8208;sensitive confinement delivery system for siRNA and can be an extendable strategy for other small RNA.

         <title>Water&#8208;Triggered Stiffening of Shape&#8208;Memory Polyurethanes Composed of Hard Backbone Dangling PEG Soft Segments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the thermally triggered phase transformation process and &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition achieved by lattice distortion of shape&#8208;memory alloys, a series of water&#8208;triggered stiffening shape&#8208;memory polyurethanes is developed. They can achieve &#8220;soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff&#8221; transition by forming more continuous hard domains upon hydration.








Abstract
Shape&#8208;memory polymers (SMPs) induced by heat or water are commonly used candidates for biomedical applications. Shape recovery inevitably leads to a dramatic decrease of Young's modulus due to the enhanced flexibility of polymer chains at the transition temperature. Herein, the principle of phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced stiffening of shape&#8208;memory metallic alloys (SMAs) is introduced to the design of molecular structures for shape&#8208;memory polyurethane (SMPUs), featuring all&#8208;hard segments composed of main chains that are attached with poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) dangling side chains. Different from conventional SMPs, they achieve a soft&#8208;to&#8208;stiff transition when shape recovers. The stiffening process is driven by water&#8208;triggered segmental rearrangement due to the incompatibility between the hard segments and the soft PEG segments. Upon hydration, the extent of microphase separation is enhanced and the hard domains are transformed to a more continuous morphology to realize more effective stress transfer. Meanwhile, such segmental rearrangement facilitates the shape&#8208;recovery process in the hydrated state despite the final increased glass transition temperature (Tg). This work represents a novel paradigm of simultaneously integrating balanced mechanics, shape&#8208;memory property, and biocompatibility for SMPUs as materials for minimally invasive surgery such as endoluminal stents.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Type SrVO3 as High&#8208;Performance Anode Materials for Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite SrVO3 is investigated as a Li&#8208;ion battery anode material. Thanks to the high intrinsic electronic and ionic conductivities, commercial thick and conducting additive&#8208;free perovskite SrVO3 electrodes are constructed and electrochemical performance with high gravimetric/areal/volumetric capacities, high&#8208;rate capability, and high cycling stability is delivered.








Abstract
Perovskite&#8208;type oxides, characterized by excellent multifunctional physical and chemical properties, are widely used in ferroelectric, piezoelectric, energy conversion, and storage applications. It is shown here that the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 can achieve excellent electrochemical performance as lithium&#8208;ion battery anodes thanks to its high electrically and ionically conductivity. Conducting additive&#8208;free SrVO3 electrodes can deliver a high specific capacity of 324 mAh g&#8722;1 at a safe and low average working potential of &#8776;0.9 V vs Li/Li+ together with excellent high&#8208;rate performance. A high areal capacity of &#8776;5.4 mAh cm&#8722;2 is obtained using an ultrathick (&#8776;120 &#956;m) electrode. Moreover, the fully lithiated SrVO3 electrode exhibits only 2.3% volume expansion that is explained by a simple solid&#8208;solution Li+&#8208;storage mechanism, resulting in good cycling stability of the electrode. This study highlights the perovskite&#8208;type SrVO3 as a promising Li+&#8208;storage anode and provides opportunities for exploring a variety of perovskite oxides as next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;ion battery anodes.

         <title>A Two&#8208;Pathway Model for the Evolution of Colloidal Compound Semiconductor Quantum Dots and Magic&#8208;Size Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;pathway model has been proposed for the evolution of colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). One unique intermediate called &#8220;precursor compound&#8221; (PC) is discovered to transform to its magic&#8208;size cluster (MSC) counterpart via intramolecular reorganization. PCs can be engineered to selectively produce either ultrasmall QDs with enhanced particle yield or various MSCs, with an unprecedented high degree of control.








Abstract
A fundamental understanding of formation pathways is critical to the controlled synthesis of colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals. As ultrasmall&#8208;size quantum dots (QDs) sometimes emerge in reactions along with magic&#8208;size clusters (MSCs), distinguishing their individual pathway of evolution is important, but has proven difficult. To decouple the evolution of QDs and MSCs, an unconventional, selective approach has been developed, along with a two&#8208;pathway model that provides a fundamental understanding of production selectivity. For on&#8208;demand production of either ultrasmall QDs or MSCs, the key enabler is in how to allow a reaction to proceed in the time prior to nucleation and growth of QDs. In this prenucleation stage, an intermediate compound forms, which is the precursor compound (PC) to the MSC. Here, the two&#8208;pathway model and the manipulation of such PCs to synthesize either ultrasmall QDs or binary and ternary MSCs are highlighted. The two&#8208;pathway model will assist the development of nucleation theory as well as provide a basis for a mechanism&#8208;enabled design and predictive synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>A Tetrahedral Framework DNA&#8208;Based Bioswitchable miRNA Inhibitor Delivery System: Application to Skin Anti&#8208;Aging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed. BiRDS maximizes miR inhibitors&#8217; loading capacity while retaining the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. The excellent editability of the BiRDS confers it the potential to significantly improve the stability and delivery efficiency of miR inhibitors.








Abstract
MicroRNA (miR)&#8208;based therapy shows strong potential; however, structural limitations pose a challenge in fully exploiting its biomedical functionality. Tetrahedral framework DNA (tFNA) has proven to be an ideal vehicle for miR therapy. Inspired by the ancient Chinese myth &#8220;Sun and Immortal Birds,&#8221; a novel bioswitchable miR inhibitor delivery system (BiRDS) is designed with three miR inhibitors (the three immortal birds) and a nucleic acid core (the central sun). The BiRDS fuses miR inhibitors within the framework, maximizing their loading capacity, while allowing the system to retain the characteristics of small&#8208;sized tFNA and avoiding uncertainty associated with RNA exposure in traditional loading protocols. The RNase H&#8208;responsive sequence at the tail of each &#8220;immortal bird&#8221; enables the BiRDS to transform from a 3D to a 2D structure upon entering cells, promoting the delivery of miR inhibitors. To confirm the application potential, the BiRDS is used to deliver the miR&#8208;31 inhibitor, with antiaging effects on hair follicle stem cells, into a skin aging model. Superior skin penetration ability and RNA delivery are observed with significant anti&#8208;aging effects. These findings demonstrate the capability and editability of the BiRDS to improve the stability and delivery efficacy of miRs for future innovations.

         <title>Mucosa&#8208;Like Conformal Hydrogel Coating for Aqueous Lubrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious yet feasible method of creating a mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating, which is soft, lubricative, hydrophilic, antifouling, biocompatible, and stable, is reported. This coating effectively reduces intubation&#8208;related complications. This work represents a breakthrough to endow interventional medical devices with required surface properties, showing promising prospects for clinical translation.








Abstract
Mucosa is a protective and lubricating barrier in biological tissue, which has a great clinical inspiration because of its slippery, soft, and hydrophilic surface. However, mimicking mucosal traits on complex surface remains an enormous challenge. Herein, a novel approach to create mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating is developed. A thin conformal hydrogel layer mimicking the epithelial layer is obtained by first absorbing micelles, followed by forming covalent interlinks with the polymer substrate via interface&#8208;initiated hydrogel polymerization. The resulting coating exhibits uniform thickness (&#8776;15&#160;&#181;m), mucosa&#8208;matched compliance (Young's modulus = 1.1&#160;&#177; 0.1&#160;kPa) and lubrication (coefficients of friction = 0.018&#160;&#177; 0.003), robust interfacial bonding against peeling (peeling strength = 1218.0&#160;&#177; 187.9 J m&#8211;2), as well as high water absorption capacity. It effectively resists adhesion of proteins and bacteria without compromising biocompatibility. As demonstrated by an in vivo cynomolgus monkey model and clinical trial, applications of the mucosa&#8208;like conformal hydrogel coating on the endotracheal tube significantly reduce intubation&#8208;related complications, such as invasive stimuli, mucosal lesions, laryngeal edema, inflammation, and postoperative pain. This work offers a promising prototype for surface decoration of biomedical devices and holds great prospects for clinical translation to enable interventional operations with minimally invasive impacts.

         <title>Biomimetic Nanoerythrosome&#8208;Coated Aptamer&#8211;DNA Tetrahedron/Maytansine Conjugates: pH&#8208;Responsive and Targeted Cytotoxicity for HER2&#8208;Positive Breast Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PEOz&#8208;erythrosome vesicle loaded with HER2 aptamer&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/maytansine conjugates (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD) is developed for targeted delivery of the HApDCs to HER2&#8208;positive cancer. The PEOz&#8208;erythrosome@HTD prolongs the blood circulation of HTD, protects it from the early blood clearance, and then delivers and releases it into the tumor microenvironment, further improving the antitumor activity of HApDC.








Abstract
DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy to precisely deliver cargos with specific purposes. The short half&#8208;life and low bioavailability of DNA materials due to their interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translation. This study employs an HER2&#8208;targeted DNA&#8208;aptamer&#8208;modified DNA tetrahedron (HApt&#8208;tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combines maytansine (DM1) to develop the HApt&#8208;DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt&#8208;tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) for targeted therapy of HER2&#8208;positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor&#8208;aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage is applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage is constructed by merging the erythrocyte membrane with pH&#8208;responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes, thus with excellent performance of drug delivery and tumor&#8208;stimulated drug release. The hybrid erythrosome&#8208;based nanoparticles show better inhibition of HER2&#8208;positive cancer than other drug formulations and exhibit superior biosafety. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, sensitive tumor probing, and prolonged circulation time, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2&#8208;positive tumors. Notably, this study developsa dual&#8208;targeting nanoparticle by combining pH&#8208;sensitive camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step toward the development and application of DNA&#8208;based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications.

&lt;p&gt;DNA materials have emerged as potential nanocarriers for targeted cancer therapy to precisely deliver cargos with specific purposes. The short half-life and low bioavailability of DNA materials due to their interception by the reticuloendothelial system and blood clearance further limit their clinical translation. This study employs an HER2-targeted DNA-aptamer-modified DNA tetrahedron (HApt-tFNA) as a drug delivery system, and combines maytansine (DM1) to develop the HApt-DNA tetrahedron/DM1 conjugate (HApt-tFNA@DM1, HTD, HApDC) for targeted therapy of HER2-positive cancer. To optimize the pharmacokinetics and tumor-aggregation of HTD, a biomimetic camouflage is applied to embed HTD. The biomimetic camouflage is constructed by merging the erythrocyte membrane with pH-responsive functionalized synthetic liposomes, thus with excellent performance of drug delivery and tumor-stimulated drug release. The hybrid erythrosome-based nanoparticles show better inhibition of HER2-positive cancer than other drug formulations and exhibit superior biosafety. With the strengths of precise delivery, increased drug loading, sensitive tumor probing, and prolonged circulation time, the HApDC represents a promising nanomedicine to treat HER2-positive tumors. Notably, this study developsa dual-targeting nanoparticle by combining pH-sensitive camouflage and HApDC, initiating an important step toward the development and application of DNA-based medicine and biomimetic cell membrane materials in cancer treatment and other potential biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Modulation of the Crosstalk between Schwann Cells and Macrophages for Nerve Regeneration: A Therapeutic Strategy Based on a Multifunctional Tetrahedral Framework Nucleic Acids System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, is reported, which integrates the nerve regenerative potential of microRNA&#8208;22 and tFNAs to enhance the peripheral nerve regeneration by improving the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages. MiDs can rapidly initiate the repair procedures of SCs and facilitate the polarization of macrophages into M2 macrophages to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment.








Abstract
Peripheral nerve injury (PNI) is currently recognized as one of the most significant public health issues and affects the general well&#8208;being of millions of individuals worldwide. Despite advances in nerve tissue engineering, nerve repair still cannot guarantee complete functional recovery. In the present study, an innovative approach is adopted to establish a multifunctional tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) system, denoted as MiDs, which can integrate the powerful programmability, permeability, and structural stability of tFNAs, with the nerve regeneration potential of microRNA&#8208;22 to enhance the communication between Schwann cells (SCs) and macrophages for more effective functional rehabilitation of peripheral nerves. Relevant results demonstrate that MiDs can amplify the ability of SCs to recruit macrophages and facilitate their polarization into the pro&#8208;healing M2 phenotype to reconstruct the post&#8208;injury microenvironment. Furthermore, MiDs can initiate the adaptive intracellular reprogramming of SCs within a short period to further promote axon regeneration and remyelination. MiDs represent a new possibility for enhancing nerve repair and may have critical clinical applications in the future.

Axon Regeneration
In article number 2202513, Sirong Shi, Yungfeng Lin, and co&#8208;workers report a multifunctional tetrahedral&#8208;framework nucleic acids system, denoted as MiDs. The peripheral nervous system is like a vibrant rainforest. As flexible in conformation as cats, the powerful MiDs enhance the role of macrophages (represented by the fireflies) and Schwann cells (butterflies) on damaged peripheral nerves, allowing them to grow freely like newborn vines.

Lamellar Frameworks
In article number 2107941, Runlai Li, Qiang Fu, and co&#8208;workers propose a method to thin down commodity polymers into lamellar thin frameworks (LTF) with a square&#8208;meter large area. Interactions between molecules are regulated by multistep processing for ordered molecular alignment.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lamellar Frameworks&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202107941"&gt;2107941&lt;/a&gt;, Runlai Li, Qiang Fu, and co-workers propose a method to thin down commodity polymers into lamellar thin frameworks (LTF) with a square-meter large area. Interactions between molecules are regulated by multistep processing for ordered molecular alignment. The prepared new structures (LTF and shish-network), properties (ultrahigh transparency and specific stiffness), and measurements may promote fundamental research and novel practical applications of commodity polymers.

         <title>Mechanistically Scoping Cell&#8208;Free and Cell&#8208;Dependent Artificial Scaffolds in Rebuilding Skeletal and Dental Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rebuilding mineralized structures in tooth and bone is always the supreme goal in fields of regenerative dentistry and orthopedics. Mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding skeletal and dental hard tissues are reviewed, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.








Abstract
Rebuilding mineralized tissues in skeletal and dental systems remains costly and challenging. Despite numerous demands and heavy clinical burden over the world, sources of autografts, allografts, and xenografts are far limited, along with massive risks including viral infections, ethic crisis, and so on. Per such dilemma, artificial scaffolds have emerged to provide efficient alternatives. To date, cell&#8208;free biomimetic mineralization (BM) and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have both demonstrated promising capabilities of regenerating mineralized tissues. However, BM and cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds have distinctive mechanisms for mineral genesis, which makes them methodically, synthetically, and functionally disparate. Herein, these two strategies in regenerative dentistry and orthopedics are systematically summarized at the level of mechanisms. For BM, methodological and theoretical advances are focused upon; and meanwhile, for cell&#8208;dependent scaffolds, it is demonstrated how scaffolds orchestrate osteogenic cell fate. The summary of the experimental advances and clinical progress will endow researchers with mechanistic understandings of artificial scaffolds in rebuilding hard tissues, by which better clinical choices and research directions may be approached.

         <title>Multifunctional Biomedical Materials Derived from Biological Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles are reviewed, and selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications are also highlighted. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.








Abstract
The delicate structure and fantastic functions of biological membranes are the successful evolutionary results of a long&#8208;term natural selection process. Their excellent biocompatibility and biofunctionality are widely utilized to construct multifunctional biomedical materials mainly by directly camouflaging materials with single or mixed biological membranes, decorating or incorporating materials with membrane&#8208;derived vesicles&#160;(e.g., exosomes), and designing multifunctional materials with the structure/functions of biological membranes. Here, the structure&#8211;function relationship of some important biological membranes and biomimetic membranes are discussed, such as various cell membranes, extracellular vesicles, and membranes from bacteria and organelles. Selected literature examples of multifunctional biomaterials derived from biological membranes for biomedical applications, such as drug&#8208; and gene&#8208;delivery systems, tissue&#8208;repair scaffolds, bioimaging, biosensors, and biological detection, are also highlighted. These designed materials show excellent properties, such as long circulation time, disease&#8208;targeted therapy, excellent biocompatibility, and selective recognition. Finally, perspectives and challenges associated with the clinical applications of biological&#8208;membrane&#8208;derived materials are discussed.

         <title>Recent Advances in Delivery Systems for Genetic and Other Novel Vaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New vaccines such as genetic and subunit vaccines create the potential for improving the protective for improving challenged diseases. Owing to their nature, vaccine&#8208;delivery systems are important for their development. Recent advances are assessed and their features are discussed based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, providing an overview of this field.








Abstract
Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost&#8208;effective prophylactic measures against diseases, especially infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. However, the development of effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines for other diseases such as cancer remains challenging. This is often due to the imprecise control of vaccine activity in vivo which leads to insufficient/inappropriate immune responses or short immune memory. The development of new vaccine types in recent decades has created the potential for improving the protective potency against these diseases. Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vaccination is one of the most successful and cost-effective prophylactic measures against diseases, especially infectious diseases including smallpox and polio. However, the development of effective prophylactic or therapeutic vaccines for other diseases such as cancer remains challenging. This is often due to the imprecise control of vaccine activity in vivo which leads to insufficient/inappropriate immune responses or short immune memory. The development of new vaccine types in recent decades has created the potential for improving the protective potency against these diseases. Genetic and subunit vaccines are two major categories of these emerging vaccines. Owing to their nature, they rely heavily on delivery systems with various functions, such as effective cargo protection, immunogenicity enhancement, targeted delivery, sustained release of antigens, selective activation of humoral and/or cellular immune responses against specific antigens, and reduced adverse effects. Therefore, vaccine delivery systems may significantly affect the final outcome of genetic and other novel vaccines and are vital for their development. This review introduces these studies based on their research emphasis on functional design or administration route optimization, presents recent progress, and discusses features of new vaccine delivery systems, providing an overview of this field.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Functionalizing Framework Nucleic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Nanostructures for Biomedical Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In addition to promising biocompatibility and biodegradability, tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) possess four key merits, including enhanced endocytosis, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, drug loading alternatives, and preferred biodistribution. These merits afford functionalization of static and dynamic tFNAs, such as oligonucleotide&#8208;modified tFNA, drug&#8208;loaded tFNA, and stimuli&#8208;responsive tFNA, for diverse biological applications in tissue engineering, target therapy, and antibacterial and anticancer treatments.








Abstract
Strategies for functionalizing diverse tetrahedral framework nucleic acids (tFNAs) have been extensively explored since the first successful fabrication of tFNA by Turberfield. One&#8208;pot annealing of at least four DNA single strands is the most common method to prepare tFNA, as it optimizes the cost, yield, and speed of assembly. Herein, the focus is on four key merits of tFNAs and their potential for biomedical applications. The natural ability of tFNA to scavenge reactive oxygen species, along with remarkable enhancement in cellular endocytosis and tissue permeability based on its appropriate size and geometry, promotes cell&#8211;material interactions to direct or probe cell behavior, especially to treat inflammatory and degenerative diseases. Moreover, the structural programmability of tFNA enables the development of static tFNA&#8208;based nanomaterials via engineering of functional oligonucleotides or therapeutic molecules, and dynamic tFNAs via attachment of stimuli&#8208;responsive DNA apparatuses, leading to potential applications in targeted therapies, tissue regeneration, antitumor strategies, and antibacterial treatment. Although there are impressive performance and significant progress, the challenges and prospects of functionalizing tFNA&#8208;based nanostructures are still indicated in this review.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Collagen fibers (CFs), the structural proteins ubiquitously existing in animal skins, feature unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, and versatile reactivity. Owing to the intrinsic merits of CFs, progressive successes have been achieved in developing CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the recent development of CFs&#8208;based separation materials and their future perspectives.








Abstract
Separation plays a critical role in a broad range of industrial applications. Developing advanced separation materials is of great significance for the future development of separation technology. Collagen fibers (CFs), the typical structural proteins, exhibit unique structural hierarchy, amphiphilic wettability, and versatile chemical reactivity. These distinctive properties provide infinite possibilities for the rational design of advanced separation materials. During the past 2 decades, many progressive achievements in the development of CFs&#8208;derived advanced separation materials have been witnessed already. Herein, the CFs&#8208;based separation materials are focused on and the recent progresses in this topic are reviewed. CFs widely existing in animal skins display unique hierarchically fibrous structure, amphiphilicity&#8208;enabled surface wetting behaviors, multi&#8208;functionality guaranteed covalent/non&#8208;covalent reaction versatility. These outstanding merits of CFs bring great opportunities for realizing rational design of a variety of advanced separation materials that were&#160;capable of achieving high&#8208;performance separations to diverse specific targets, including oily pollutants, natural products, metal ions, anionic contaminants and proteins, etc. Besides, the important issues for the further development of CFs&#8208;based advanced separation materials are also discussed.

         <title>Ternary Blend Organic Solar Cells: Understanding the Morphology from Recent Progress</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review briefly introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends and then summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, vertical phase separation, direct observation of the morphology as well as morphological stability.








Abstract
Ternary blend organic solar cells (TB&#8208;OSCs) incorporating multiple donor and/or acceptor materials into the active layer have emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the overall device parameters for realizing higher performances than binary devices. Whereas introducing multiple materials also results in a more complicated morphology than their binary blend counterparts. Understanding the morphology is crucially important for further improving the device performance of TB&#8208;OSC. This review introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends. Then, this review summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, directly observation of morphology, vertical phase separation as well as morphological stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ternary blend organic solar cells (TB-OSCs) incorporating multiple donor and/or acceptor materials into the active layer have emerged as a promising strategy to simultaneously improve the overall device parameters for realizing higher performances than binary devices. Whereas introducing multiple materials also results in a more complicated morphology than their binary blend counterparts. Understanding the morphology is crucially important for further improving the device performance of TB-OSC. This review introduces the solubility and miscibility parameters that affect the morphology of ternary blends. Then, this review summarizes the recent processes of morphology study on ternary blends from the aspects of molecular crystallinity, molecular packing orientation, domain size and purity, directly observation of morphology, vertical phase separation as well as morphological stability. Finally, summary and prospects of TB-OSCs are concluded.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Review on Mechanochemistry: Approaching Advanced Energy Materials with Greener Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochemistry as a powerful tool to prepare advanced energy materials is reviewed, covering specific aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. This review intends to comprehensively clarify mechanism, features, and methods of mechanochemistry and summarize the latest advances and progress in this field to inspire interdisciplinary research for developing novel energy materials with greener mechanical force.








Abstract
Mechanochemistry with solvent&#8208;free and environmentally friendly characteristics is one of the most promising alternatives to traditional liquid&#8208;phase&#8208;based reactions, demonstrating epoch&#8208;making significance in the realization of different types of chemistry. Mechanochemistry utilizes mechanical energy to promote physical and chemical transformations to design complex molecules and nanostructured materials, encourage dispersion and recombination of multiphase components, and accelerate reaction rates and efficiencies via highly reactive surfaces. In particular, mechanochemistry deserves special attention because it is capable of endowing energy materials with unique characteristics and properties. Herein, the latest advances and progress in mechanochemistry for the preparation and modification of energy materials are reviewed. An outline of the basic knowledge, methods, and characteristics of different mechanochemical strategies is presented, distinguishing this review from most mechanochemistry reviews that only focus on ball&#8208;milling. Next, this outline is followed by a detailed and insightful discussion of mechanochemistry&#8208;involved energy conversion and storage applications. The discussion comprehensively covers aspects of energy transformations from mechanical/optical/chemical energy to electrical energy. Finally, next&#8208;generation advanced energy materials are proposed. This review is intended to bring mechanochemistry to the frontline and guide this burgeoning field of interdisciplinary research for developing advanced energy materials with greener mechanical force.

         <title>Advanced Flame&#8208;Retardant Methods for Polymeric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 46, November 17, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flame&#8208;retardant methods for polymeric materials are reviewed with particular focus on advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods developed in recent years. Both the advantages and drawbacks of these methods are discussed, and prospects for the future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods are presented. It is hoped that this review will guide the development of flame&#8208;retardant polymeric materials.








Abstract
Most organic polymeric materials have high flammability, for which the large amounts of smoke, toxic gases, heat, and melt drips produced during their burning cause immeasurable damages to human life and property every year. Despite some desirable results having been achieved by conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, their application is encountering more and more difficulties with the ever&#8208;increasing high flame&#8208;retardant requirements such as high flame&#8208;retardant efficiency, great persistence, low release of heat, smoke, and toxic gases, and more importantly not deteriorating or even enhancing the overall properties of polymers. Under such condition, some advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods have been developed in the past years based on &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; intumescence, nanotechnology, in situ reinforcement, intrinsic char formation, plasma treatment, biomimetic coatings, etc., which have provided potential solutions to the dilemma of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods. This review briefly outlines the development, application, and problems of conventional flame&#8208;retardant methods, including bulk&#8208;additive, bulk&#8208;copolymerization, and surface treatment, and focuses on the raise, development, and potential application of advanced flame&#8208;retardant methods. The future development of flame&#8208;retardant methods is further discussed.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired hydrogels with lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like properties are reported. By engineering the hierarchical structures, synthetic hydrogel materials can be enabled with the lobster&#8208;underbelly&#8208;like combinational properties, including high ballistic resistance, toughness, strength, water content, and superior softness.








Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content, yet superior softness, in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, a simple, yet effective, strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression&#8208;annealing is reported, leading to a hierarchically structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D&#160;lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e., 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e., 85 wt%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, the hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armor&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high&#8208;fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Photothermal Nanozyme&#8208;Based Microneedle Patch against Refractory Bacterial Biofilm Infection via Iron&#8208;Actuated Janus Ion Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal nanozyme&#8208;based microneedle patch FGO@MN is fabricated for eliminating refractory bacterial biofilm infections. FGO@MN disrupts the bacterial biofilm heat&#8208;shock response and induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death in bacterial biofilm. Simultaneously, the suppressed neutrophils in biofilm microenvironment acquire iron nutrition to reactivate antibiofilm immune response. This dual&#8208;modulation of iron metabolism by FGO@MN is referred to as a novel iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy.








Abstract
Owing to high antibiotic resistance and thermotolerance, bacterial biofilm infections (BBIs) are refractory to elimination. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, and bacteria can thus accumulate iron from surrounding cells to maintain biofilm formation and survival. Consequently, iron deficiency in the biofilm microenvironment (BME) leads to the functional failure of innate immune cells. Herein, a novel antibiofilm strategy of iron&#8208;actuated Janus ion therapy (IJIT) is proposed to regulate iron metabolism in both bacterial biofilm and immune cells. A BME&#8208;responsive photothermal microneedle patch (FGO@MN) is synthesized by the growth of Fe3O4&#160;nanoparticles on graphene oxide nanosheets and then encapsulated in methacrylated hyaluronic acid needle tips. The catalytic product of &#183;OH by FGO@MN in BME disrupts the bacterial heat&#8208;shock proteins, coercing biofilm thermal sensitization. As synergistic mild photothermal treatment triggers iron uptake, the intracellular iron overload further induces ferroptosis&#8208;like death. Moreover, iron&#8208;nourished neutrophils around BME can be rejuvenated for reactivating the suppressed antibiofilm function. Thus, more than 95% BBIs elimination can be achieved by combining heat stress&#8208;triggered iron interference with iron&#8208;nutrient immune reactivation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments validate the scavenging of refractory BBI after 15&#160;days, suggesting the promising perspective of IJIT in future clinical application.

Simultaneously, the suppressed neutrophils in biofilm microenvironment acquire iron nutrition to reactivate antibiofilm immune response. This dual-modulation of iron metabolism by FGO@MN is referred to as a novel iron-actuated Janus ion therapy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to high antibiotic resistance and thermotolerance, bacterial biofilm infections (BBIs) are refractory to elimination. Iron is essential for bacterial growth and metabolism, and bacteria can thus accumulate iron from surrounding cells to maintain biofilm formation and survival. Consequently, iron deficiency in the biofilm microenvironment (BME) leads to the functional failure of innate immune cells. Herein, a novel antibiofilm strategy of iron-actuated Janus ion therapy (IJIT) is proposed to regulate iron metabolism in both bacterial biofilm and immune cells. A BME-responsive photothermal microneedle patch (FGO@MN) is synthesized by the growth of Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;nanoparticles on graphene oxide nanosheets and then encapsulated in methacrylated hyaluronic acid needle tips. The catalytic product of &#183;OH by FGO@MN in BME disrupts the bacterial heat-shock proteins, coercing biofilm thermal sensitization. As synergistic mild photothermal treatment triggers iron uptake, the intracellular iron overload further induces ferroptosis-like death. Moreover, iron-nourished neutrophils around BME can be rejuvenated for reactivating the suppressed antibiofilm function. Thus, more than 95% BBIs elimination can be achieved by combining heat stress-triggered iron interference with iron-nutrient immune reactivation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments validate the scavenging of refractory BBI after 15&#160;days, suggesting the promising perspective of IJIT in future clinical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Desolvation Synergy of Multiple H/Li&#8208;Bonds on an Iron&#8208;Dextran&#8208;Based Catalyst Stimulates Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Cascade Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficient VC@INFeD catalyst is developed for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, accomplishing fast de&#8208;solvation and enrichment of high&#8208;concentration lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) by multiple H/Li&#8208;bonds and resolving subsequent sulfur transformations through cascade catalytic sites where INFeD and VC promote the conversions of long&#8208;chain and short&#8208;chain LiPSs, respectively, which substantially reduce energy barriers and eliminate LiPS shuttling effects.








Abstract
Traditional lithium&#8211;sulfur battery catalysts are still facing substantial challenges in solving sulfur redox reactions, which involve multistep electron transfer and multiphase transformations. Here, inspired by the combination of iron dextran (INFeD) and ascorbic acid (VC) as a blood tonic for the treatment of anemia, a highly efficient VC@INFeD catalyst is developed in the sulfur cathode, accomplishing the desolvation and enrichment of high&#8208;concentration solvated lithium polysulfides at the cathode/electrolyte interface with the assistance of multiple H/Li&#8208;bonds and resolving subsequent sulfur transformations through gradient catalysis sites where the INFeD promotes long&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions and VC accelerates short&#8208;chain lithium polysulfide conversions. Comprehensive characterizations reveal that the VC@INFeD can substantially reduce the energy barrier of each sulfur redox step, inhibit shuttle effects, and endow the lithium&#8211;sulfur battery with high sulfur utilization and superior cycling stability even under a high sulfur loading (5.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) and lean electrolyte (electrolyte/sulfur ratio, &#8776;7&#160;&#181;L mg&#8722;1) condition.

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are two&#8208;dimensional, and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, we present a kirigami strategy to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformally wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. Our kirigami ADM could provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

         <title>Looking Beyond 0 and 1: Principles and Technology of Multi&#8208;Valued Logic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) is an effective means of increasing the bit density and reducing the power consumptions of modern chips. A comprehensive review and classification of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art compact MVL unit devices is presented. Special emphasis is placed on a comparative discussion of advantages and limitations of each class of MVL devices.








Abstract
Ever since the invention of solid&#8208;state transistors, binary devices have dominated the electronics industry. Although the binary technology links the natural property of devices to be in the ON or OFF state with two logic levels, it provides the least possible information content per interconnect. Multi&#8208;valued logic (MVL) has long been considered as a means of improving the computation efficiency and reducing the power consumption of modern chips. In view of the power density limits of the conventional complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology, MVL technologies have recently gained even more attention, and various MVL unit devices based on conventional and emerging materials have been proposed. Herein, the recent&#160;achievements toward the development of compact MVL unit devices are reviewed. First, basic principles of MVL technologies are introduced by describing methods of obtaining multiple logic states and discussing radix&#8208;related aspects of MVL computation. Next, MVL unit devices are classified and overviewed with emphasis on principles of operation, technologies, and applications. Finally, a&#160;comparative discussion of strengths and weaknesses is provided for each class of MVL devices, and the review concludes with the outlook for the MVL field.

         <title>Entropy stabilization strategy for enhancing the local structural adaptability of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with high reversible energy densities are becoming prevalent. However, owing to the activation of low&#8208;potential redox couples and the progressively irreversible structural transformation caused by the local adjustment of transition&#8208;metal ions in the intra/interlayer driven by anionic redox, continuous capacity degradation and voltage decay emerge, thus greatly reducing the energy density and increasing the difficulty of battery system management. Herein, layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability with no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. Consequently, the energy retention of the entropy&#8208;stabilization&#8208;strategy&#8208;enhanced Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is almost twice that of a typical Li&#8208;rich cathode material (Li1.20Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, T&#8208;LRM) after 3 months of cyclic testing. Moreover, when cycled at 1C, the voltage degradation per cycle is less than 0.02%, i.e., it results in a voltage loss of only 0.8&#160;mV per cycle, which is excellent performance. This study paves the way for the development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with stabilized intralayer atomic arrangements and high local structural adaptability.

         <title>A highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatments using repeated debridement and long&#8208;term antibiotic administration impose a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, we describe a highly efficacious electrical anti&#8208;biofilm system in this paper. Our system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery and penetration into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, our system uses short treatments (&#8804; 2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of MRSA biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from over 1010 CFU g&#8722;1 to 105.2 CFU g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, our system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo anti&#8208;biofilm efficacy of our system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 CFU g&#8722;1 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1&#8208;day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 g&#8722;1 at 7&#8208;day post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, our novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infection and will facilitate wound healing process.

MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 10&lt;sup&gt;9.0&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;4.6&lt;/sup&gt; CFU g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1-day post-treatment and to 10&lt;sup&gt;3.3&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 7-day post-treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, our novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infection and will facilitate wound healing process.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Functionalized Germananes: Synthesis and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the realm of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) layered materials, the monoelemental group 14 Xene, germanene, as the germanium analog of graphene, has emerged as the next prospective candidate. Preceded by silicon, germanium is widely used in the semiconductor industry; thus, germanene is deemed compatible with existing semiconductor technologies. Germanene consists of mixed sp2&#8722;sp3&#8208;hybridized networks in a buckled hexagonal honeycomb structure. Chemical exfoliation of Zintl phases, such as CaGe2, specifically the topotactical deintercalation in acidic media, removes the alkaline earth metal ions Ca2+, giving rise to layered germanane (germanene with the Ge centers covalently saturated with terminal hydrogen atoms). Diverse variants of functionalized germananes (with covalent group(s) termination) can be obtained by varying the topotactical deintercalation precursors, elevating the game with limitless functionalization possibilities for customizable properties or new functionalities. We comprehensively cover the preparation of Zintl phases to the details of functionalized and modified germananes and their properties, and the additional exfoliation step to achieve mono&#8208; or few&#8208;layer germananes. We review the progress and challenges of 2D functionalized germananes in optoelectronics, catalysis, energy conversion and storage, sensors, and biomedical areas. This review provides insight into designing and exploring this class of atomically thin semiconductors in realizing future nanoarchitectonics.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;thermomechanically reprogrammable mechanical metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Future active metamaterials for reconfigurable structural applications require fast, untethered, reversible, and reprogrammable (multimodal) transformability with shape locking. Magnetic control has a superior advantage for fast and remotely controlled deployment; however, a significant drawback is a need to maintain the magnetic force to hold the transformation, limiting its use in structural applications. The shape&#8208;locking property of shape memory polymers (SMPs) can resolve this issue. However, the intrinsic irreversibility of SMPs may limit their reconfigurability as active metamaterials. Moreover, to date, reprogrammable methods have required high power with laser and arc welding, proving to be energy&#8208;inefficient control methods. Herein, we aim to construct and demonstrate a magneto&#8208;thermomechanical tool that enables a single material system to transform with untethered, reversible, low&#8208;powered reprogrammable deformations and shape locking via the application of magneto&#8208;thermomechanically triggered prestress on the SMP and structural instability with asymmetric magnetic torque. We demonstrate the mutual assistance of two physics concepts &#8212; magnetic control combined with the thermomechanical behavior of shape memory polymers, without requiring new materials synthesis and high&#8208;power energy for reprogramming. Our approach can open a new path of active metamaterials, flexible yet stiff soft robots, multimodal morphing structures, and mechanical computing devices where we can design them in reversible and reprogrammable ways.

         <title>Tethered Small&#8208;Molecule Acceptors Simultaneously Enhances the Efficiency and Stability of Polymer Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have seen rapid progress in recent years, whereby the mixture of polymer donors and small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) are fine&#8208;tuned to realize a favorable kinetically trapped morphology and thus a commercially viable device efficiency. However, the thermodynamic relaxation of the mixed domains within the blend raises concerns related to the long&#8208;term operational stability of the devices, especially in the record&#8208;holding A&#8208;DA'D&#8208;A type SMAs (typically identified as Y6). In addressing this challenge, we report a new class of dimeric Y6&#8208;based SMAs tethered with differential flexible spacers to regulate their aggregation and relaxation behavior. In their polymer blends with PM6, we find that they favor an improved structural order relative to that of Y6 counterpart as evidenced by their shorter facial &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking distance and larger crystal coherence length, leading to higher and more balanced charge transport in device. Most importantly, with flexible spacers to restrict the motion of individual SMAs, the tethered SMAs show large glass transition temperatures to suppress the thermodynamic relaxation in mixed domains, which is also evidenced by the larger Flory&#8211;Huggins interaction parameter with the polymer donor. For the high performing dimeric blend, an unprecedented open circuit voltage of 0.87&#160;V is realized with a conversion efficiency of 17.85%, while those of regular Y6&#8208;base devices only reach 0.84&#160;V and 16.9%, respectively. Most importantly, the dimer&#8208;based device possess substantially reduced burn&#8208;in efficiency loss, retaining more than 80% of the initial efficiency after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 700 hours. Our tethering approach provides a new direction to develop PSCs with high efficiency and excellent operating stability.

         <title>Low&#8208;Voltage Intrinsically Stretchable Organic Transistor Amplifiers for Ultrasensitive Electrophysiological Signal Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchability is a prerequisite for electronic skin devices. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art stretchable thin&#8208;film transistors do not possess sufficiently low operating voltages and good stability, significantly limiting their use in real&#8208;world biomedical applications. Herein, a van der Waals&#8208;controlling elastomer/carbon quantum dot interfacial polarization methodology is proposed to form a hybrid polymer dielectric with 620% tensile strain and large&#8208;area film uniformity (&gt; A4 paper size). Using the hybrid polymer dielectrics, the prepared intrinsically stretchable organic thin&#8208;film transistors demonstrate a low operating voltage below 5&#160;V, 100% strain tolerance and excellent operational stability, as well as a high on&#8208;current/off&#8208;current ratio of 105 and a steep subthreshold slope of 500&#160;mV dec&#8722;1. Based on this device technology, an amplifier with a high gain of 90&#160;V/V among the highest values of reported stretchable transistors is realized. This amplifier is at the first time applied to detect human electrophysical signals with an output signal amplitude of over 0.2&#160;V, which even outperforms other types of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art organic amplifiers for human electrophysiology monitoring. This stretchable device technology sufficiently meets the safety and portability requirements of wearable biomedical applications, opening a new opportunity to e&#8208;skin with signal control and amplification capabilities.

         <title>Visualization of Tunable Weyl Line in A&#8208;A Stacking Kagome Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Kagome magnets provide a fascinating platform for a plethora of topological quantum phenomena, in which the delicate interplay between frustrated crystal structure, magnetization and spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) can engender highly tunable topological states. Here, utilizing angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we directly visualize the Weyl lines with strong out&#8208;of&#8208;plane dispersion in the A&#8208;A stacked kagome magnet GdMn6Sn6. Remarkably, the Weyl lines exhibit a strong magnetization&#8208;direction tunable SOC gap and binding energy tunability after substituting Gd with Tb and Li, respectively. Our results not only illustrate the magnetization direction and valence counting as efficient tuning knobs for realizing and controlling distinct three&#8208;dimensional topological phases, but also demonstrate AMn6Sn6 (A = rare earth or Li, Mg, Ca) as a versatile material family for exploring diverse emergent topological quantum responses.

         <title>Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;syngas Evolution with Molecular Catalyst Metal&#8208;organic Framework Nanozymes</title>

Abstract
Syngas, a mixture of CO and H2, is a high&#8208;priority intermediate for producing several commodity chemicals, e.g., ammonia, methanol, and synthetic hydrocarbon fuels. Accordingly, parallel sunlight&#8208;driven catalytic conversion of CO2 and protons to syngas is a key step toward a sustainable energy cycle. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalytic systems and materials often fall short as application&#8208;oriented concurrent CO and H2 evolution requires challenging reaction conditions which can hamper stability, selectivity, and efficiency. Here a light&#8208;harvesting metal&#8208;organic framework hosting two molecular catalysts is engineered to yield colloidal, water&#8208;stable, versatile nanoreactors for photocatalytic syngas generation with highly controllable product ratios. In&#8208;depth fluorescence, X&#8208;ray, and microscopic studies paired with kinetic analysis showed that the host delivers energy efficiently to active sites, conceptually yielding nanozymes. This unlocked sustained CO2 reduction and H2 evolution with benchmark turnover numbers and record incident photon conversions up to 36%, showcasing a highly active and durable all&#8208;in&#8208;one material toward application in solar energy&#8208;driven syngas generation.

         <title>Mechanical Janus Structures by Soft&#8208;Hard Material Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Engineering Janus structures that possess anisotropic features in functions have attracted growing attention for a wide range of applications in sensors, catalysis, and biomedicine, and are yet usually designed at the nanoscale with distinct physical or chemical functionalities in their opposite sides. Inspired by the seamless integration of soft and hard materials in biological structures, here we present a mechanical Janus structure composed of soft and hard materials with a dramatic difference of mechanical properties at additively manufacturable macroscale. We establish, in the combination of extensive experimental, theoretical, and computational studies, the design principle of soft&#8208;hard materials integrated mechanical Janus structures and address their unique rotation mechanism. We further show the systematic studies of assembling the Janus structure units into superstructures with well&#8208;ordered organizations by programing their local rotations, providing a direct route of designing superstructures by leveraging mechanical Janus structures with unique soft&#8208;hard material integration. Applications are conducted to demonstrate the features and functionalities of assembled superstructures with local ordered organizations in regulating and filtering acoustic wave propagations, thereby providing exemplification applications of mechanical Janus design in functional structures and devices.

         <title>Unusual Spectrally Reproducible and High Q&#8208;Factor Random Lasing in Polycrystalline Tin Perovskite Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An unusual spectrally reproducible near&#8208;IR random lasing (RL) with no fluctuation of lasing peak wavelength is disclosed in polycrystalline films of FASnI3 perovskite, which have been chemically stabilized against Sn2+ to Sn4+ oxidation. Remarkably, a quality Q&#8208;factor as high as &#8776;104 with an amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) threshold as low as 2 &#956;J/cm2 (both at 20 K) are achieved. However, RL is also observed at room temperature with a decrease of Q relative low temperature in just one order. Additionally, the specific conditions in which only narrow RL lines are generated have been also found, while the formation of the ASE contour is strongly suppressed. The observed spectral reproducibility is unprecedented for semiconductor thin film RL systems and cannot be explained by the strong spatial localization of lasing modes. Instead, we suggest that the spectral stability is a result of such a unique property of Sn&#8208;based perovskites as a large inhomogeneous broadening of the emitting centers, which is a consequence of an intrinsic structural inhomogeneity of the material. Due to this, lasing can occur simultaneously in modes that are spatially strongly overlapped, as long as the spectral separation between the modes is larger than the homogeneous linewidth of the emitting centers. The discovered mechanism of RL spectral stability in semiconductor materials, possessing inhomogeneous broadening, opens up prospects for their practical use as cheap sources of narrow laser lines.

         <title>Strategic Synthesis of 2D&#8208;, 3D&#8208;Conducting Polymers and derived Nanocomposites</title>

Abstract
In recent decades, there has been a great deal of interest in conducting polymers due to their broad applications. At the same time, various synthetic techniques have been developed to produce various nanostructures of the conducting polymers with their fascinating properties. However, the techniques for the manufacture of 2D nanosheets are either complex or expensive. No comprehensive approach for constructing two&#8208;dimensional and three&#8208;dimensional materials or their composites has been documented. Herein, a simple and scalable synthetic protocol is reported for the design of two&#8208;dimensional (2D&#8208;), three&#8208;dimensional (3D&#8208;), and related conducting polymer nanocomposites by interface manipulation in a bicontinuous microemulsion system. In this method, diverse bicontinuous thin layers of oil and water are employed to produce two&#8208;dimensional nanosheets of conducting polymers. For the fabrication of 3D&#8208;PPY and their composites, special designed linkers of the monomers were applied to lock 3D&#8208;networks of conducting polymers and their composites. The technique can be extended to fabrication of most conducting polymer composites, being cost&#8208;effective and easily scalable. Optimum electrical conductivity obtained for 2D&#8208;PPY nanosheets were 219 Scm&#8722;1, the highest literature value reported to date to the best of our knowledge.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Doped heavy metal&#8208;free III &#8211; V semiconductor nanocrystal quantum dots are of great interest both from the fundamental aspects of doping in highly confined structures, and from the applicative side of utilizing such building blocks in the fabrication of p&#8208;n homojunction devices. InAs nanocrystals, that are of particular relevance for short wave IR detection and emission applications, manifest heavy n&#8208;type character poising a challenge for their transition to p&#8208;type behavior. We present p&#8208;type doping of InAs nanocrystals with Zn &#8211; enabling control over the charge carrier type in InAs QDs field effect transistors. The post&#8208;synthesis doping reaction mechanism is studied for Zn precursors with varying reactivity. Successful p&#8208;type doping was achieved by the more reactive precursor, diethylzinc. Substitutional doping by Zn2+ replacing In3+ is established by X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy analysis. Furthermore, enhanced near IR photoluminescence is observed due to surface passivation by Zn as indicated from elemental mapping utilizing high resolution electron microscopy corroborated by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy study. The demonstrated ability to control the carrier type, along with the improved emission characteristics, paves the way towards fabrication of optoelectronic devices active in the short wave IR region utilizing heavy&#8208;metal free nanocrystal building blocks.

         <title>Reservoir Computing with Charge&#8208;Trap Memory Based on a MoS2 Channel for Neuromorphic Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a&#160;charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) based on MoS2 where the memory operation arises thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. The CTM device displays synaptic potentiation/depression induced by pulses applied to the gate or drain terminal with excellent linearity. The synaptic characteristics are used in a reservoir computing system for visual pattern recognition, which makes MoS2&#8208;based CT emerge as one of the most promising technologies&#160;for neuromorphic engineering.








Abstract
Novel memory devices are essential for developing low power, fast, and accurate in&#8208;memory computing and neuromorphic engineering concepts that can compete with the conventional complementary metal&#8722;oxide&#8722;semiconductor (CMOS) digital processors. 2D semiconductors provide a novel platform for advanced semiconductors with atomic thickness, low&#8208;current operation, and capability of 3D integration. This work presents a charge&#8208;trap memory (CTM) device with a MoS2 channel where memory operation arises, thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. Transistor operation, memory characteristics, and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications are demonstrated. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. Finally, pattern recognition is demonstrated by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS2&#8208;based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation, and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high&#8208;density neuromorphic computing concepts.

This work presents a charge-trap memory (CTM) device with a MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel where memory operation arises, thanks to electron trapping/detrapping at interface states. Transistor operation, memory characteristics, and synaptic potentiation/depression for neuromorphic applications are demonstrated. The CTM device shows outstanding linearity of the potentiation by applied drain pulses of equal amplitude. Finally, pattern recognition is demonstrated by reservoir computing where the input pattern is applied as a stimulation of the MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based CTMs, while the output current after stimulation is processed by a feedforward readout network. The good accuracy, the low current operation, and the robustness to input random bit flip makes the CTM device a promising technology for future high-density neuromorphic computing concepts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spider&#8208;Silk&#8208;Inspired Nanocomposite Polymers for Durable Daytime Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The issue of durability related to mechanical and UV properties of radiative cooling materials needs to be addressed for practical applications. A spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired design of nanocomposite polymers with K2Ti6O13 nanofiber dopants for enhancing the durability without compromising their cooling performance is proposed. This work provides a general strategy to enhance the durability of polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials&#160;toward large&#8208;scale applications.








Abstract
Passive daytime radiative cooling (PDRC) materials, that strongly reflect sunlight and emit thermal radiation to outer space, demonstrate great potential in energy&#8208;saving for sustainable development. Particularly, polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials, with advantages of easy&#8208;processing, low cost, and outstanding cooling performance, have attracted intense attention. However, just like other polymer devices (for example polymer solar cells) working under sunlight, the issue of durability related to mechanical and UV properties needs to be addressed for large&#8208;scale practical applications. Here, a spider&#8208;silk&#8208;inspired design of nanocomposite polymers with potassium titanate (K2Ti6O13) nanofiber dopants is proposed for enhancing the durability without compromising their cooling performance. The formed tough interface of nanofiber/polymer effectively disperses stress, enhancing the mechanical properties of the polymer matrix; while the K2Ti6O13 can absorb high&#8208;energy UV photons and transform them into less harmful heat, thereby improving the UV stabilities. Taking poly(ethylene oxide) radiative cooler as an example for demonstration, its Young's modulus and UV resistance increase by 7 and 12 times, respectively. Consequently, the solar reflectance of nanocomposite poly(ethylene oxide) is maintained as constant in a&#160;continuous aging test for 720&#160;h under outdoor sunlight. The work provides a general strategy to simultaneously enhance both the mechanical stability and the UV durability of polymer&#8208;based PDRC materials&#160;toward large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Rate and Selective CO2 Electrolysis to Ethylene via Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Augmented CO2 Availability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient electrochemical carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added chemicals requires gas diffusion electrode (GDE)&#8208;based electrolyzers. For high&#8208;rate ethylene (C2H4) production with *CO dimerization, a microenvironment with high CO2 availability near the active sites is essential. Metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;induced organic layers in the GDE enable augmentation of the local CO2 concentration and promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction at high current densities.








Abstract
High&#8208;rate conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) to ethylene (C2H4) in the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) requires fine control over the phase boundary of the gas diffusion electrode (GDE) to overcome the limit of CO2 solubility in aqueous electrolytes. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;functionalized GDE design is presented, based on a catalysts:MOFs:hydrophobic substrate materials layered architecture, that leads to high&#8208;rate and selective C2H4 production in flow cells and membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzers. It is found that using electroanalysis and operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), MOF&#8208;induced organic layers in GDEs augment the local CO2 concentration near the active sites of the Cu catalysts. MOFs with different CO2 adsorption abilities are used, and the stacking ordering of MOFs in the GDE is varied. While sputtering Cu on poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) (Cu/PTFE) exhibits 43% C2H4 Faradaic efficiency (FE) at a current density of 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell, 49% C2H4 FE at 1 A cm&#8722;2 is achieved on MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs in CO2RR. MOF&#8208;augmented GDEs are further evaluated in an MEA electrolyzer, achieving a C2H4 partial current density of 220&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2RR and 121&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for the carbon monoxide reduction reaction (CORR), representing 2.7&#8208;fold and 15&#8208;fold improvement in C2H4 production rate, compared to those obtained on bare Cu/PTFE.

         <title>High Entropy Approach to Engineer Strongly&#8208;Correlated Functionalities in Manganites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Technologically relevant strongly&#8208;correlated phenomena, such as colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) and metal&#8208;insulator transitions (MIT), exhibited by perovskite manganites are driven and enhanced by the coexistence of multiple competing magneto&#8208;electronic phases. Such magneto&#8208;electronic inhomogeneity is governed by the intrinsic lattice&#8208;charge&#8208;spin&#8208;orbital correlations, which, in turn, are conventionally tailored in manganites via chemical substitution, charge doping or strain engineering. Alternately, the recently discovered high entropy oxides (HEOs), owing to the presence of multiple&#8208;principal cations on a given sub&#8208;lattice, exhibit indications of an inherent magneto&#8208;electronic phase separation encapsulated in a single crystallographic phase. Here, we unite the high entropy (HE) concept with standard property control by hole doping in a series of single&#8208;phase orthorhombic HE&#8208;manganites (HE&#8208;Mn), (Gd0.25La0.25Nd0.25Sm0.25)1&#8208;xSrxMnO3 (x = 0 &#8211; 0.5). High&#8208;resolution transmission microscopy reveals hitherto&#8208;unknown lattice imperfections in HEOs: twins, stacking faults and missing planes. Magnetometry and electronic measurements infer three distinct ground states &#8211;insulating&#8208;antiferromagnetic, unpercolated&#8208;metallic&#8208;ferromagnetic and long&#8208;range metallic&#8208;ferromagnetic&#8211; coexisting or/and competing as a result of hole doping and multi&#8208;cation complexity. Consequently, CMR &#8776; 1550% stemming from an MIT is observed in polycrystalline pellets, matching the best&#8208;known values for bulk conventional manganites. Hence, this initial case study highlights the potential for a synergetic development of strongly&#8208;correlated oxides offered by the high entropy design approach.

         <title>Enabling Durable Ultralow&#8208;k capacitors with Enhanced Breakdown Strength in Density&#8208;Variant Nanolattices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultralow&#8208;k materials used in high voltage devices require mechanical resilience and electrical and dielectric stability even when subjected to mechanical loads. Existing devices with organic polymers suffer from low thermal and mechanical stability while those with inorganic porous structures struggle with poor mechanical integrity. Recently, three&#8208;dimensional hollow&#8208;beam nanolattices have emerged as promising candidates that satisfy these requirements. However, their properties are maintained for only five stress cycles at strains below 25%. Here, we demonstrate that alumina nanolattices with different relative density distributions across their height elicit a deterministic mechanical response concomitant with a 1.5&#8764;3.3 times higher electrical breakdown strength than nanolattices with uniform density. These density&#8208;variant nanolattices exhibit an ultralow&#8208;k&#160;of &#8764; 1.2, accompanied by complete electric and dielectric stability and mechanical recoverability over 100 cyclic compressions to 62.5% strain. We explain the enhanced insulation and long&#8208;term cyclical stability by the bi&#8208;phase deformation where the lower&#8208;density region protects the higher&#8208;density region as it is compresses before the higher&#8208;density region, allowing to simultaneously possess high strength and ductility like composites. This study highlights the superior electrical performance of the bi&#8208;phase nanolattice with a single interface in providing stable conduction and maximum breakdown strength.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current PbS colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) solar cell. Here, we perform synergistic passivation in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest PLQY of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#3934;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and PCE of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. Our work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>New Method for Preparing ZnO Layer for Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Owing to outstanding optoelectronic properties and simple preparation, zinc oxide (ZnO) has widely been used in organic solar cells (OSCs). Although versatile cathode interface materials have been designed in past, ZnO remains indispensable owing to its excellent overall performance. Therefore, solving the persistent problem of residual amine reacting with non&#8208;fullerene acceptors will make ZnO superior over other materials, and thus improve the performance and energy budget of OSCs. Herein, we report a simple, effective, and economical method for removing residual amine in ZnO without distorting ZnO. By accurately comparing the alkalinities of ZnO and residual amine, boric acid (BA) was selected as the amine&#8208;removing agent because of its suitable acidic dissociation constant. Moreover, the high water solubility of BA ensures that the post&#8208;cleaning process can be easily performed. The work function, electron extraction, and stability of cathode interface layer were optimized through rising them with BA. Consequently, the power conversion efficiency and stability of OSCs under long&#8208;term illumination were significantly improved. The optimal 0.04 and 1.00 cm2 single&#8208;junction OSCs based on PBDB&#8208;TF:HDO&#8208;4Cl:BTP&#8208;eC9 bulk heterojunction output 18.40% and 17.42% efficiencies, respectively. Furthermore, tandem OSCs based on the BA&#8208;treated ZnO exhibited a 19.56% power conversion efficiency, demonstrating the reliability of this method.

         <title>Delicate Co&#8208;Control of Shell Structure and Sulfur Vacancies in Interlayer&#8208;Expanded Tungsten Disulfide Hollow Sphere for Fast and Stable Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hollow multishelled structure (HoMS) is a promising multi&#8208;functional platform for energy storage, owing to its unique temporal&#8208;spatial ordering property and buffering function. Accurate co&#8208;control of its multiscale structures might bring fascinating properties and new opportunities, which is highly desired yet rarely achieved due to the challenging synthesis. Herein, a sequential sulfidation and etching approach is developed to achieve the delicate co&#8208;control over both molecular&#8208; and nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;scale structure of WS2&#8208;x HoMS. Typically, sextuple&#8208;shelled WS2&#8208;x HoMS with abundant sulfur vacancies and expanded&#8208;interlayer spacing is obtained from triple&#8208;shelled WO3 HoMS. By further coating with nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon, WS2&#8208;x HoMS maintains a reversible capacity of 241.7 mAh/g at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles for sodium storage, which is superior to the previously reported results. Mechanism analyses reveal that HoMS provides good electrode&#8208;electrolyte contact and plentiful sodium storage sites as well as an effective buffer of the stress/strain during cycling; sulfur vacancy and expanded interlayer of WS2&#8208;x enhance ion diffusion kinetics; carbon coating improves the electron conductivity and benefits the structural stability. This finding offers prospects for realizing practical fast&#8208;charging, high&#8208;energy, and long&#8208;cycling sodium storage.

         <title>Accelerating Electron&#8208;Transfer Dynamics by TiO2&#8208;Immobilized Reversible Single&#8208;Atom Copper for Enhanced Artificial Photosynthesis of Urea</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper is proposed for enhancing artificial urea photosynthesis using N2 and CO2 in pure H2O. The quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations reveal that the accelerated electron&#8208;transfer dynamics can be attributed to the reversibility of single&#8208;atom Cu for ensuring multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demand and supply of urea photosynthesis, thereby yielding as high as 432.12&#160;&#181;g gcat.&#8722;1 of urea.








Abstract
Photocatalysis as a sustainable technology is expected to provide a novel sight for the green synthesis of urea directly using N2, CO2, and H2O under mild conditions. However, the fundamental issue of inefficient electron transfer in photocatalysis strongly hinders its feasibility, especially for the above multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding urea synthesis. Herein, an effective strategy of accelerating electron&#8208;transfer dynamics is reported by TiO2&#8208;immobilized reversible single&#8208;atom copper (denoted as Cu SA&#8208;TiO2) to enhance the performance for photosynthesis of urea from N2, CO2, and H2O. As revealed by a series of quasi&#8208;in&#8208;situ characterizations (e.g., electron paramagnetic resonance, and wavelength&#8208;resolved and femtosecond time&#8208;resolved spectroscopies), the expedited dynamics behaviors originating from reversible single&#8208;atom copper in as&#8208;designed Cu SA&#8208;TiO2 (electron extraction rate: over 30 times faster than the reference photocatalysts) allow the assurance of abundant and continual photogenerated electrons for multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding co&#8208;photoactivation of N2 and CO2, resulting in considerable rates of urea production. The strategy above for improving the photoelectron&#8208;extraction ability of photocatalysts will offer a high&#8208;efficiency and promising route for artificial urea photosynthesis and other multi&#8208;electron&#8208;demanding photocatalytic reactions.

         <title>Room temperature gate&#8208;tunable non&#8208;reciprocal charge transport in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe heterostructures</title>

Abstract
Symmetry manipulation can be used to effectively tailor the physical order in solid&#8208;state systems. With the breaking of both the inversion and time&#8208;reversal symmetries, non&#8208;reciprocal magneto&#8208;transport may arise in nonmagnetic systems to enrich spin&#8208;orbit effects. This study investigated the observation of unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) in lattice&#8208;matched InSb/CdTe films up to room temperature. Benefiting from the strong built&#8208;in electric field of 0.13 V&#8901;nm&#8722;1 in the heterojunction region, the resulting Rashba&#8208;type spin&#8208;orbit coupling and quantum confinement resulted in a distinct sinusoidal UMR signal with a non&#8208;reciprocal coefficient that was 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude larger than most non&#8208;centrosymmetric materials at 298 K. Moreover, this heterostructure configuration enabled highly efficient gate tuning of the rectification response, wherein the UMR amplitude was enhanced by 40%. The results of this study advocate the use of narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor&#8208;based hybrid systems with robust spin textures as suitable platforms for the pursuit of controllable chiral spin&#8208;orbit applications.

         <title>Memristive Field&#8208;Programmable Analog Arrays for Analog Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The increasing interests in analog computing nowadays call for multi&#8208;purpose analog computing platforms with reconfigurability. The advancement of analog computing, enabled by novel electronic elements like memristors, has shown its potential to sustain the exponential growth of computing demand in the new era of analog data deluge. Here, we experimentally demonstrate a platform of a memristive field&#8208;programmable analog array (memFPAA) with memristive devices serving as a variety of core analog elements and CMOS components as peripheral circuits. We reconfigure the memFPAA and implement a first&#8208;order band pass filter, an audio equalizer, and an acoustic mixed frequency classifier, as application examples. The memFPAA, featured with programmable analog memristors, memristive routing networks, and memristive vector&#8208;matrix multipliers, opens opportunities for fast prototyping analog designs as well as efficient analog applications in signal processing and neuromorphic computing.

         <title>A Monolithic Graphene&#8208;Functionalized Microlaser for Multispecies Gas Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of 2D materials and optical microcavities offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques. In this work, graphene&#8208;enabled splitting modes in a monolithic microsphere laser are used to obtain multispecies gas detection (CO2, NH3, NO2,&#160;and H2O) with extremely high sensitivity down to individual molecules.








Abstract
Optical&#8208;microcavity&#8208;enhanced light&#8211;matter interaction offers a powerful tool to develop fast and precise sensing techniques, spurring applications in the detection of biochemical targets ranging from cells, nanoparticles, and large molecules. However, the intrinsic inertness of such pristine microresonators limits their spread in new fields such as gas detection. Here, a functionalized microlaser sensor is realized by depositing graphene in an erbium&#8208;doped over&#8208;modal microsphere. By using a 980&#160;nm pump, multiple laser lines excited in different mode families of the microresonator are co&#8208;generated in a single device. The interference between these splitting mode lasers produce beat notes in the electrical domain (0.2&#8211;1.1&#160;MHz) with sub&#8208;kHz accuracy, thanks to the graphene&#8208;induced intracavity backward scattering. This allows for lab&#8208;free multispecies gas identification from a mixture, and ultrasensitive gas detection down to individual molecule.

         <title>Ferritin&#8208;Hijacking Nanoparticles Spatiotemporally Directing Endogenous Ferroptosis for Synergistic Anticancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6), which can induce ferroptosis through activation of endogenous iron. This strategy highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.








Abstract
Existing ferroptosis as an iron&#8208;dependent form of regulated cell death primarily relies on importing exogenous iron. However, the excessive employment of toxic materials may cause potential adverse effects on human health. Herein, a ferritin&#8208;hijacking nanoparticle (Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15) is fabricated, by conjugating the ferritin&#8208;homing peptide HKN15 with the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) for endogenous ferroptosis without introducing Fenton&#8208;reactive metals. Once internalized, the designed Ce6&#8208;PEG&#8208;HKN15 NPs can specifically accumulate around ferritin. With laser irradiation, the activated Ce6 in nanoparticles potently generates reactive oxygen species (ROS) surrounding ferritin. Abundant ROS not only helps&#160;to destroy the iron storage protein and activate endogenous ferroptosis but also directly kill tumor cells. In turn, the released iron partially interacts with intracellular excess H2O2 to produce O2, thereby enhancing photodynamic therapy and further amplifying oxidative stress. Overall, this work highlights the possibility of endogenous ferroptosis via spatiotemporally destroying ferritin, offering a paradigm for synergistic ferroptosis&#8211;photodynamic antitumor therapy.

         <title>Rapidly Photocurable Solid&#8208;State Poly(ionic liquid) Ionogels For Thermally Robust and Flexible Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ polymerization of rationally formulated poly(ionic liquid) ionogels enables rapid curing within a minute, forming highly transparent and stretchable electrolytes with excellent thermal, electrochemical, and air stability for high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices&#160;that are operable over wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). These ionogels are used to construct curved electrochromic eye protectors and flexible electrochromic displays, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.








Abstract
Formation of ionogels through in situ polymerization can effectively improve electrolyte processability; however, the curing process has been slow and oxygen&#8208;sensitive. Considering the low oxygen solubility of poly(ionic liquid)s (PILs), in situ polymerized ionogels are designed to realize excellent electrolytes. Herein, two in situ polymerized ionogels (PIL A &amp; PIL B) are formulated, and they can be rapidly photocured within a minute. The ionogels are highly transparent, stretchable, and exhibit excellent physicochemical stability, including thermal, electrochemical, and air stability, allowing them to perform in various conditions. Benefitting from these properties, two high&#8208;performance electrochromic devices (ECDs) are assembled, with iron&#8208;centered coordination polymer (FeCP) and tungsten oxide (P&#8208;WO3) electrochromic materials, achieving high color contrast (45.2% and 56.4%), fast response time (1.5/1.9 and 1.7/6.4 s), and excellent cycling endurance (&gt;90% retention over 3000 cycles). Attributed to the thermal robustness of the ionogels, the ECDs can also be operated over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20 to 100 &#176;C). With the use of deformable substrates (e.g., ultrathin ITO glass), curved electrochromic eye protector and flexible electrochromic displays are realized, highlighting their potential use in futuristic wearables.

         <title>Decoupled Solar Energy Storage and Dark Photocatalysis in a 3D Metal&#8211;Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material is showcased that combines light harvesting, photoinduced free&#8208;electron generation, and long&#8208;lived electron storage over several weeks. This phenomenon arises from the geometry&#8208;constraining confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for dark photocatalysis and light&#8208;driven multicycle recharging is demonstrated, highlighting a candidate material toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.








Abstract
Materials enabling solar energy conversion and long&#8208;term storage for readily available electrical and chemical energy are key for off&#8208;grid energy distribution. Herein, the specific confinement of a rhenium coordination complex in a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) unlocks a unique electron accumulating property under visible&#8208;light irradiation. About 15&#160;C gMOF&#8722;1 of electric charges can be concentrated and stored for over four weeks without loss. Decoupled, on&#8208;demand discharge for electrochemical reactions and H2 evolution catalysis is shown and light&#8208;driven recharging can be conducted for &gt;10 cycles with &#8776;90% of the initial charging capacity retained. Experimental investigations and theoretical calculations link electron trapping to MOF&#8208;induced geometry constraints as well as the coordination environment of the Re&#8208;center, highlighting the key role of MOF confinement on molecular guests. This study serves as the seminal report on 3D porous colloids achieving photoaccumulation of long&#8208;lived electrons, unlocking dark photocatalysis, and a path toward solar capacitor and solar battery systems.

         <title>A Manganese&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Cold&#8208;Adapted Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme of manganese&#8208;containing metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and developed by mimicking the structural features of the natural counterparts. It exhibits extremely stable oxidase&#8208;like activity at both psychrophilic and mesophilic condition (0&#8211;45&#160;&#176;C). Furthermore, a low&#8208;temperature antivirus strategy is innovatively established based on nMnBTC to inactive influenza virus H1N1 with high efficiency at &#8722;20 &#176;C.








Abstract
The development of cold&#8208;adapted enzymes with high efficiency and good stability is an advanced strategy to overcome the limitations of catalytic medicine in low and cryogenic temperatures. In this work, inspired by natural enzymes, a novel cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme based on a manganese&#8208;based nanosized metal&#8211;organic framework (nMnBTC) is designed and synthesized. The nMnBTC as an oxidase mimetic not only exhibits excellent activity at 0&#160;&#176;C, but also presents almost no observable activity loss as the temperature is increased to 45&#160;&#176;C. This breaks the traditional recognition that enzymes show maximum activity only under specific psychrophilic or thermophilic condition. The superior performance of nMnBTC as a cold&#8208;adapted nanozyme can be attributed to its high&#8208;catalytic efficiency at low temperature, good substrate affinity, and flexible conformation. Based on the robust performance of nMnBTC, a low&#8208;temperature antiviral strategy is developed to inactivate influenza virus H1N1 even at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. These results not only provide an important guide for the rational design of highly efficient artificial cold&#8208;adapted enzymes, but also pave a novel way for biomedical application in cryogenic fields.

         <title>A Wide Bandgap Halide Perovskite Based Self&#8208;Powered Blue Photodetector with 84.9% of External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance and self&#8208;powered blue perovskite photodetector (PPD) is developed by designing and optimizing A&#8208;site of APb(Br0.65Cl0.35)3 (A = formamidinium (FA+), methylammonium (MA+), Cs+) perovskites (PVSKs). The incorporation of Cs+ into FA/MA&#8208;PVSKs reduces the lattice strain and defect density. Consequently, a best&#8208;performing Cs&#8208;incorporating device shows an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9% which is the highest EQE reported in blue PDs.








Abstract
A self&#8208;powered, color&#8208;filter&#8208;free blue photodetector (PD) based on halide perovskites is reported. A high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 84.9%, which is the highest reported EQE in blue PDs, is achieved by engineering the A&#8208;site monovalent cations of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites. The optimized composition of formamidinium (FA)/methylammonium (MA) increases the heat of formation, yielding a uniform and smooth film. The incorporation of Cs+ ions into the FA/MA composition suppresses the trap density and increases charge&#8208;carrier mobility, yielding the highest average EQE of 77.4%, responsivity of 0.280&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, and detectivity of 5.08 &#215; 1012 Jones under blue light. Furthermore, Cs+ improves durability under repetitive operations and ambient atmosphere. The proposed device exhibits peak responsivity of 0.307&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1, which is higher than that of the commercial InGaN&#8208;based blue PD (0.289&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1). This study will promote the development of next&#8208;generation image sensors with vertically stacked perovskite PDs.

         <title>Spatially Resolved Polarization Manipulation of Ferroelectricity in Twisted hBN</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectricity is generated in twisted hBN flakes, which are used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction. Spatially resolved investigation by a conductive atomic force microscope tip reveals the unconventional ferroelectricity in this system, including lattice&#8208;slide&#8208;induced domain change, an unusual relationship between the tunneling resistance and polarization, and highly spatially dependent ferroelectric hysteresis.








Abstract
Robust room&#8208;temperature interfacial ferroelectricity has been formed in the 2D&#160;limit by simply twisting two atomic layers of non&#8208;ferroelectric hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). A thorough understanding of this newly discovered ferroelectric system is required. Here, twisted hBN is used as a tunneling junction and it is studied at the nanometer scale using conductive atomic force microscopy. Three properties unique to this system are discovered. First, the polarization dependence of the tunneling resistance contrasts with the conventional theory. Second, the ferroelectric domains can be controlled using mechanical stress, highlighting the original meaning of the emergent &#8220;slidetronics&#8221;. Third, ferroelectric hysteresis is highly spatially dependent. The hysteresis is symmetric at the domain walls. A few nanometers away, the hysteresis shifts completely to the positive or negative side, depending on the original polarization. These findings reveal the unconventional ferroelectricity in this 2D system.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Accelerated Development of Efficient Mixed Protonic&#8211;Electronic Conducting Oxides as the Air Electrodes for Protonic Ceramic Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine&#8208;learning models are constructed to predict the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of the 3200 newly mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Subsequently, the screened oxide (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 with the highest HPC is synthesized, and it is applied as an air electrode for the protonic ceramic cells operating in both electrolysis and fuel cell modes at intermediate temperatures.








Abstract
Currently, the development of high&#8208;performance protonic ceramic cells (PCCs) is limited by the scarcity of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides that can act as air electrodes to satisfy the high protonic conductivity of electrolytes. Despite the extensive research efforts in the past decades, the development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides still remains in a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process, which is extremely time consuming and high cost. Herein, based on the data acquired from the published literature, the machine&#8208;learning (ML) method is introduced to accelerate the discovery of efficient mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Accordingly, the hydrated proton concentration (HPC) of 3200 oxides is predicted to evaluate the proton conduction that is essential for enhancing the electrochemical performances of PCCs. Subsequently, feature importance for HPC is evaluated to establish a guideline for rapid and accurate design and development of high&#8208;efficiency mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides. Thereafter, screened (La0.7Ca0.3)(Co0.8Ni0.2)O3 (LCCN7382) is prepared, and the experimental HPC adequately corresponds with the predicted results. Moreover, the PCC with LCCN7382 exhibits satisfactory electrochemical performances in electrolysis and fuel cell modes. In addition to the development of a promising air electrode for PCC, this study establishes a new avenue for ML&#8208;based development of mixed protonic&#8211;electronic conducting oxides.

         <title>Dynamic Assembly of Viscoelastic Networks by Aqueous Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8211;Solid Phase Separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks is achieved for the first time by aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (AqLL&#8208;LS PS2). The networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated droplets as templates, followed by liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the continuous phase.








Abstract
Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal networks, which can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, a new aqueous two&#8208;phase system (ATPS) is proposed, which consists of poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to regulate the self&#8208;assembly of condensates on&#8208;demand. Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase&#8208;separated DEX droplets as templates and the following liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition of the PNIPAM&#8208;rich phase. The resulting networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 min. This work demonstrates rich phase&#8208;separation behaviors in a single ATPS through incorporating stimuli&#8208;responsive polymers. The concept can potentially be applied to other macromolecules through other stimuli to develop materials with rich phase behaviors and hierarchical structures.

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic assembly of viscoelastic networks is achieved for the first time by aqueous liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8211;solid phase separation (AqLL-LS PS&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase-separated droplets as templates, followed by liquid-to-solid transition of the continuous phase.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living cells comprise diverse subcellular structures, such as cytoskeletal networks, which can regulate essential cellular activities through dynamic assembly and synergistic interactions with biomolecular condensates. Despite extensive efforts, reproducing viscoelastic networks for modulating biomolecular condensates in synthetic systems remains challenging. Here, a new aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) is proposed, which consists of poly(&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) and dextran (DEX), to construct viscoelastic networks capable of being assembled and dissociated dynamically to regulate the self-assembly of condensates on-demand. Viscoelastic networks are generated using liquid&#8211;liquid phase-separated DEX droplets as templates and the following liquid-to-solid transition of the PNIPAM-rich phase. The resulting networks can dissolve liquid fused in sarcoma (FUS) condensates within 5 min. This work demonstrates rich phase-separation behaviors in a single ATPS through incorporating stimuli-responsive polymers. The concept can potentially be applied to other macromolecules through other stimuli to develop materials with rich phase behaviors and hierarchical structures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Charged interfaces are a central functional domain for advanced energy materials and biomacromolecules. Predictive simulations play a pivotal role in understanding molecular mechanisms, optimizing performance metrics, and providing rational design strategies for novel advanced materials.








Abstract
Electrostatic interactions play a dominant role in charged materials systems. Understanding the complex correlation between macroscopic properties with microscopic structures is of critical importance to develop rational design strategies for advanced materials. But the complexity of this challenging task is augmented by interfaces present in the charged materials systems, such as electrode&#8211;electrolyte interfaces or biological membranes. Over the last decades, predictive molecular simulations that are founded in fundamental physics and optimized for charged interfacial systems have proven their value in providing molecular understanding of physicochemical properties and functional mechanisms for diverse materials. Novel design strategies utilizing predictive models have been suggested as promising route for the rational design of materials with tailored properties. Here, an overview of recent advances in the understanding of charged interfacial systems aided by predictive molecular simulations is presented. Focusing on three types of charged interfaces found in energy materials and biomacromolecules, how the molecular models characterize ion structure, charge transport, morphology relation to the environment, and the thermodynamics/kinetics of molecular binding at the interfaces is discussed. The critical analysis brings two prominent field of energy materials and biological science under common perspective, to stimulate crossover in both research field that have been largely&#160;separated.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Crowding Effect Mimicking Cold&#8208;Resistant Plants to Stabilize the Zinc Anode with Wider Service Temperature Range</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecular crowding electrolyte is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Betaine in the electrolyte can regulate the solvation sheath of Zn2+ and adsorb on the Zn anode to guide the dendrite&#8208;free deposition of Zn2+. A high concentration of betaine breaks the H&#8208;bond between H2O, which keeps the Zn anode stable in a wide temperature range from &#8722;30 to 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Growth of dendrites, the low plating/stripping efficiency of Zn anodes, and the high freezing point of aqueous electrolytes hinder the practical application of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries. Here, a zwitterionic osmolyte&#8208;based molecular crowding electrolyte is presented, by adding betaine (Bet, a by&#8208;product from beet plant) to the aqueous electrolyte, to solve the abovementioned problems. Substantive verification tests, density functional theory calculations, and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations consistently reveal that side reactions and growth of Zn dendrites are restrained because Bet can break Zn2+ solvation and regulate oriented 2D Zn2+ deposition. The Bet/ZnSO4 electrolyte enables superior reversibility in a Zn&#63743;Cu half&#8208;cell to achieve a high Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.9% for 900 cycles (&#8776;1800 h), and dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping in Zn&#63743;Zn cells for 4235 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2 and 0.5 mAh cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, a high concentration of Bet lowers the freezing point of the electrolyte to &#8722;92 &#176;C via the molecular&#8208;crowding effect, which ensures the stable operation of the aqueous batteries at &#8722;30 &#176;C. This innovative concept of such a molecular crowding electrolyte will inject new vitality into the development of multifunctional aqueous electrolytes.

Tetradentate gold(III) thermally activated delayed fluorescent complexes, showing&#160;green emission with near&#8208;unity &#934; and kr approaching 2 &#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films,&#160;are reported. The vacuum&#8208;deposited organic light&#8208;emitting diodes based on them demonstrate maximum external quantum efficiency of up to 27% with reduced efficiency roll&#8208;offs and LT90 device lifetimes of up to 1820 h at 1000 cd m&#8722;2.








Abstract
High maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax), small efficiency roll&#8208;offs, and long operational lifetime at practical luminances are three crucial parameters for commercialization of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). To simultaneously achieve these goals, it is desirable to have the radiative decay rate constant (kr) as large as possible, which, for a thermally activated delayed fluorescent (TADF) emitter, requires both a large S1&#8594;S0 radiative decay rate constant (krS) and a small singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap (&#916;EST). Here, the design of a class of tetradentate gold(III) TADF complexes for narrowing the &#916;EST while keeping the krS large is reported. The as&#8208;synthesized complexes display green emission with close to unity emission quantum yields, and kr approaching 2&#160;&#215; 106 s&#8722;1 in thin films. The vacuum&#8208;deposited green OLEDs based on 1 and 4 demonstrate maximum EQEs of up to 24 and 27% with efficiency roll&#8208;offs of 5.5 and 2.2% at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, respectively; the EQEs maintain high at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 (19% (1) and 24% (4)). A long LT90 device lifetime of 1820&#160;h at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for complex 1 is achieved, which is one of the longest device lifetimes of TADF&#8208;OLEDs reported in the literature.

         <title>Metabolic Homeostasis&#8208;Regulated Nanoparticles for Antibody&#8208;Independent Cancer Radio&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to modulate the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment aggravated by X&#8208;ray irradiation, a liposome loaded with mannose and levamisole (M/LM&#8208;Lipo) is developed for cellular metabolism regulation and macrophage polarization. The M/LM&#8208;Lipo orchestrates radio&#8208;immunotherapy by the simultaneous modulation of glucose and mitochondrial metabolic pathways in both cancer cells and macrophages, achieving systematic antitumor immune response for effective tumor ablation and metastasis elimination.








Abstract
The special metabolic traits of cancer cells and tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME) are promising targets for developing novel cancer therapy strategies, especially the glycolysis and mitochondrial energy metabolism. However, therapies targeting a singular metabolic pathway are always counteracted by the metabolic reprogramming of cancer, resulting in unsatisfactory therapeutic effect. Herein, this work employs poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;coated (PEGylated) liposomes as the drug delivery system for both mannose and levamisole hydrochloride to simultaneously inhibit glycolysis and restrain mitochondrial energy metabolism and thus inhibit tumor growth. In combination with radiotherapy, the liposomes can not only modulate the immunosuppressive TME by cellular metabolism regulation to achieve potent therapeutic effect for local tumors, but also suppress the M2 macrophage proliferation triggered by X&#8208;ray irradiation and thus enhance the immune response to inhibit metastatic lesions. In brief, this work provides a new therapeutic strategy targeting the special metabolic traits of cancer cells and immunosuppressive TAMs to enhance the abscopal effect of radiotherapy for cancer.

In combination with radiotherapy, the liposomes can not only modulate the immunosuppressive TME by cellular metabolism regulation to achieve potent therapeutic effect for local tumors, but also suppress the M2 macrophage proliferation triggered by X-ray irradiation and thus enhance the immune response to inhibit metastatic lesions. In brief, this work provides a new therapeutic strategy targeting the special metabolic traits of cancer cells and immunosuppressive TAMs to enhance the abscopal effect of radiotherapy for cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Single&#8208;Transistor Neuron with Excitatory&#8211;Inhibitory Spatiotemporal Dynamics Applied for Neuronal Oscillations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;transistor neuron with excitatory&#8211;inhibitory spatiotemporal dynamics is constructed by integrating a threshold switch with a 2D MoS2&#160;channel, which exhibits bio&#8208;realistic dynamics to achieve essential neuronal functions such as leaky integration, threshold&#8208;driven fire, inhibition, and self&#8208;recovery. The device can be adopted to emulate high&#8208;dimensional population code&#8212;neuronal oscillations and support information integration and synchronization.








Abstract
Brain&#8208;inspired neuromorphic computing systems with the potential to drive the next wave of artificial intelligence demand a spectrum of critical components beyond simple characteristics. An emerging research trend is to achieve advanced functions with ultracompact neuromorphic devices. In this work, a single&#8208;transistor neuron is demonstrated that implements excitatory&#8211;inhibitory (E&#8211;I) spatiotemporal integration and a series of essential neuron behaviors. Neuronal oscillations, the fundamental mode of neuronal communication, that construct high&#8208;dimensional population code to achieve efficient computing in the brain, can also be demonstrated by the neuron transistors. The highly scalable E&#8211;I neuron can be the basic building block for implementing core neuronal circuit motifs and large&#8208;scale architectural plans to replicate energy&#8208;efficient neural computations, forming the foundation of future integrated neuromorphic systems.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Nanozyme with Asymmetric Electron Distribution for Tumor Catalytic Therapy by Disrupting Tumor Redox and Energy Metabolism Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanozyme catalytic therapy triggered by tumor&#8208;specific endogenous stimuli is an emerging tumor therapy that attracts wide attention. However, the current therapeutic efficacy of nanozyme catalytic therapy is severely limited by the catalytic efficiency of nanozymes and the concentration of endogenous reaction substrates. Herein, we developed a novel and efficient Ir&#8208;N5 single&#8208;atom (Ir&#8208;N5 SA) nanozyme with multiple enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activities. Due to the synergistic effect of central Ir single atom and axial N coordination, Ir&#8208;N5 SA exhibits better enzymatic catalytic performance than Ir&#8208;N4 SA. At tumor sites, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can generate a large amount of ROS through OXD&#8208;like and POD&#8208;like catalytic activities. Moreover, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can also generate O2 and H2O2 through catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and NADH oxidase (NOX)&#8208;like catalytic activities, realizing the efficient nanozyme catalytic therapy in a substrate&#8208;cycle manner. Additionally, Ir&#8208;N5 SA can effectively break the intracellular NADH/NAD+ cycle balance by mimicking NOX, and then cooperate with fatty acid synthase cerulenin (Cer) to interfere with the energy metabolism homeostasis of tumor cells. Consequently, our designed Ir&#8208;N5 SA/Cer nanoagent can disrupts redox and metabolic homeostasis in the tumor region through enzyme&#8208;mimicking cascades reaction, effectively overcoming the shortcomings of current nanozyme catalytic therapy.

         <title>Thermal&#8208;Driven Point Defect Transformation in Antimony Selenosulfide Photovoltaic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thermal treatment of inorganic thin films is a general and necessary step to facilitate crystallization and, in particular, to regulate the formation of point defects. Understanding the dependence of the defect formation mechanism on the annealing process is a critical challenge in terms of designing material synthesis approaches for obtaining the desired optoelectronic properties. Herein, we present a mechanistic understanding of the evolution of defects in emerging Sb2(S, Se)3 solar cell films. We adopted a top&#8208;efficiency Sb2(S, Se)3 solar&#8208;cell film in this study to consolidate our investigation. Our study reveals that the as&#8208;deposited Sb2(S, Se)3 film under hydrothermal conditions generates defects with a high formation energy, demonstrating kinetically favorable defect formation characteristics. Annealing at elevated temperatures leads to a two&#8208;step defect transformation process: (1) formation of sulfur and selenium vacancy defects, followed by (2) migration of antimony ions to fill the vacancy defects. This process finally results in the generation of cation&#8208;anion anti&#8208;site defects, which exhibit low formation energy, suggesting a thermodynamically favorable defect formation feature. This study establishes a new strategy for the fundamental investigation of the evolution of deep&#8208;level defects in metal chalcogenide films, and provides guidance for designing material synthesis strategies in terms of defect control.

         <title>High&#8208;entropy Alloy Aerogels: A New Platform for Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (HEAAs) combined with the advantages of high&#8208;entropy alloys and aerogels are prospective new platforms in catalytic reactions. However, due to the differences in reduction potentials and miscibility behavior of different metals, the realization of HEAAs with a single phase is still a great challenge. Herein, we fabricate a series of HEAAs via freeze&#8208;thaw method as highly active and durable electrocatalysts for CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). Especially, the PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs could achieve Faradaic efficiency (FE) of C1 products almost 100% from &#8208;0.7 to &#8208;1.1&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), and a maximum FEHCOOH of 98.1% at &#8208;1.1 VRHE, outperforming the PdCuAuAgBiIn high&#8208;entropy alloy particles (HEAPs) and Pd metallic aerogels (MAs). Specifically, the current density and FEHCOOH are almost 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 87% in a flow cell. The impressive CO2RR performance of PdCuAuAgBiIn HEAAs is attributed to the strong interactions between different metals and surface unsaturated sites, which can regulate the electronic structures of different metals and allow the optimal HCOO* intermediate adsorption and desorption onto the catalysts surface to enhance HCOOH production. The work not only provides a facile synthetic strategy to fabricate HEAAs, but also opens the avenue for development of efficient catalysts and beyond.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, we present a high&#8208;performance flexible PD by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8764;106, a fast response time of 67 &#956;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7 &#215; 1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804; 0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Surface hydrophobization provides hygroscopic supramolecular plastics based on polysaccharides with damage&#8208;Specific healability and room&#8208;Temperature recyclability</title>

Abstract
Supramolecular materials with room&#8208;temperature healability and recyclability are highly desired because they could extend materials lifetimes and reduce resources consumption. Most approaches towards healing and recycling rely on the dynamically reversible supramolecular interactions, such as hydrogen, ionic and coordinate bonds, which are hygroscopic and vulnerable to water. The general water&#8208;induced plasticization facilitates the healing and reprocessing process but cause a troubling problem of random self&#8208;adhesion. To address this issue, here we report that by modifying the hygroscopic surfaces with hydrophobic alkyl chains of dodecyltrimethoxysilane (DTMS), supramolecular plastic films based on commercial raw materials of sodium alginate (SA) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) display extraordinary damage&#8208;specific healability. Owing to the hydrophobic surfaces, the random self&#8208;adhesion is eliminated even under humid environment. When damage occurs, the fresh surfaces with ionic groups and hydroxyl groups expose exclusively at the damaged site. Thus, damage&#8208;specific healing can be readily facilitated by the water&#8208;induced plasticization. Moreover, the films display excellent room&#8208;temperature recyclability. After multiple times of reprocessing and re&#8208;modifying with DTMS, the rejuvenated films exhibit fatigueless mechanical properties. We anticipate this approach to damage&#8208;specific healing and room&#8208;temperature recycling based on surface hydrophobization can be applied to design various of supramolecular plastic polysaccharides materials for building sustainable societies.

         <title>A Materials Acceleration Platform for Organic Laser Discovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional materials discovery is a laborious and time&#8208;consuming process that can take decades from initial conception of the material to commercialization. Recent developments in materials acceleration platforms promise to accelerate materials discovery using automation of experiments coupled with machine learning. However, most of the automation efforts in chemistry focus on synthesis and compound identification, with integrated target property characterization receiving less attention. In this work, we introduce an automated platform for the discovery of molecules as gain mediums for organic semiconductor lasers, a problem that has been challenging for conventional approaches. Our platform encompasses automated lego&#8208;like synthesis, product identification, and optical characterization that can be executed in a fully integrated end&#8208;to&#8208;end fashion. Using this workflow to screen organic laser candidates, we have discovered 8 potential candidates for organic lasers. We test the lasing threshold of 4 molecules in thin&#8208;film devices and find 2 molecules with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance. These promising results show the potential of automated synthesis and screening for accelerated materials development.

         <title>Discovery of Type II interlayer trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdW HS) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions have been investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdW HS, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions and poor interface quality, etc. Here we report the first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8208;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L + 2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. Our results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8208;inorganic bilayers.

         <title>Conversion of Classical Light Emission from a Nanoparticle&#8208;Strained WSe2 Monolayer into Quantum Light Emission via Electron Beam Irradiation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solid&#8208;state single photon emitters (SPEs) within atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have recently attracted interest as scalable quantum light sources for quantum photonic technologies. Among TMDs, WSe2 monolayers (MLs) are promising for the deterministic fabrication and engineering of SPEs using local strain fields. The ability to reliably produce isolatable SPEs in WSe2 is currently impeded by the presence of numerous spectrally overlapping states that occur at strained locations. Here we employ nanoparticle (NP) arrays with precisely defined positions and sizes to deterministically create strain fields in WSe2 MLs, thus enabling the systematic investigation and control of SPE formation. Using this platform, electron beam irradiation at NP&#8208;strained locations transforms spectrally overlapped sub&#8208;bandgap emission states into isolatable, anti&#8208;bunched quantum emitters. The dependence of the emission spectra of WSe2 MLs as a function of strain magnitude and exposure time to electron beam irradiation is quantified and provides insight into the mechanism for SPE production. Excitons selectively funnel through strongly coupled sub&#8208;bandgap states introduced by electron beam irradiation, which suppresses spectrally overlapping emission pathways and leads to measurable anti&#8208;bunched behavior. Our findings provide a strategy to generate isolatable SPEs in 2D materials with a well&#8208;defined energy range.

         <title>Improving OFF&#8208;State Bias&#8208;Stress Stability in High&#8208;Mobility Conjugated Polymer Transistors with an Anti&#8208;Solvent Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conjugated polymer field&#8208;effect transistors are emerging as an enabling technology for flexible electronics due to their excellent mechanical properties combined with sufficiently high charge carrier mobilities and compatibility with large&#8208;area, low&#8208;temperature processing. However, their electrical stability remains a concern. ON&#8208;state (accumulation mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities in organic semiconductors have been widely studied, and multiple mitigation strategies have been suggested. In contrast, OFF&#8208;state (depletion mode) bias&#8208;stress instabilities remain poorly understood despite being crucial for many applications in which the transistors are held in their OFF&#8208;state for most of the time. Here, we present a simple method of using an anti&#8208;solvent treatment to achieve significant improvements in OFF&#8208;state bias&#8208;stress and environmental stability as well as general device performance for one of the best performing polymers, solution&#8208;processable indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDT&#8208;BT). IDT&#8208;BT is weakly crystalline, and we attribute the notable improvements to an anti&#8208;solvent&#8208;induced, increased degree of crystallinity, resulting in a lower probability of electron trapping and the removal of charge traps. Our work highlights the importance of the microstructure in weakly crystalline polymer films and offers a simple processing strategy for achieving the reliability required for applications in flexible electronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;induced agglomeration of single&#8208;atom platinum in photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here we describe the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. DFT calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Hierarchical Porous Monoliths of Steel with Self&#8208;Reinforcing Adaptive Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Porous structures offer an attractive approach to reducing the amount of natural resources used while maintaining relatively high mechanical efficiency. However, for some applications the drop in mechanical properties resulting from the introduction of porosity is too high, which has limited the broader utilization of porous materials in industry. Here, we show that steel monoliths can be designed to display high mechanical efficiency and reversible self&#8208;reinforcing properties when made with porous architectures with up to three hierarchical levels. Ultralight steel structures that can float on water and autonomously adapt their stiffness were manufactured by the thermal reduction and sintering of three&#8208;dimensionally printed foam templates. Using distinct mechanical testing techniques, image analysis, and finite element simulations, we study the mechanisms leading to the high mechanical efficiency and self&#8208;stiffening ability of the hierarchical porous monoliths. The design and fabrication of mechanically stable porous monoliths using iron as a widely available natural resource is expected to contribute to the future development of functional materials with a more sustainable footprint.

         <title>Hygroscopic&#8208;Microgels&#8208;Enabled Rapid Water Extraction from Arid Air</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hygroscopic microgels (HMGs), composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and salt, are developed for extracting moisture from arid air. The HMGs can realize rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics by short&#8208;distance diffusion in microgels and thermoresponsiveness of HPC, exhibiting 24&#8211;36 cycles of operation per day at low RH with potential water yield of 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Sorbent&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) has emerged as a promising decentralized water&#8208;production technology to mitigate the freshwater crisis in arid areas. Hydrogels have been regarded as attractive sorbents due to their high water retention and tailorable polymer&#8211;water interactions. Yet, the kinetics of water sorption and desorption at low relative humidity (RH) shall be improved for their practical implementation. Here, hygroscopic microgels (HMGs) composed of hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hygroscopic salt are reported, which achieve a water uptake of ca. 0.5&#8211;0.8&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% RH. HMGs enable rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics owing to the short&#8208;distance diffusion in the microgels and hydrophilicity&#8211;hydrophobicity switching of the thermoresponsive HPC. To validate the feasibility of HMGs for moisture extraction, a potential daily water collection of up to equivalent 7.9&#8211;19.1 L kg&#8722;1 at low RH is demonstrated, enabled by 24&#8211;36 operation cycles per day based on the material&#8208;level experiments. With renewable raw materials and superior performance, HMGs provide a sustainable approach for rapid moisture extraction in arid climates.

         <title>Rationally Reconstructed Metal&#8208;organic Frameworks as Robust Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Although the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) based materials have become one of the most important types of electrocatalysts for the sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER), a novel design strategy for the MOF structure is highly needed to overcome the current development bottleneck of the electrochemical performance. Reconstructing MOFs towards a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented OER electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet due to the significant challenges during the synthesis. Here, we report the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure, viz., from MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe to MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites. Theoretical calculations have revealed that the Fe sites in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH with uncoordinated phenolic hydroxyls are more electroactive than that in MOF&#8208;74&#8208;Fe. Benefiting from this desired electronic structure, the designed MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH catalyst exhibits high intrinsic OER activity, including a low overpotential of 215&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, low Tafel slope of 45.4&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 and high turnover frequency (TOF) of 1.44 s&#8722;1 at 300&#160;mV overpotential, over 80 times that of the commercial IrO2 catalyst (0.0177 s&#8722;1). The radically reduced eg&#8208;t2g crystal field splitting in Fe&#8208;3d and thus the much suppressed electron hopping barriers through the synergistic effects of the O species from the coordinated carboxyl groups and the uncoordinated phenolic groups guarantee the efficient OER in MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH. Consistent with the DFT calculations, the real&#8208;time kinetic simulation reveals that the conversion from O* to OOH* is the rate&#8208;determining step on the active sites of MIL&#8208;53(Fe)&#8208;2OH. This work establishes a MOF platform to systematically investigate the structure&#8208;property relationship for rationally designing and fabricating robust OER electrocatalysts in the future.

Reconstructing MOFs towards a designed framework structure provides breakthrough opportunities to achieve unprecedented OER electrocatalytic performance, but has rarely, if ever, been proposed and investigated yet due to the significant challenges during the synthesis. Here, we report the first successful fabrication of a robust OER electrocatalyst by precision reconstruction of an MOF structure, viz., from MOF-74-Fe to MIL-53(Fe)-2OH with different coordination environments at the active sites.

         <title>Ultrafast Spectroscopy of Plasmons and Free Carriers in 2D MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) MXenes have diverse and chemically tunable optical properties that arise from an interplay between free carriers, interband transitions and plasmon resonances. The nature of photoexcitations and their dynamics in three different members of MXene family, Ti3C2, Mo2Ti2C3, and Nb2C, were investigated using two complementary pump&#8208;probe techniques, transient optical absorption and time&#8208;resolved terahertz (THz) spectroscopy. Measurements reveal pronounced plasmonic effects in the visible and near&#8208;IR in all three MXenes. Optical excitation, with either 400&#160;nm or 800&#160;nm pulses, results in rapid increase in lattice temperature, evidenced by a pronounced broadening of the plasmon mode which presents as a plasmon bleach in transient absorption measurements. Observed kinetics of plasmon bleach recovery provide a means to monitor lattice cooling. Remarkably slow cooling, proceeding over hundreds of picoseconds to nanoseconds time scales, implies MXenes have low thermal conductivities. The slowest recovery kinetics were observed in the MXenes with the highest free carrier density which supports phonon scattering by free carriers as a possible mechanism limiting thermal conductivity. These new insights into photoexcitation dynamics can facilitate their applications in photothermal solar energy conversion, plasmonic devices and even photothermal therapy and drug delivery.

         <title>Molecularly Tailored Photosensitizer with an Efficiency of 13.2% for Dye&#8208;Sensitized Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Photosensitizers yielding superior photocurrents are crucial for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized solar cells (DSCs). Herein, we present two molecularly tailored organic sensitizers, coded ZS4 and ZS5, through judiciously employing dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8243;,3&#8243;&#8208;d]pyrrole (DTP) as the &#960;&#8208;linker and hexyloxy&#8208;substituted diphenylquinoxaline (HPQ) or naphthalene&#8208;fused&#8208;quinoxaline (NFQ) as the auxiliary electron&#8208;accepting unit, respectively. Endowed with the HPQ acceptor, ZS4 shows more efficient electron injection and charge collection based on substantially reduced interfacial charge recombination as compared to ZS5. As a result, ZS4&#8208;based DSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.2% under standard AM1.5 G sunlight, with a high short&#8208;circuit photocurrent density (Jsc) of 16.3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) of 1.05&#160;V and a fill factor (FF) of 77.1%. Remarkably, DSCs sensitized with ZS4 exhibit an outstanding stability, retaining 95% of their initial PCE under continuous light soaking for 1000&#160;h. To the best of our knowledge, this is a new record efficiency reported so far for copper&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based DSCs using a single sensitizer. Our work highlights the importance of developing molecularly tailored photosensitizers for highly efficient DSCs with copper electrolyte.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>

Abstract
Development of closed&#8208;loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in our daily life could be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy&#8208;to&#8208;recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, we report a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs), which not only display mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate (PC), but also exhibit excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra&#8208;CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogues that don't have noncovalent crosslinks show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra&#8208;CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer&#8208;monomer&#8208;polymer circulation. This work provides new design principles for high&#8208;performance chemically recyclable CANs as sustainable substitutes for the conventional plastics.

         <title>Bionic engineered protein coating boosting anti&#8208;biofouling in complex biological fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, we have developed a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsions of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Retinomorphic Device for Spontaneous Chromatic Adaptation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A retinomorphic vision sensor based on bilayer platinum diselenide (PtSe2) is proposed. The sensor mimics the chromatic adaptation of the human retina. The photocontrolled adsorption and desorption of O2 molecules on the PtSe2 surface lead to wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoconductivity. Spontaneous chromatic adaptation based on this device provides a basis for developing artificial vision perception systems with simplified circuitry.








Abstract
Chromatic adaptation refers to the sensing and preprocessing of the spectral composition of incident light on the retina, and it is important for color&#8208;image recognition. It is challenging to apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images via the same physical process using the complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology because of redundant data detection, complicated signal conversion processes, and the requirement for additional memory modules. Inspired by the highly efficient chromatic adaptation of the human retina, a 2D oxygen&#8208;mediated platinum diselenide (PtSe2) device is presented to simultaneously apply sensing, memory, and processing functions to color images. The device exhibits a wavelength&#8208;dependent bipolar photoresponse and the linear pulse&#8208;number dependence of photoconductivity, which is dominated by the photon&#8208;mediated physical adsorption and desorption of oxygen molecules on bilayer PtSe2. The proposed retinomorphic device shows superior image classification accuracy (over 90%) compared to an independent pseudocolor channel (less than 75%). Hence, it is promising for developing artificial vision perception systems with reduced architectural complexity.

         <title>A Defect&#8208;Engineered Nanozyme&#160;for Targeted NIR&#8208;II Photothermal Immunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By taking advantage of defect engineering, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme is developed for combinational second near&#8208;infrared photothermal immunotherapy of cancer. This controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory.








Abstract
Multienzyme&#8208;mimicking redox nanozymes, curated by defect engineering, in synergy with immunotherapy offer promising prospects for safe and efficient cancer therapy. However, the spatiotemporally precise immune response often gets challenged by off&#8208;target adverse effects and insufficient therapeutic response. Herein, a tumor cell membrane coated redox nanozyme (CMO&#8208;R@4T1) is reported for combinational second near&#8208;infrared window (NIR&#8208;II) photothermal immunotherapy. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 consists of a Cu&#8208;doped MoOx (CMO) nanozyme as the core, which is cloaked with tumor&#8208;cell&#8208;derived fused membranes with immunostimulants immobilized in the membrane shell. In addition to the enhanced tumor accumulation, the nanozyme can cause oxidative damage to tumor cells by the production of reactive oxygen species and attenuation of the antioxidant mechanism. CMO&#8208;R@4T1 also mediates a photothermal effect under NIR&#8208;II photoirradiation to trigger tumor eradication and immunogenic cell death, where the liberated agonist elicits the immune activation. Such a controlled therapeutic paradigm potentiates systemic primary tumor ablation, inhibits cancer metastasis to distant tumor, and procures long&#8208;term immunological memory. Thereby, this study takes advantage of defect engineering to illustrate a generic strategy to prepare cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;camouflaged nanozymes for targeted photo&#8208;immunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Switchable Ion Current Saturation Regimes Enabled via Heterostructured Nanofluidic Devices Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanofluidic devices displaying switchable ion current saturation regimes can be realized by integration of UiO&#8208;66 metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) into asymmetric nanochannels. These unusual transport properties stem from the interplay between the permselectivity and heterostructure of the MOF&#8208;modified nanochannels. These devices can operate over a wide range of saline concentrations and their properties can be reversibly modulated by changing the pH.








Abstract
The use of track&#8208;etched membranes allows further fine&#8208;tuning of transport regimes and thus enables their use in (bio)sensing and energy&#8208;harvesting applications, among others. Recently, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been combined with such membranes to further increase their potential. Herein, the creation of a single track&#8208;etched nanochannel modified with the UiO&#8208;66 MOF is proposed. By the interfacial growth method, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;confined synthesis fills the nanochannel completely and smoothly, yet its constructional porosity renders a heterostructure along the axial coordinate of the channel. The MOF heterostructure confers notorious changes in the transport regime of the nanofluidic device. In particular, the tortuosity provided by the micro&#8208; and mesostructure of UiO&#8208;66 added to its charged state leads to iontronic outputs characterized by an asymmetric ion current saturation for transmembrane voltages exceeding 0.3&#160;V. Remarkably, this behavior can be easily and reversibly modulated by changing the pH of the media and it can also be maintained for a wide range of KCl concentrations. In addition, it is found that the modified&#8208;nanochannel functionality cannot be explained by considering just the intrinsic microporosity of UiO&#8208;66, but rather the constructional porosity that arises during the MOF growth process plays a central and dominant role.

Bulky cations are widely used in the halide perovskite field to reduce nonradiative recombination at interfaces. In this work, a critical perspective on the use of these organohalide salts is provided. It is demonstrated that some of these capping layers are unstable and prolonged annealing is proposed&#160;as a critical way to drive the selection between different bulky cations for improved stability.








Abstract
The impact of the bulky&#8208;cation&#8208;modified interfaces on halide perovskite solar cell stability is underexplored. In this work, the thermal instability of the bulky&#8208;cation interface layers used in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art solar cells is demonstrated. X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron&#8208;based grazing&#8208;incidence X&#8208;ray scattering measurements reveal significant changes in the chemical composition and structure at the surface of these films that occur under thermal stress. The changes impact charge&#8208;carrier dynamics and device operation, as shown in transient photoluminescence, excitation correlation spectroscopy, and solar cells. The type of cation used for surface treatment affects the extent of these changes, where long carbon chains provide more stable interfaces. These results highlight that prolonged annealing of the treated interfaces is critical to enable reliable reporting of performances and to drive the selection of different bulky cations.

         <title>Local Electric Field&#8208;Promoted Kinetics and Interfacial Stability of Phosphorus Anode with Ionic Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Phosphorus anode is a promising option for energy storage applications because of its high theoretical specific capacity and safe lithiation potential. However, the multiphase phosphorus lithiation/de&#8208;lithiation reactions and soluble reaction intermediates cause sluggish reaction kinetics and active materials loss. Herein, a novel local electric field (LEF) strategy is proposed to inhibit the intermediates dissolution and promote the reaction kinetics by optimizing ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs). Among them, the LEF induced by the cationic covalent organic framework effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of phosphorus anode. The strong electrostatic interaction between the polyphosphides and cationic covalent organic framework confines the dissolution of active materials and tailors the electronic structure of polyphosphides to accelerate the reaction kinetics. The cationic covalent organic framework&#8208;assisted phosphorus anode provides a high capacity of 1227.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10.4 A g&#8722;1 (8.6 C) and a high&#8208;capacity retention of 87% after 500 cycles at 1.3 A g&#8722;1. This contribution not only broadens the application of iCOFs for phosphorus anode but also inspires the great potential of local electric field in battery technology.

         <title>A MoS2 Hafnium Oxide Based Ferroelectric Encoder for Temporal&#8208;Efficient Spiking Neural Network</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Spiking neural network (SNN), where the information is evaluated recurrently through spikes, has manifested significant promises to minimize the energy expenditure in data&#8208;intensive machine learning and artificial intelligence.[6] Among these applications, the artificial neural encoders are essential to convert the external stimuli to a spiking format that can be subsequently fed to the neural network. Here, we demonstrate a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) hafnium oxide based ferroelectric encoder for temporal&#8208;efficient information processing in SNN. The fast domain switching attribute associated with the polycrystalline nature of hafnium oxide based ferroelectric material is exploited for spike encoding, rendering it suitable for realizing biomimetic encoders. Accordingly, a high&#8208;performance ferroelectric encoder is achieved, featuring a superior switching efficiency, negligible charge trapping effect, and robust ferroelectric response, which successfully enables a broad dynamic range. Furthermore, a feedforward SNN is simulated to verify the precision of the encoded information from our ferroelectric encoder, in which an average inference accuracy of 95.14% can be achieved using the MNIST dataset for digits classification. Moreover, our ferroelectric encoder manifests prominent resilience against noise injection with an overall prediction accuracy of 94.73% under various Gaussian noise levels, showing practical promises to reduce the computational load for the neural network.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Vanadium Catalyst Boosting Reaction Kinetics of Polysulfides in Na&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The practical application of the room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries is hindered by the insulated sulfur, severe shuttle effect of sodium polysulfides, and insufficient polysulfides conversion. Herein, on the basis of first principles calculations, the single atom vanadium anchored on three&#8208;dimensional N&#8208;doped hierarchical porous carbon matrix (denoted as 3D&#8208;PNCV) is designed and fabricated to enhance sulfur reactivity, and adsorption and catalytic conversion performance of sodium polysulfide. The 3D&#8208;PNCV host with abundant and active V sites, hierarchical porous structure, high electrical conductivity, and strong chemical adsorption/conversion ability of V&#8208;N bonding can immobilize the polysulfides and promote reversibly catalytic conversion of polysulfides toward Na2S. Therefore, the as&#8208;fabricated RT Na&#8208;S batteries can achieve a high reversible capacity (445 mAh g&#8722;1 over 800 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (224 mAh g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The electrocatalysis mechanism of sodium polysulfides is further experimentally and theoretically revealed, which provides a new strategy to develop the highly stable RT Na&#8208;S batteries.

         <title>Hofmeister Effect&#8208;Enhanced Hydration Chemistry of Hydrogel for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar&#8208;Driven Interfacial Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven water evaporation technology holds great potential for mitigating the global water scarcity due to its high energy conversion efficiency. Lowering the vaporization enthalpy of water is key to boost the performance of solar&#8208;driven desalination. Herein, a highly hydratable hydrogel (PMH) network, consisting of modified needle coke (MNC) as photothermal material and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) as hydratable matrix, is crafted via simple physical crosslinking method. When capitalizing on the PMH as evaporator for 3.5 wt% NaCl solution, a high evaporation rate of 3.18&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h &#8208;1 under one sun illumination is delivered, unexpectedly outperforming that in pure water (2.53&#160;kg m&#8722;2&#160;h &#8208;1). More importantly, the PMH shows a robust desalination durability, thus enabling a self&#8208;cleaning system. Further investigations reveal that the outstanding evaporation performance of PMH in brine roots in its hydrability tuned by chaotropic Cl&#8722;, wherein the Cl&#8722; can mediate the hydration chemistry of PVA in PMH and suppress related crystallinity, thus contributing to the increased content of intermediate water and the lowered vaporization enthalpy of brine. This work first scrutinizes the Hofmeister effect on the evaporation behavior of PMH evaporator in brine and provides insights for high&#8208;efficiency solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination.

         <title>A Continuous Gradient Colloidal Glass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Colloidal crystals and glasses manipulate light propagation depending on their chemical composition, particle morphology, and mesoscopic structure. This light&#8208;matter interaction has been intensely investigated, but a knowledge gap remains for mesostructures comprising a continuous property gradient of the constituting particles. Here, a general synthetic approach to bottom&#8208;up fabrication of continuous size gradient colloidal ensembles is introduced. Firstly, the technique synthesizes a dispersion with a specifically designed gradual particle size distribution. Secondly, self&#8208;assembly of this dispersion yields a photonic colloidal glass with a continuous size gradient from top to bottom. Local and bulk characterization methods are used to highlight the significant potential of this mesostructure, resulting in vivid structural colors along, and superior light scattering across the gradient. The process describes a general pathway to mesoscopic gradients. It can expectedly be transferred to a variety of other particle&#8208;based systems where continuous gradients will provide novel physical insights and&#160;functionalities.

         <title>Self&#8208;sustained Snapping Drives Autonomous Dancing and Motion in Free&#8208;standing Wavy Rings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Harnessing snapping, an instability phenomenon observed in nature (e.g., Venus flytraps), for autonomy has attracted growing interest in autonomous soft robots. However, achieving self&#8208;sustained snapping and snapping&#8208;driven autonomous motions in soft robots remains largely unexplored. Here, we report harnessing bistable, ribbon ring&#8208;like structures for realizing self&#8208;sustained snapping in a library of soft liquid crystal elastomer wavy rings under constant thermal and photothermal actuation. The self&#8208;sustained snapping induces continuous ring flipping that drives autonomous dancing or crawling motions on the ground and under water. The three&#8208;dimensional, free&#8208;standing wavy rings employ either a highly symmetric or symmetry&#8208;broken twisted shape with tunable geometric asymmetries. We find that the former favors periodic self&#8208;dancing motion in place due to isotropic friction, while the latter shows a directional crawling motion along the predefined axis of symmetry during fabrication due to asymmetric friction. It shows that the crawling speed can be tuned by the geometric asymmetries with a peak speed achieved at the highest geometric asymmetry. Lastly, we show that the autonomous crawling ring can also adapt its body shape to pass through a confined space that is over 30% narrower than its body size.

Abstract
Driven by the intensive efforts in the development of high&#8208;performance GeTe thermoelectrics for mass&#8208;market application in power generation and refrigeration, GeTe&#8208;based materials display a high figure of merit of &gt; 2.0 and an energy conversion efficiency beyond 10%. However, there still needs a comprehensive review on GeTe, from fundamentals to devices. In this regard, we timely review the latest progress on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art GeTe. We fundamentally analyze the phase transition, intrinsic high carrier concentration, and multiple band edges of GeTe from the perspectives of the native atomic orbital, chemical bonding, and lattice defects. Then, the fabrication methods are summarized with a focus on large&#8208;scale production. Afterward, we comprehensively review the strategies for enhancing electronic transports of GeTe by energy filtering effect, resonance doping, band convergence, and Rashba band splitting, and the methods for strengthening phonon scatterings via nanoprecipitates, planar vacancies, and superlattices. Besides, the device assembly and performance are highlighted. In the end, we conclude and propose future research directions, which will enlighten the development of broader thermoelectric materials.

         <title>Optical Signal Modulation in Photonic Waveguiding Heteroarchitectures with Continuously Variable Visible&#8208;To&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Emission Color</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An input&#8208;to&#8208;output photonic logic gate is fabricated based on supramolecular heterostructures by phosphorescent Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu organometallic complexes. It is based on the optical waveguiding effect and efficient energy transfer among different blocks. The photonic logic gates show high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.








Abstract
Photonic circuit systems based on optical waveguiding heteroarchitectures have attracted considerable interest owing to their potential to overcome the speed limitation in electronic circuits by modulating the optical signal at the micro&#8208; or nanoscale. However, controlling the parameters, including the wavelength and polarization of the light outcoupling, as well as the sequence among different building blocks, remains a key issue. Herein, supramolecular heteroarchitectures made by phosphorescent organometallic complexes of Pt, Pd, Cu, and Au are applied as photonic logic gates that show continuously variable emission colors from 475 to 810&#160;nm, low waveguide losses down to 0.0077&#160;dB&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1, and remarkable excitation&#8208;light polarization&#8208;dependent photoluminescence with anisotropy ratios up to 0.68. The sequences among Pt, Pd, Au, and Cu building blocks in the heteroarchitectures are controlled by living supramolecular polymerization or crystallization&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly synthetic approaches. The results indicate the prospects for using organometallic complexes and supramolecular synthetic approaches to prepare photonic circuit systems with tunable emission color and controllable sequences among different blocks that achieve modulation of the optical signal in the visible&#8208;to&#8208;near&#8208;infrared spectral region.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Inverse Domain Scaling in Polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline ErMnO3 displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO3 and their interaction with elastic strain fields.








Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti&#8208;vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric&#8208;field&#8208;controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far&#8208;reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology&#8208;based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.

         <title>Etching Bulk Covalent Organic Frameworks into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new preparation strategy for nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is reported, and this strategy only needs to slightly extend the commonly used COF preparation process to prepare COF nanoparticles, which is suitable for different types of imine COFs. The nanoscale COF sonosensitizer is applied for enhanced sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. A covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer is developed by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy uses molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch the bulk COF into nanoparticles and has universal applicability to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure can prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endows the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy performance and glutathione consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieves a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;Like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive HCIr nanocluster is reported for triggering effective ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death via triggering GPX4 inhibition and concurrent dual sonodynamic effect by iridium oxide nanoclusters and chlorin e6 (Ce6). These HCIr nanoclusters hold a great promise as a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent for treating intrinsic apoptotic resistance of tumors, and the findings provide a promising strategy for future studies exploring nanoclusters as anticancer agents.








Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations have reported&#160;that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy can overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8211;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters, is developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibits highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound&#160;stimulation, which promotes the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induces ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr can deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8211;Ir (III) transition, which further suppresses the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that HCIr possesses tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhances SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. Thus, an iridium&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent is developed, providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

         <title>Immune Profiling and Multiplexed Label&#8208;Free Detection of 2D MXenes by Mass Cytometry and High&#8208;Dimensional Imaging</title>

&#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED) is a multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy enabling nanomaterial tracking and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. MXenes are designed to be detected within the mass cytometry range. Their detection and quantification are demonstrated in 15 human immune cell subpopulations and in different organs.








Abstract
There is a critical unmet need to detect and image 2D&#160;materials within single cells and tissues while surveying a high degree of information from single cells. Here, a versatile multiplexed label&#8208;free single&#8208;cell detection strategy is proposed based on single&#8208;cell mass cytometry by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (CyTOF) and ion&#8208;beam imaging by time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (MIBI&#8208;TOF). This strategy, &#8220;Label&#8208;free sINgle&#8208;cell tracKing of 2D matErials by mass cytometry and MIBI&#8208;TOF Design&#8221; (LINKED), enables nanomaterial detection and simultaneous measurement of multiple cell and tissue features. As a proof of concept, a set of 2D materials, transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes), is selected to ensure mass detection within the cytometry range while avoiding overlap with more than 70 currently available tags, each able to survey multiple biological parameters. First, their detection and quantification in 15 primary human immune cell subpopulations are demonstrated. Together with the detection, mass cytometry is used to capture several biological aspects of MXenes, such as their biocompatibility and cytokine production after their uptake. Through enzymatic labeling, MXenes&#8217; mediation of cell&#8211;cell interactions is simultaneously evaluated. In vivo biodistribution experiments using a mixture of MXenes in mice confirm the versatility of the detection strategy and reveal MXene accumulation in the liver, blood, spleen, lungs, and relative immune cell subtypes. Finally, MIBI&#8208;TOF is applied to detect MXenes in different organs revealing their spatial distribution. The label&#8208;free detection of 2D materials by mass cytometry at the single&#8208;cell level, on multiple cell subpopulations and in multiple organs simultaneously, will enable exciting new opportunities in biomedicine.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro&#8208;Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) TFT performance can be substantially enhanced by placing aluminum micro&#8208;island arrays (Al&#8208;MIAs) directly on top of the IGZO back channel. The MIA channel coverages/dimensions can be readily optimized by vapor depositing Al through tailored honeycomb cinnamate&#8208;cellulose film shadow masks, demonstrating the great versatility of this route to enhance metal oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor performance.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here, a new strategy is reported to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#181;e) increases from &#8776;3.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 to near 15.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25 &#181;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and technology computer&#8208;aided design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#181;e of &gt;50.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 . This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicrometer resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long&#8208;sought&#8208;after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

         <title>Ethylene&#8208;Carbonate&#8208;Free Electrolytes for Rechargeable Li&#8208;Ion Pouch Cells at Sub&#8208;Freezing Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of ethylene carbonate (EC)&#8208;free electrolytes, based on methyl acetate and fluorinated ethers, is proposed for Li&#8208;ion batteries operating at sub&#8208;freezing temperatures. The EC&#8208;free electrolyte demonstrates all&#8208;round performance advantages over the traditional EC&#8208;based electrolyte and presents a viable solution to improve the capacity retention and rechargeability of metal&#8208;ion batteries in cold climates.








Abstract
Sub&#8208;freezing temperature presents a significant challenge to the survival of current Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) as it leads to low capacity retention and poor cell rechargeability. The electrolyte in commercial LIBs relies too heavily on ethylene carbonate (EC) to produce a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) on graphite (Gr) anodes, but its high melting point (36.4&#160;&#176;C) severely restricts ion transport below 0&#160;&#176;C, causing energy loss and Li plating. Here, a class of EC&#8208;free electrolytes that exhibits remarkable low&#8208;temperature performance without compromising cell lifespan is reported. It is found that at sub&#8208;zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC&#8208;free electrolytes create a highly stable, low&#8208;impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch&#8208;type LiCoO2 (LCO)|Gr cells with EC&#8208;free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi0.85Co0.10Al0.05O2 (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best&#8208;performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC&#8208;free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room&#8208;temperature capacity, outperforming EC&#8208;based electrolytes.

It is found that at sub-zero temperatures, EC forms highly resistive SEI that seriously impedes electrode kinetics, whereas EC-free electrolytes create a highly stable, low-impedance SEI through anion decomposition, which boosts capacity retention and eliminates Li plating during charging. Pouch-type LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (LCO)|Gr cells with EC-free electrolytes sustain 900 cycles at 25&#160;&#176;C with 1 C charge/discharge, and LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.85&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.10&lt;/sub&gt;Al&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (NCA)|Gr cells last 300 cycles at &#8722;15&#160;&#176;C with 0.3&#160;C charge, both among the best-performing in the literature under comparable conditions. Even at &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C, the NCA|Gr cell with EC-free electrolytes still delivers 76% of its room-temperature capacity, outperforming EC-based electrolytes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reliable spintronic physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are demonstrated by exploiting field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. The stochastic switching polarity of the top CoFeB is achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.








Abstract
Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

         <title>Filamented Light (FLight) Biofabrication of Highly Aligned Tissue&#8208;Engineered Constructs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication is a new technology for the rapid biofabrication of highly aligned tissue&#8208;engineered constructs, like muscle and tendon. The filamentation of a light beam into a cell&#8208;laden photoresin results in a material composed of micrometer&#8208;scale hydrogel filaments acting as cell guiding cues. Cell migration into ultrahigh aspect ratio (&gt;700:1) voids induces alignment of cells and deposition of extracellular matrix.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;laden hydrogels used in tissue engineering generally lack sufficient 3D&#160;topographical guidance for cells to mature into aligned tissues. A new strategy called filamented light (FLight) biofabrication rapidly creates hydrogels composed of unidirectional microfilament networks, with diameters on the length scale of single cells. Due to optical modulation instability, a light beam is divided optically into FLight beams. Local polymerization of a photoactive resin is triggered, leading to local increase in refractive index, which itself creates self&#8208;focusing waveguides and further polymerization of photoresin into long hydrogel microfilaments. Diameter and spacing of the microfilaments can be tuned from 2 to 30&#160;&#181;m by changing the coherence length of the light beam. Microfilaments show outstanding cell instructive properties with fibroblasts, tenocytes, endothelial cells, and myoblasts, influencing cell alignment, nuclear deformation, and extracellular matrix deposition. FLight is compatible with multiple types of photoresins and allows for biofabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale hydrogel constructs with excellent cell viability within seconds (&lt;10 s per construct). Multidirectional microfilaments are achievable within a single hydrogel construct by changing the direction of FLight projection, and complex multimaterial/multicellular tissue&#8208;engineered constructs are possible by sequentially exchanging the cell&#8208;laden photoresin. FLight offers a transformational approach to developing anisotropic tissues using photo&#8208;crosslinkable biomaterials.

         <title>Efficient Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Based on Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient In(Zn)As&#8211;In(Zn)P&#8211;GaP&#8211;ZnS colloidal quantum dot (CQD) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) that operate with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 13.3% at 1006 nm are reported. The implementation of a thin hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer at the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device gives rise to improved charge balance and luminescence efficiencies.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) light emission is important for a diverse range of modern applications, such as eye&#8208;safe depth sensing, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), facial recognition, eye tracking, optical communication, and health&#8208;monitoring technologies. However, there are a very limited number of known semiconductors that can emit efficiently in the SWIR spectral range. Presently, SWIR light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on colloidal quantum dots (CQD) are dominated by lead chalcogenide systems, despite the presence of heavy metal and modest efficiencies. Here, a highly efficient SWIR LED based on heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free indium arsenide (InAs) core&#8211;shell CQDs is presented. In the LED design, the implementation of an otherwise hole&#8208;transporting poly(vinylcarbazole) (PVK) layer on the electron&#8208;injecting side of the device stack leads to a surprising enhancement in device performance, giving remarkably high external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of 13.3% at 1006 nm. Single&#8208;carrier device and optical investigations reveal the origins of enhancement to be the electronic decoupling of the CQD layer with the electron&#8208;injecting zinc oxide (ZnO) layer, which mitigates luminescence quenching and improves charge balance. This work marks one of the highest efficiencies reported for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed LEDs in the SWIR spectral region, and can find significant applications in emerging consumer electronic technologies.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be intercalated into the Al&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;MnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#183;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum-ion batteries (AAIBs).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are combined with probiotic extracts to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles, which are used to construct a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) to meet different conditions. The DMAH can treat bacterial wounds through phage&#8208;like therapy in the dark. Meanwhile, DMAH can perform rapid disinfection through the synergistic photothermal/NO therapy under near&#8208;infrared light to cure infected wounds.








Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through nonantibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) is combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tailspike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiates the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results reveal that the DMAH achieves a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected to 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation release NO, which, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damages bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multifunctional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

         <title>Weakening the Solvating Power of Solvents to Encapsulate Lithium Polysulfides Enables Long&#8208;Cycling Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large steric hindrance of its fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing &#63743;CF2&#63743; segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power and high reduction stability. The weakening solvating power of fluorohydrocarbon solvent leads the formation of encapsulating&#8208;lithium polysulfide electrolyte for lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cells with long cycling lifespan.








Abstract
Long cycling lifespan is a prerequisite for practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries yet is restricted by side reactions between soluble polysulfides and the lithium&#8208;metal anode. The regulation on solvation structure of polysulfides renders encapsulating polysulfides electrolytes (EPSE) as a promising solution to suppress the parasitic reactions. The solvating power of the solvents in the outer solvent shell of lithium polysulfides is critical for the encapsulation effect of EPSE. Herein, 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether&#160;(HFE) is demonstrated as a superior outer&#8208;shell solvent to construct EPSE. Based on the&#160;large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains, the electron&#8208;withdrawing perfluoro segment (&#63743;CF2&#63743; further endows HFE with prominently weak solvating power. The HFE&#8208;EPSE improves the lifespan from 54 to 135 cycles for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries with an ultrathin lithium&#8208;metal anode (50&#160;&#181;m) and high&#8208;areal&#8208;loading sulfur cathode (4.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). Furthermore, a 334&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 lithium&#8211;sulfur pouch cell (2.4 Ah level) with HFE&#8208;EPSE stably undergoes 25 cycles. This work demonstrates the role of weakening solvating power of outer&#8208;shell solvents to construct superior EPSE and inspires the significance of the solvation chemistry of polysulfides to achieve practical lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Construction of Active Protein Materials: Manipulation on Morphology of Salmon Calcitonin Assemblies with Enhanced Bone Regeneration Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy to improve the relatively low stability and fast degradation of protein drugs is proposed. &#8220;Active protein materials&#8221; can be constructed by regulating the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug itself via a small&#8208;molecular regulator, that is, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial.








Abstract
The effect of protein drugs is always limited by their relatively low stability and fast degradation property; thus, various elegant efforts have been made to improve the bioactivity and biocompatibility of the protein drugs. Here, an alternative way is proposed to solve this problem. By simply adding a limited amount of small&#8208;molecular regulator, which tunes the subtle balance of protein&#8211;protein interactions (PPIs) and disulfide bond formation, the self&#8208;assembly property of the protein drug can be regulated, forming an &#8220;active protein material&#8221; itself. This means that, the resulting biomaterial is dominated by the protein drug and water, with significantly enhanced bone regeneration effect compared to the virgin protein in vitro and in vivo, through multivalent effect between the protein and receptor and the retarded degradation of the assembled proteins. In this active protein material, the protein drug is not only the active drug, but also the drug carrier, which greatly increases the drug&#8208;loading efficiency of the biomaterial, indicating the advantages of the easy preparation, high efficiency, and low cost of the active protein material with a bright future in biomedical applications.

An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

         <title>Polarization Topology at the Nominally Charged Domain Walls in Uniaxial Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization domains in uniaxial ferroelectrics acquire a remarkable topological configuration of branching and crisscrossing domains. The domains are separated by the united domain wall spreading all over the sample and containing saddle&#8208;like singular nodes.








Abstract
Ferroelectric domain walls provide a fertile environment for novel materials physics. If a polarization discontinuity arises, it can drive a redistribution of electronic carriers and changes in band structure, which often result in emergent 2D conductivity. If such a discontinuity is not tolerated, then its amelioration usually involves the formation of complex topological patterns, such as flux&#8208;closure domains, dipolar vortices, skyrmions, merons, or Hopfions. The degrees of freedom required for the development of such patterns, in which dipolar rotation is a hallmark, are readily found in multiaxial ferroelectrics. In uniaxial ferroelectrics, where only two opposite polar orientations are possible, it has been assumed that discontinuities are unavoidable when antiparallel components of polarization meet. This perception has been borne out by the appearance of charged conducting domain walls in systems such as hexagonal manganites and lithium niobate. Here, experimental and theoretical investigations on lead germanate (Pb5Ge3O11) reveal that polar discontinuities can be obviated at head&#8208;to&#8208;head and tail&#8208;to&#8208;tail domain walls by mutual domain bifurcation along two different axes, creating a characteristic saddle&#8208;point domain wall morphology and associated novel dipolar topology, removing the need for screening charge accumulation and associated conductivity enhancement.

         <title>A Versatile Molten&#8208;Salt Induction Strategy to Achieve Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage &gt;1.2 V</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature molten salt dimethylamine acetate is developed as the solvent for precursor solutions, which also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film. Consequently, 1.25 V of the open&#8208;circuit voltage and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells reported so far.








Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 perovskite has emerged as an important photovoltaic material due to its high thermal stability and suitable bandgap for tandem devices. Currently, the cell performance of CsPbI3 solar cells is mainly subject to a large open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) deficit. Herein, a multifunctional room&#8208;temperature molten salt, dimethylamine acetate (DMAAc) is demonstrated, which not only directly acts as a solvent for precursor solutions, but also regulates the phase conversion process of the CsPbI3 film for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics. DMAAc can stabilize the DMAPbI3 structure and eliminate the Cs4PbI6 intermediate phase, which is easily spatially segregated. Meanwhile, a new homogeneous intermediate phase DMAPb(I,Ac)3 is formed, which finally affords high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films. With this approach, the charge capture activity of defects in the CsPbI3 film is significantly suppressed. Consequently, a VOC of 1.25&#160;V and &gt;21% power conversion efficiency are achieved, which is the record highest reported thus far. This intermediate phase&#8208;regulation strategy is believed to be applicable to other perovskite material systems.

         <title>Understanding H2 Evolution Electrochemistry to Minimize Solvated Water Impact on Zinc&#8208;Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, and it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode.








Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn&#8208;metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and, using a glycine additive to reduce solvated water, it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. This electrolyte additive is evidenced to suppress H2 evolution, reduce corrosion, and give a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells. It is demonstrated that Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8211;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte. It is concluded that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIBs for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Multiphase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency, Thick&#8208;Film, and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

Biofabrication
In article number 2204301, Marcy Zenobi&#8208;Wong and co&#8208;workers use Filamented Light (FLight) biofabrication to create hydrogel constructs containing ultrahigh&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio microfilaments. FLight biofabrication is both fast and biocompatible. Microfilaments and associated microchannels provide effective topological guidance cues to instruct cell migration, alignment, and extracellular matrix deposition of resident cells.

Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries
In article number 2205284, Xue&#8208;Qiang Zhang, Qiang Zhang, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that by weakening the solvating power of the solvents, lithium polysulfides can be encapsulated to inhibit the parasitic reactions on lithium&#8208;metal anodes. The large steric hindrance of the fluorohydrocarbon chains and the electron&#8208;withdrawing&#8211;CF2&#8211;segments endow 1,1,2,2&#8208;tetrafluoroethyl&#8208;2,2,3,3&#8208;tetrafluoropropyl ether with prominently weak solvating power, similar to a submarine, to tightly encapsulate lithium polysulfides and achieve long&#8208;cycling lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

Magnetic Ordering
In article number 2206161, Jason D. Azoulay and co&#8208;workers demonstrate that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a solution&#8208;processed high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide robust spin&#8208;centers, intermolecular ferromagnetic exchange interactions, and anisotropic spin ordering. This new approach toward practically applicable metal&#8208;free magnetism opens new opportunities for emerging technologies that integrate spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects and operate at room temperature.

Photonic Logic Gates
In article number 2204839, Chi&#8208;Ming Che and co&#8208;workers describe a photonic logic gate device based on supramolecular heterostructures made by phosphorescent Au, Cu, Pt, and Pd complexes. The photonic logic gate operation is realized by an optical waveguiding effect and energy transfer among the different building blocks. These photonic logic gates have high emission anisotropy, low optical waveguiding loss, and continuously varied emission colors ranging from blue to near&#8208;infrared spectral regions.

         <title>Recent Progress of Metal Sulfide Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging unique properties of metal sulfide photocatalysts, including abundant active sites, light&#8208;harvesting ability, and expedited charge separation, endow them promising candidates for solar light conversion. This review aims to offer a full&#8208;scale lens to discuss the recent advances of metal sulfides photocatalysts, propose their challenges, and envision the prospects of the development of metal sulfides for photocatalytic redox reactions.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical cycles enable an entire environment to operate in a more complex, yet effective, way to perform natural photosynthesis. However, such artificial systems suffer from a lack of well&#8208;established photocatalysts with the ability to harvest the solar spectrum and rich catalytic active&#8208;site density. Benefiting from extensive experimental and theoretical investigations, this bottleneck may be overcome by devising a photocatalytic platform based on metal sulfides with predominant electronic, physical, and chemical properties. These tunable properties can endow them with abundant active sites, favorable light utilization, and expedited charge transportation for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion. Here, it is described how some vital lessons extracted from previous investigations are employed to promote the further development of metal sulfides for artificial photosynthesis, including water splitting, CO2 reduction, N2 reduction, and pollutant removal. Their functions, properties, synthetic strategies, emerging issues, design principles, and intrinsic functional mechanisms for photocatalytic redox reactions are discussed in detail. Finally, the associated challenges and prospects for the utilization of metal sulfides are highlighted and future development trends in photocatalysis are envisioned.

         <title>Organic Neuroelectronics: From Neural Interfaces to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 45, November 10, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next-generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with a Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing robust and multifunctional kirigami electronics for wearable applications imposes strict restrictions on the constituent materials. In this work, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto the CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of physiological parameters.








Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on the 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations are conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of the&#160;CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provide essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto a CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin&#8208;temperature measurements, and measurement of other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices can shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>A Perovskite Photodetector Crossbar Array by Vapor Deposition for Dynamic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by vapor deposition method is presented, which shows a large rectification ratio and suppresses electrical crosstalk in the imaging array. Its fast response time allows smooth&#160;real&#8208;time image acquisition. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range and is sensitive to weak light.








Abstract
With the development of perovskite photodetectors, integrating photodetectors into array image sensors is the next target to pursue. The major obstacle to integrating perovskite photodiodes for dynamic imaging is the optoelectrical crosstalk among the pixels. Herein, a perovskite photodiode&#8211;blocking diode (PIN&#8208;BD) crossbar array with pixel&#8208;wise rectifying property by the vapor deposition method is presented. The PIN&#8208;BD shows a large rectification ratio of 3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;102 under illumination, suppressing electrical crosstalk to as small as 8.0% in the imaging array. The fast response time of 72.8&#160;ns allows real&#8208;time image acquisition by over 25 frames per second. The imaging sensor exhibits excellent imaging capability with a large linear dynamic range of 112&#160;dB with 4096 gray levels and weak light sensitivity under 1.2&#160;lux.

         <title>ECRAM Materials, Devices, Circuits and Architectures: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike two&#8208;terminal memristors, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) tunes conductance through ion injection into the channel through a solid&#8208;state electrolyte. The history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the challenging fundamental questions, and how ECRAM could be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low power neuromorphic computing are reviewed.








Abstract
Non&#8208;von&#8208;Neumann computing using neuromorphic systems based on two&#8208;terminal resistive nonvolatile memory elements has emerged as a promising approach, but its full potential has not been realized due to the lack of materials and devices with the appropriate attributes. Unlike memristors, which require large write currents to drive phase transformations or filament growth, electrochemical random access memory (ECRAM) decouples the &#8220;write&#8221; and &#8220;read&#8221; operations using a &#8220;gate&#8221; electrode to tune the conductance state through charge&#8208;transfer reactions, and every electron transferred through the external circuit in ECRAM corresponds to the migration of &#8776;1 ion used to store analogue information. Like static dopants in traditional semiconductors, electrochemically inserted ions modulate the conductivity by locally perturbing a host's electronic structure; however, ECRAM does so in a dynamic and reversible manner. The resulting change in conductance can span orders of magnitude, from gradual increments needed for analog elements, to large, abrupt changes for dynamically reconfigurable adaptive architectures. In this in&#8208;depth perspective, the history of ECRAM, the recent progress in devices spanning organic, inorganic, and 2D materials, circuits, architectures, the rich portfolio of challenging, fundamental questions, and how ECRAM can be harnessed to realize a new paradigm for low&#8208;power neuromorphic computing are discussed.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Microneedle Patches with Ultrafast Dissolution and Rapid&#8208;Onset Capabilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches composed of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives demonstrate strong and tough mechanical properties by virtue of multiple supramolecular interactions, surpassing that of most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMN patches. CD DMN can load hydrophilic and hydrophobic drugs, and dissolve extremely fast to achieve a rapid onset of its payloads, which is unachievable with conventional polymeric DMN patches.








Abstract
Dissolving microneedle (DMN) patches are emerging as a minimally invasive and efficient transdermal drug delivery platform. Generally, noncrystalline, water&#8208;soluble, and high&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight polymers are employed in DMNs because their sufficient intermolecular interactions can endow the DMNs with necessary mechanical strength and toughness. However, high viscosity and heavy chain entanglement of polymer solutions greatly hinder processing and dissolution of polymeric DMNs. Here, a strong and tough supramolecular DMN patch made of highly water&#8208;soluble cyclodextrin (CD) derivatives is described. Due to the synergy of multiple supramolecular interactions, the CD DMN patch exhibits robust mechanical strength outperforming the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polymeric DMNs. The CD DMN displays ultrafast dissolution (&lt;30 s) in skin models by virtue of the dynamic and weak noncovalent bonds, which also enables the CD DMN and its payloads to diffuse rapidly into the deep skin layer. Moreover, the unique supramolecular structure of CD allows the CD DMNs to load not only hydrophilic drugs (e.g., rhodamine B as a model) but also hydrophobic model drugs (e.g., ibuprofen). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, CD DMNs loading ibuprofen show a rapid onset of therapeutic action in a xylene&#8208;induced acute inflammation model in mice. This work opens a new avenue for the development of mechanically robust supramolecular DMNs and broadens the applications of supramolecular materials.

         <title>Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via a Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Hydrazine Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine battery is proposed for separate and efficient hydrogen generation by temporally decoupled hydrazine splitting. The battery, realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst, decouples the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;)\[(1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4} + 2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^ - } \to 1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2} + 2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}} + 2{e^ - })\], which achieves separate hydrogen generation, ansimultaneously efficient hydrogen production with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96%.








Abstract
Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large&#8208;scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine (Zn&#8211;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H2O + 2e&#8722;&#160;&#8594; H2&#160;+ 2OH&#8722;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;$1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4}{\bm{ + }}2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^{\bm{ - }}}{\bm{ \to }}1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{\bm{ + }}2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}}{\bm{ + }}2{e^{\bm{ - }}}$). This Zn&#8211;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on the cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of 3D Mo2C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8211;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with a low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ&#160;mol&#8722;1) and high energy efficiency of 96%.

     alt="Decoupled Electrochemical Hydrazine &#8220;Splitting&#8221; via a Rechargeable Zn&#8211;Hydrazine Battery"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine battery is proposed for separate and efficient hydrogen generation by temporally decoupled hydrazine splitting. The battery, realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst, decouples the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution (2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#8594; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+ 2OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydrazine oxidation (1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;)\[(1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4} + 2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^ - } \to 1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2} + 2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}} + 2{e^ - })\], which achieves separate hydrogen generation, ansimultaneously efficient hydrogen production with low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V and ultrahigh energy efficiency of 96%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hydrogen generation via electrochemical splitting plays an important role to achieve hydrogen economy. However, the large-scale application is highly limited by high cost and low efficiency. Herein, a new type of rechargeable Zn&#8211;hydrazine (Zn&#8211;Hz) battery is proposed and realized by a bifunctional electrocatalyst based on two separate cathodic reactions of hydrogen evolution (discharge: 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2&lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;&#8594; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+ 2OH&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydrazine oxidation (charge: 1/2&#8201;N2H4+2OH&#8722;&#8594;1/2&#8201;N2+2H2O+2e&#8722;$1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{{\rm{H}}_4}{\bm{ + }}2{\rm{O}}{{\rm{H}}^{\bm{ - }}}{\bm{ \to }}1{\rm{/}}2\,{{\rm{N}}_2}{\bm{ + }}2{{\rm{H}}_2}{\rm{O}}{\bm{ + }}2{e^{\bm{ - }}}$). This Zn&#8211;Hz battery, driven by temporally decoupled electrochemical hydrazine splitting on the cathode during discharge and charge processes, can generate separated hydrogen without purification. When the highly active bifunctional cathode of 3D Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C/Ni@C/CS is paired with Zn foil, the Zn&#8211;Hz battery can achieve efficient hydrogen generation with a low energy input of less than 0.4&#160;V (77.2&#160;kJ&#160;mol&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high energy efficiency of 96%. Remarkably, this battery exhibits outstanding long-term stability for 600 cycles (200&#160;h), achieving continuous hydrogen production on demand, which presents great potential for practical application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Synergistic Effect of Cation Composition Engineering of Hybrid cs1&#8722;xFAxPbBr3 Nanocrystals For Self&#8208;Healing Electronics Application</title>

Abstract
Mixed&#8208;cation hybrid perovskite nanocrystal (HPNC) with high crystallinity, color purity, and tunable optical band gap offers a practical pathway toward next&#8208;generation displays. Herein, we present a two&#8208;step modified hot&#8208;injection combined with cation compositional engineering and surface treatment to synthesize high&#8208;purity Cs1&#8208;xFAxPbBr3 HPNCs. The optimized Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 light&#8208;emitting devices (LEDs) exhibit uniform luminescence of 3500&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a prominent current efficiency of 21.5&#160;cd A&#8722;1. As a proof of concept, a self&#8208;healing polymer (SHP) integrated with white LED backlight and laser prototypes exhibited 4&#8208;hours autonomous self&#8208;healing through the synergistic effect of weak reversible imine bonds and stronger H&#8208;bonds. First, the SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;initial and SHP&#8208;HPNCs&#8208;cut possess high long&#8208;term stability and dramatically suppressed Pb leakage as low as 0.6&#160;ppm along with a low leakage rate of 1.11 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 and 3.36 &#215; 10&#8722;5 cm2 even over 6 months in water. Second, the Cs0.5FA0.5PbBr3 HPNCs and SHP&#8208;induced shattered&#8208;repaired perovskite glass substrate show the lowest lasing threshold value of 1.24 &#956;J cm&#8722;2 and 8.58 &#956;J cm&#8722;2, respectively. This work provides an integrative and in&#8208;depth approach to exploiting SHP with intrinsic and entropic self&#8208;healing capabilities combined with HPNCs to develop robust and reliable soft&#8208;electronic backlight and laser applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh strain&#8208;insensitive integrated hybrid electronics using highly stretchable bilayer liquid metal based conductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Human&#8208;interfaced electronic systems require strain&#8208;resilient circuits. However, present integrated stretchable electronics easily suffer from electrical deterioration and face challenges in forming robust multilayered soft&#8208;rigid hybrid configurations. Here, we introduce a bilayer liquid&#8208;solid conductor (b&#8208;LSC) with amphiphilic properties to reliably interface with both rigid electronics and elastomeric substrates. The top liquid metal can self&#8208;solder its interface with rigid electronics at a resistance 30% lower than the traditional tin&#8208;soldered rigid interface. The bottom polar composite comprising liquid metal particles and polymers can not only reliably interface with elastomers but also help the b&#8208;LSC heal after breakage. The b&#8208;LSC can be scalably fabricated by printing and subsequent peeling strategies, showing ultra&#8208;high strain&#8208;insensitive conductivity (maximum 22,532 S/cm), extreme stretchability (2,260%), and negligible resistance change under ultra&#8208;high strain (0.34 times increase under 1,000% strain). It can act as stretchable vertical interconnect access for connecting multilayered layouts and can be scalably and universally fabricated on various substrates with a resolution of &#8764; 200&#160;&#956;m. We demonstrate it can construct stretchable sensor arrays, multi&#8208;layered stretchable displays, highly integrated haptic user&#8208;interactive optoelectric E&#8208;skins, visualized heaters, robot touch sensing systems, and wireless powering for wearable electronics.

         <title>Chemical tuning Meets Two&#8208;Dimensional Molecular Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) magnets provoke a surge of interest in large anisotropy in reduced dimensions and are promising for next&#8208;generation information technology where dynamic magnetic tuning is essential. Until recently, the crucial metal&#8208;organic magnet Cr(pyz)2&#8901;xLiCl&#8901;yTHF with considerable high coercivity and high&#8208;temperature magnetic order opens up a new platform to control magnetism in metal&#8208;organic materials at room temperature. Here we report an in&#8208;situ chemical tuning route to realize the controllable transformation of low&#8208;temperature magnetic order into room&#8208;temperature hard magnetism in Cr(pyz)2&#8901;xLiCl&#8901;yTHF. The chemical tuning via electrochemical lithiation and solvation/desolvation exhibits continuously variable magnetic features from cryogenic magnetism to the room&#8208;temperature optimum performance of coercivity (Hc) of 8500&#160;Oe and energy product of 0.6 MGOe. Such chemically flexible tunability of room&#8208;temperature magnetism is ascribed to the different degrees of lithiation and solvation that modify the stoichiometry and Cr&#8208;pyrazine coordination framework. Furthermore, the additively manufactured hybrid magnets show air stability and electromagnetic induction, providing potential applications. The findings here suggest chemical tuning as a universal approach to control the anisotropy and magnetism of 2D hybrid magnets at room temperature, promising for data storage, magnetic refrigeration, and spintronics.

         <title>Lactate Oxidase&#8208;Instructed Cancer Diagnosis and Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lactate oxidase (LOx) has attracted extensive interest in cancer diagnosis and therapy in recent years owing to its specific catalysis on L&#8208;lactate, its catalytic process consumes oxygen (O2) and generates a large amount of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and pyruvate. Given high levels of lactate in tumor tissues and its tight correlation with tumor growth, metastasis, and recurrence, LOx&#8208;based biosensors including H2O2&#8208;based, O2&#8208;based, pH&#8208;sensitive, and electrochemical have been designed for cancer diagnosis, and various LOx&#8208;based cancer therapy strategies including lactate depletion based metabolic cancer therapy/immunotherapy, hypoxia activated chemotherapy, H2O2 based chemodynamic therapy, and multimodal synergistic cancer therapy have also been developed. In this review, the lactate&#8208;specific catalytic properties of LOx are introduced, and the recent advances on LOx&#8208;instructed cancer diagnostic or therapeutic platforms and corresponding biological applications are summarized. Additionally, the challenges and potential of LOx&#8208;based nanomedicines are highlighted.

         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a novel &#960;&#8208;conjugated N&#8208;heteroaromatic hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) material is reported, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries is demonstrated. The enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability and long cycling life.








Abstract
Electroactive organic materials with tailored functional groups are of great importance for aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries due to their green and renewable nature. Herein, a completely new N&#8208;heteroaromatic material, hexaazatrinaphthalene&#8208;phenazine (HATN&#8208;PNZ) is designed and synthesized, by an acid&#8208;catalyzed condensation reaction, and its use as an ultrahigh performance cathode for Zn&#8208;ion batteries demonstrated. Compared with phenazine monomer, it is revealed that the &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure of N&#8208;heteroaromatics can effectively increase electron delocalization, thereby improving its electrical conductivity. Furthermore, the enlarged aromatic structure noticeably suppresses its dissolution in aqueous electrolytes, thus enabling high structural stability. As expected, the HATN&#8208;PNZ cathode delivers a large reversible capacity of 257&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, ultrahigh rate capability of 144&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 100&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and an extremely long cycle life of 45&#160;000 cycles at 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Investigation of the charge&#8208;storage mechanism demonstrates the synergistic coordination of both Zn2+ and H+ cations with the phenanthroline groups, with Zn2+ first followed by H+, accompanying the reversible formation of zinc hydroxide sulfate hydrate. This work provides a molecular&#8208;engineering strategy for superior organic materials and adds new insights to understand the charge&#8208;storage behavior of aqueous Zn&#8211;organic batteries.

         <title>Wet&#8208;Adhesive On&#8208;Skin Sensors Based on Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Wireless Monitoring of Metabolites in Sweat</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials and techniques are demonstrated to achieve wearable and breathable sensing devices by integrating conductive metal&#8211;organic frameworks with a flexible nanocellulose membrane. This robust sensor can self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin for the wireless and in situ monitoring of vitamin C in human sweat.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with well&#8208;defined porous structures and tailored functionalities have been widely used in chemical sensing. However, the integration of MOFs with flexible electronic devices for wearable sensing is challenging because of their low electrical conductivity and fragile mechanical properties. Herein, a wearable sweat sensor for metabolite detection is presented by integrating an electrically conductive Ni&#8208;MOF with a flexible nanocellulose substrate. The MOF&#8208;based layered film sensor with inherent conductivity, highly porous structure, and active catalytic properties enables the selective and accurate detection of vitamin C and uric acid. More importantly, the lightweight sensor can conformably self&#8208;adhere to sweaty skin and exhibits high water&#8208;vapor permeability. Furthermore, a wireless epidermal nutrition tracking system for the in situ monitoring of the dynamics of sweat vitamin C is demonstrated, the results of which are comparable to those tested by high&#8208;performance liquid chromatography. This study opens a new avenue for integrating MOFs as the active layer in wearable electronic devices and holds promise for the future development of high&#8208;performance electronics with enhanced sensing, energy production, and catalytic capabilities through the implementation of multifunctional MOFs.

         <title>Morphology&#8208;Control Growth of Graphene Islands by Nonlinear Carbon Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy for synthesizing hexagonal graphene with specific sizes is presented. The dynamic adjustment of the carbon supply and precise control of the growth and etching processes result in the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based tunnel&#8208;junction structures and small&#8208;gapped quasi&#8208;monolayer films. This study provides a foundation for directly synthesizing 2D materials for applications in highly integrated electronics.








Abstract
Controlling the morphology of graphene and other 2D materials in chemical vapor deposition (CVD) growth is crucial because the morphology reflects the crystal quality of as&#8208;synthesized nanomaterials in a certain way, and consequently it indirectly represents the physical properties of 2D materials such as bandgap, selective ion transportation, and impermeability. However, precise control of the morphology is limited by the complex formation mechanism and sensitive growth&#8208;environment factors of graphene. Therefore, the CVD synthesis of single&#8208;crystal hexagonal&#8208;shaped graphene islands with specific sizes is challenging. Herein, an unconventional nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is proposed to realize controllable CVD growth of desired hexagonal graphene islands with specific sizes on Cu substrates. Large&#8208;area graphene films of isolated islands with desired densities, sizes, and distances between the islands are&#160;successfully synthesized. Subsequently, the direct growth of a planar&#8208;tunnel&#8208;junction structure based on two parallel gapped graphene islands is&#160;achieved by specific adjustment of the growth and etching processes of graphene CVD synthesis. It is therefore demonstrated that the nonlinear&#8208;carbon&#8208;supply growth strategy is a reliable method for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality graphene and can facilitate the direct growth of graphene&#8208;based nanodevices in the future.

         <title>Multifunctionality of Li2SrNb2O7: Memristivity, Tunable Rectification, Ferroelasticity, and Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered perovskite Li2SrNb2O7&#160;bulk single crystals are synthesized. At room temperature, Li ions show significant intralayer activities, which creates a giant memristivity and a rectification effect combining with a relaxation upon time. At low temperature, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectricity and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectricity develop, and the rectification state becomes robust. The results demonstrate a selectively controlling of the ferroic orders and ionic migration.








Abstract
Layered Li2SrNb2O7, an inorganic oxide in its bulk single&#8208;crystalline form, is experimentally demonstrated to exhibit multiple structural facets such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and antiferroelectricity. The transition from a room temperature (RT) centrosymmetric structure to a low&#8208;temperature out&#8208;of&#8208;plane ferroelectric and in&#8208;plane antiferroelectric structure and the low&#8208;temperature (LT) ferroelectric domain configuration are unveiled in TEM, piezoresponse force microscopy, and polarization loop studies. Li2SrNb2O7&#160;also exhibits highly tunable ferroelasticity and excellent Li+ in&#8208;plane conduction, which leads to a giant in&#8208;plane memristor behavior and an in&#8208;plane electronic conductivity increase by three orders of magnitude by electric poling at room RT). The accumulation of Li+ vacancies at the crystal&#8211;electrode interface is visualized using in&#160;situ optical microscopy. The Li&#8208;ionic biased state shows a clear in&#8208;plane rectification effect combined with a significant relaxation upon time at RT. Relaxation can be fully suppressed at LTs such as 200&#160;K, and utilizing an electric field cooling, a stable rectification can be achieved at 200&#160;K. The results shed light on the selective control of multifunctionalities such as ferroelasticity, ferroelectricity, and ionic&#8208;migration&#8208;mediated effects (a memristor effect and rectification) in a single&#8208;phase bulk material utilizing, for example, different directions, temperatures, frequencies, and magnitudes of electric field.

         <title>Janus Helical Ribbon Structure of Ordered Nanowire Films for Flexible Solar Thermoelectric Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>

Abstract
Solar thermoelectric devices play a significant role in addressing the problem of global warming, owing to their unique features of converting both waste heat and solar energy directly into electricity. Herein, a flexible 3D Janus helical ribbon architecture is designed, starting from well&#8208;aligned tellurium (Te) nanowire film, using an in situ redox process reacting with Ag+ and Cu2+ resulting in n&#8208;type, p&#8208;type, and photothermal sides in one film. Remarkably, the device shows all&#8208;day electricity generation and large temperature gradient by coupling the cold side with a passive radiative cooling technique and the hot side with a selective solar absorption technique, showing a temperature gradient of 29.5 K, which is much higher than previously reported devices under a low solar radiation of only 614 W m&#8722;2. Especially, the device can still generate electricity even at night. The present strategy offers a new way for heat management by efficiently utilizing solar energy and the cold of the universe.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Socketed Sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Copper for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction to C2+</title>

         <dc:description>
Constructing perovskite&#8211;Cu heteronanostructures through in situ socketing sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu onto perovskite backbones provides a favorable platform for efficient and stable CO2 electroreduction (CER) to C2+ products. Within such heteronanostructures, the significant strong metal&#8211;support interactions, which modulate electronic structure of active Cu and strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion, play key roles in simultaneously enhancing CER activity, selectivity for C2+ products, and stability.








Abstract
In situ socketing metal nanoparticles onto perovskite oxides has shown great potential in heterogeneous catalysis, but its employment in boosting ambient CO2 electroreduction (CER) is unexplored. Here, a CER catalyst of perovskite&#8208;socketed sub&#8208;3&#160;nm Cu equipped with strong metal&#8211;support interactions (SMSIs) is constructed to promote efficient and stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion. For such a catalyst, plentiful sub&#8208;3&#160;nm ellipsoid Cu particles are homogeneously and epitaxially anchored on the perovskite backbones, with concomitant creation of significant SMSIs. These SMSIs are able to not only modulate electronic structure of active Cu and facilitate adsorption/activation of key intermediates, but also to strengthen perovskite&#8211;Cu adhesion and intensify resistance to structural degradation. Beneficial from these advantageous merits, when evaluated in CER, it performs comparably to or better than most reported Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures. Relative to a physical&#8208;mixture counterpart, it features marked improvements (up to 6.2 folds) in activity and selectivity for C2+, together with greatly boosted stability (&gt;80&#160;h). This work gives a new avenue to rationally design more advanced Cu&#8208;based heteronanostructures for CER.

         <title>Continuous Color&#8208;Tunable Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Compositionally Graded Monolayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;alloy&#8208;based broadband optoelectronic device applications.








Abstract
The diverse series of transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials has been employed in various optoelectronic applications, such as photodetectors, light&#8208;emitting diodes, and lasers. Typically, the detection or emission range of optoelectronic devices is unique to the bandgap of the active material. Therefore, to improve the capability of these devices, extensive efforts have been devoted to tune the bandgap, such as gating, strain, and dielectric engineering. However, the controllability of these methods is severely limited (typically &#8776;0.1&#160;eV). In contrast, alloying TMDCs is an effective approach that yields a composition&#8208;dependent bandgap and enables light emissions over a wide range. In this study, a color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device using compositionally graded TMDC alloys is fabricated. The monolayer WS2/WSe2 alloy grown by chemical vapor deposition shows a spatial gradient in the light&#8208;emission energy, which varies from 2.1 to 1.7&#160;eV. This alloy is incorporated in an electrolyte&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting device structure that can tune the recombination zone laterally. Thus, a continuous and reversible color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting device is successfully fabricated by controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor&#8208;based broadband optical applications.

It is proved&#160;that a bilayer nanostructure array is sufficient to completely control amplitudes, polarizations, and phases of coherent light transmission. Universal metasurfaces with such full control are realized with silicon nanostructures. A new kind of 3D&#160;vector hologram and a general platform for arbitrary optical transformation are demonstrated. This work provides another degree of freedom in light transmission control.








Recent advances in metasurfaces and optical nanostructures have enabled complex control of incident light with optically thin devices. However, it has thus far been unclear whether it is possible to achieve complete linear control of coherent light transmission, that is, independent control of polarization, amplitude, and phase for both input polarization states, with just a single, thin nanostructure array. Here, it is proved possible, and a universal metasurface is proposed, a bilayer array of high&#8208;index elliptic cylinders&#160;that possesses a complete degree of optical freedom with fully designable chirality and anisotropy. The completeness of achievable light control is mathematically shown with corresponding Jones matrices, new types of 3D&#160;holographic schemes that&#160;were&#160;formerly impossible are experimentally demonstrated, and a systematic way of realizing any input&#8208;state&#8208;sensitive vector linear optical device is presented. The results unlock previously inaccessible degrees of freedom in light transmission control.

         <title>Enhanced Competition at the Nano&#8211;Bio Interface Enables Comprehensive Characterization of Protein Corona Dynamics and Deep Coverage of Proteomes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By increasing competition at the nano&#8211;bio interface, protein corona diversity and detection of low&#8208;abundance proteins such as cytokines and chemokines are significantly improved. Quantitative mass spectrometry (MS) data captures corona dynamics for 3000 individual proteins and provides a crucial resource for in&#8208;depth modeling of nano&#8211;bio interactions and the Vroman effect for in vitro and in vivo applications of nanomaterials.








Abstract
Introducing engineered nanoparticles (NPs) into a biofluid such as blood plasma leads to the formation of a selective and reproducible protein corona at the particle&#8211;protein interface, driven by the relationship between protein&#8211;NP affinity and protein abundance. This enables&#160;scalable systems that leverage protein&#8211;nano interactions to&#160;overcome current limitations of deep plasma proteomics in large cohorts. Here the importance of the protein to NP&#8208;surface ratio (P/NP) is demonstrated and protein corona formation dynamics are modeled, which determine the competition between proteins for binding. Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP&#8208;based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large&#8208;scale NP&#8208;based deep proteomic studies.

Tuning the P/NP ratio significantly modulates the protein corona composition, enhancing depth and precision of a fully automated NP-based deep proteomic workflow (Proteograph). By increasing the binding competition on engineered NPs, 1.2&#8211;1.7&#215; more proteins with 1% false discovery rate are identified on the surface of each NP, and up to 3&#215; more proteins compared to a standard plasma proteomics workflow. Moreover, the data suggest P/NP plays a significant role in determining the in vivo fate of nanomaterials in biomedical applications. Together, the study showcases the importance of P/NP as a key design element for biomaterials and nanomedicine in vivo and as a powerful tuning strategy for accurate, large-scale NP-based deep proteomic studies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Metal Confined in 2D Membranes for Molecular Recognition and Sieving towards Ethylene/Ethane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By rationally confining metal into 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channels, a graphene oxide (GO) interlayer with size&#8208;sieving property and molecular recognition effect can efficiently discriminate ethylene over ethane. The GO membrane exhibits outstanding separation performance far exceeding the ethylene/ethane upper&#8208;bound. The metal confined in the 2D nanostructure will be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.








Abstract
Membranes with nanochannels have exhibited great potential in molecular separations, while it remains a great challenge to separate molecules with very close physical properties and kinetic diameters (e.g., ethylene/ethane) owing to the lack of size&#8208;sieving property and specific affinity. Herein, a metal confined 2D&#160;sub&#8208;nanometer channel is reported to successfully discriminate ethylene over ethane via molecular recognition and sieving. Transition metal cations are paired with polyelectrolyte anions to achieve high dissociation activity, forming reversible complexation with ethylene. Aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy observes that the metals with size of &#8776;2&#160;nm are uniformly confined in graphene oxide (GO) interlayer channels with average height of &#8776;0.44&#160;nm, thereby cooperating the size&#8208;sieving effect with a molecular recognition ability toward ethylene and stimulating its selective transport over ethane. The resulting ultrathin (&#8776;60&#160;nm) membrane exhibits superior ethylene/ethane separation performance far beyond the polymeric upper&#8208;bound. Density functional theory (DFT) and molecular dynamic simulations reveal that the metal@2D interlayer channel provides a molecular recognition pathway for selective gas transport. The proposed metal confined in 2D channel with molecular recognition and sieving properties would have broad application in other related fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensor and energy conversion.

         <title>Regulating the Coordination Environment of Mesopore&#8208;Confined Single Atoms from Metalloprotein&#8208;MOFs for Highly Efficient Biocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis is developed. The enhanced catalytic activity of the Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) exhibit unparalleled atomic utilization and catalytic efficiency, yet it is challenging to modulate SACs with highly dispersed single&#8208;atoms, mesopores, and well&#8208;regulated coordination environment simultaneously&#160;and ultimately maximize their catalytic efficiency. Here, a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered SACs (Fe&#8208;SACs) is developed successfully via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) followed by pyrolysis. The results demonstrate that the constructed metalloprotein&#8208;MOF&#8208;templated Fe&#8208;SACs achieve up to 23&#8208;fold and 47&#8208;fold higher activity compared to those using metal ions as the single&#8208;atom source and those with large mesopores induced by Zn evaporation, respectively, as well as up to a 25&#8208;fold and 1900&#8208;fold higher catalytic efficiency compared to natural enzymes and natural&#8208;enzyme&#8208;immobilized MOFs. Furthermore, this strategy can be generalized to a variety of metal&#8208;containing metalloproteins and enzymes. The enhanced catalytic activity of Fe&#8208;SACs benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, mesopores, as well as the regulated coordination environment of single&#8208;atom active sites induced by metalloproteins. Furthermore, the developed Fe&#8208;SACs act as an excellent and effective therapeutic platform for suppressing tumor cell growth. This work advances the development of highly efficient SACs using metalloproteins&#8208;MOFs as a template with diverse biotechnological applications.

         <title>An Integrated 3D Hydrophilicity/Hydrophobicity Design for Artificial Sweating Skin (i&#8208;TRANS) Mimicking Human Body Perspiration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile surface modification method for fibrous materials is developed to fabricate artificial sweating skin, based on an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design. With the hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both the lateral and vertical directions, the constructed &#8220;skin&#8221; can transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation.








Abstract
Artificial skins reproducing properties of human skin are emerging and significant for study in various areas, such as robotics, medicine, and textiles. Perspiration, as one of the most imperative thermoregulation functions of human skin, is gaining increasing attention, but how to realize ideal artificial skin for perspiration simulation remains challenging. Here, an integrated 3D hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity design is proposed for artificial sweating skin (i&#8208;TRANS). Based on normal fibrous wicking materials, the selective surface modification with gradient of poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) creates hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity contrast in both lateral and vertical directions. With the additional help of bottom hydrophilic Nylon 6 nanofibers, the constructed i&#8208;TRANS is able to transport &#8220;sweat&#8221; directionally without trapping undesired excess water and attain uniform &#8220;secretion&#8221; of sweat droplets on the top surface, decently mimicking human skin perspiration situation. This fairly comparable simulation not only presents new insights for replicating skin properties, but also provides proper in vitro testing platforms for perspiration&#8208;relevant research, greatly avoiding unwanted interference from the &#8220;skin&#8221; layer. In addition, the facile, fast, and cost&#8208;effective fabrication approach and versatile usage of i&#8208;TRANS can further facilitate its application.

         <title>A Smart Photothermal Nanosystem with an Intrinsic Temperature&#8208;Control Mechanism for Thermostatic Treatment of Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism is established for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections. In contrast to conventional photothermal therapy with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has attracted extensive attention in disease treatments. However, conventional photothermal systems do not possess a temperature&#8208;control mechanism, which poses a serious risk to healthy tissues and/or organs due to inevitable thermal damage. Herein, a smart photothermal nanosystem with an intrinsic temperature&#8208;control mechanism for thermostatic treatment of bacterial infections is reported. The smart photothermal nanosystem is constructed by loading a thermochromic material into a hollow&#8208;structured silica nanocarrier, in which the thermochromic material is composed of naturally occurring phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), a proton&#8208;responsive spirolactone, and a proton source. The resulting nanosystem shows strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and efficient photothermal conversion in solid PCMs but becomes NIR&#8208;transparent when PCMs are melted upon NIR irradiation. Such an attractive feature can precisely regulate the photothermal equilibrium temperature to the melting point of PCMs, regardless of the variation in external experimental parameters. In contrast to conventional PTT with severe thermal damage, the reported smart photothermal nanosystem provides an internal protection mechanism on healthy tissues and/or organs, which remarkably accelerates the recovery of bacteria&#8208;infected wounds. The smart photothermal nanosystem is a versatile PTT platform, holding great promise in the safe and efficient treatment of bacterial infections and multimodality synergistic therapy.

         <title>Chemical Welding of the Electrode&#8211;Electrolyte Interface by Zn&#8208;Metal&#8208;Initiated In Situ Gelation for Ultralong&#8208;Life Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

The in situ gel electrolyte initiated by Zn metal produces chemical welding between the anode and the electrolyte, enabling a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface that suppresses the growth of Zn dendrites and side reactions while improving the Zn utilization up to 87%. The as&#8208;prepared cells showcase superior cycling stability, with an ultralong life of over 212&#160;days.








Abstract
A compatible and robust electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface is favorable in resolving the severe dendritic growth and side reactions of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries toward commercial&#8208;standard lifespan and charging&#8211;discharging rate. Herein, a chemical welding strategy through in&#160;situ construction of a gel electrolyte that enables Zn&#8208;ion batteries to achieve ultralong life and reversibility is reported. The gel electrolyte is spontaneously formed on the Zn anode surface by redox polymerization with the initiation of Zn metal. The direct participation of the Zn anode in the chemical synthesis of the gel electrolyte brings a well&#8208;bonded and water&#8208;poor electrode&#8211;electrolyte interface, which not only alleviates side reactions but also enables preferential (002) Zn deposition. The in&#160;situ symmetric cell thus prepared delivers an ultralong lifespan of 5100&#160;h (&gt;212&#160;days), and a hybrid capacitor with the in&#160;situ electrolyte runs smoothly over 40&#160;000&#160;cycles at 20&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. Even at an ultrahigh current density of 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;and capacity of 40&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2, the cell still operates stably for 240&#160;h, alongside a high Zn utilization with 87% depth of discharge. The in&#160;situ gel electrolyte integrating robust interface and preparation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one cells demonstrate a commercializable path for aqueous Zn&#8208;storage devices.

         <title>Triple&#8208;Function Electrolyte Regulation toward Advanced Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>

Zn&#8208;battery issues in aqueous media are fundamentally studied, revealing that besides the well&#8208;known H2 evolution and dendrite growth, Zn electrodes also face an O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction. Thus, a one&#8208;off electrolyte regulation is proposed by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P additive, which can take effects to suppress the O2&#8208;involving corrosion reaction, water decomposition, and dendritic deposition during the shelf time.








Abstract
The poor Zn reversibility has been criticized for limiting applications of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs); however, its behavior in aqueous media is not fully uncovered yet. Here, this knowledge gap is addressed, indicating that Zn electrodes face a O2&#8208;involving corrosion, besides H2 evolution and dendrite growth. Differing from aqueous Li/Na batteries, removing O2 cannot enhance ZIB performance because of the aggravated competing H2 evolution. To address Zn issues, a one&#8208;off electrolyte strategy is reported by introducing the triple&#8208;function C3H7Na2O6P, which can take effects during the shelf time of battery. It regulates H+ concentration and reduces free&#8208;water activity, inhibiting H2 evolution. A self&#8208;healing solid/electrolyte interphase (SEI) can be triggered before battery operation, which suppresses O2 adsorption corrosion and dendritic deposition. Consequently, a high Zn reversibility of 99.6% is achieved under a high discharge depth of 85%. The pouch full&#8208;cell with a lean electrolyte displays a record lifespan with capacity retention of 95.5% after 500 cycles. This study not only looks deeply into Zn behavior in aqueous media but also underscores rules for the design of active metal anodes, including Zn and Li metals, during shelf time toward real applications.

A flexible and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; structure is designed for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries, in which an in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability.








Abstract
The construction of robust (quasi)&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) for flexible lithium&#8208;metal batteries is desirable but extremely challenging. Herein, a novel, flexible, and robust quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte (QSSE) with a &#8220;tree&#8208;trunk&#8221; design is reported for ultralong&#8208;life lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). An in&#8208;situ&#8208;grown metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) layer covers the cellulose&#8208;based framework to form hierarchical ion&#8208;channels, enabling rapid ionic transfer kinetics and excellent durability. A conductivity of 1.36&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1, a transference number of 0.72, an electrochemical window of 5.26&#160;V, and a good rate performance are achieved. The flexible LMBs fabricated with as&#8208;designed QSSEs deliver areal capacity of up to 3.1&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 at the initial cycle with high mass loading of 14.8&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 in Li&#8208;NCM811 cells and can retain &#8776;80% capacity retention after 300 cycles. An ultralong&#8208;life of 3000 cycles (6000&#160;h) is also achieved in Li&#8208;LiFePO4 cells. This work presents a promising route in constructing a flexible QSSE toward ultralong&#8208;life LMBs, and also provides a design rationale for material and structure development in the area of energy storage and conversion.

         <title>A Honeycomb&#8208;Like Porous Crystalline Hetero&#8208;Electrocatalyst for Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of honeycomb&#8208;like metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)@covalent organic framework (COF) heterostructures with integrated porous MOF template and ultrathin COF coating are synthesized and successfully applied in efficient CO2 electroreduction to CH4.








Abstract
Porous heterostructured electrocatalysts with multifunctionality and synergistic effect have much benefit for efficient electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet it still remains a daunting challenge to explore heterostructures based on covalent organic frameworks (COFs) and metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) in this field. Here, a series of honeycomb&#8208;like porous crystalline hetero&#8208;electrocatalysts (MCH&#8208;X, X&#160;= 1&#8211;4, X stands for the numbered sample obtained from different MOF doses in the synthesis of the MCH) are synthesized, and these are successfully applied in electrocatalytic CO2RR. The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF&#8208;template and ultrathin COF&#8208;coating enable efficient CO2 adsorption/activation and conversion into CH4. The best of them, MCH&#8208;3, shows greatly inhibited H2 evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb&#8208;like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO2 adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate&#8208;determining step are intensively studied.

The specially designed heterostructures with integrated porous MOF-template and ultrathin COF-coating enable efficient CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation and conversion into CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. The best of them, MCH-3, shows greatly inhibited H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution, excellent current density (&#8722;398.1&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), and superior FECH4${\rm{F}}{{\rm{E}}_{{\rm{C}}{{\rm{H}}_4}}}$ (76.7%) to the physical mixture (38.0%), the MOF@COF without the honeycomb-like morphology (47.7%), and the bare COF (37.5%) and MOF (15.9%) at &#8722;1.0&#160;V. Based on the density functional theory calculations and various characterizations, the vital roles of the MOF in facilitating CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption/activation, stabilizing intermediates, and conquering the energy barrier of rate-determining step are intensively studied.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

An adaptive robotic skin with augmented pressure sensing ability is introduced. Integrated tunable pressure sensors built with uniform gallium microgranules provide high sensitivity and bandwidth and excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, enabling a large&#8208;scale robotic skin with sensing performance superior to human skin. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstrations show its unique sensing capability and versatility covering a broad range of pressure.








Robotic skin with human&#8208;skin&#8208;like sensing ability holds immense potential in various fields such as robotics, prosthetics, healthcare, and industries. To catch up with human skin, numerous studies are underway on pressure sensors integrated on robotic skin to improve the sensitivity and detection range. However, due to the trade&#8208;off between them, existing pressure sensors have achieved only a single aspect, either high sensitivity or wide bandwidth. Here, an adaptive robotic skin is proposed that has both high sensitivity and broad bandwidth with an augmented pressure sensing ability beyond the human skin. A key for the adaptive robotic skin is a tunable pressure sensor built with uniform gallium microgranules embedded in an elastomer, which provides large tuning of the sensitivity and the bandwidth, excellent sensor&#8208;to&#8208;sensor uniformity, and high reliability. Through the mode conversion based on the solid&#8211;liquid phase transition of gallium microgranules, the sensor provides 97% higher sensitivity (16.97 kPa&#8722;1) in the soft mode and 262.5% wider bandwidth (&#8776;1.45&#160;MPa) in the rigid mode compared to the human skin. Successful demonstration of the adaptive robotic skin verifies its capabilities in sensing a wide spectrum of pressures ranging from subtle blood pulsation to body weight, suggesting broad use for various applications.

         <title>Nonequilibrium Lattice Dynamics in Photoexcited 2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonequilibrium structures of 2D perovskites are studied using ultrafast X&#8208;ray diffraction. Diffraction peaks post&#8208;photoexcitation increase in intensity and narrow over 1 ns, suggesting an increase in long&#8208;range order within the lead iodide octahedra. These results are corroborated using ultrafast photoluminescence, which shows redshifting and narrowing of photoluminescence peaks on the same timescale as transient X&#8208;ray diffraction.








Abstract
Interplay between structural and photophysical properties of metal halide perovskites is critical to their utility in optoelectronics, but there is limited understanding of lattice response upon photoexcitation. Here, 2D perovskites butylammonium lead iodide, (BA)2PbI4, and phenethylammonium lead iodide, (PEA)2PbI4, are investigated using ultrafast transient X&#8208;ray diffraction as a function of optical excitation fluence to discern structural dynamics. Both powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence linewidths narrow over 1 ns following optical excitation for the fluence range studied, concurrent with slight redshifting of the optical bandgaps. These observations are attributed to transient relaxation and ordering of distorted lead iodide octahedra stimulated mainly by electron&#8211;hole pair creation. The c axis expands up to 0.37% over hundreds of picoseconds; reflections sampling the a and b axes undergo one tenth of this expansion with the same timescale. Post&#8208;photoexcitation appearance of the (110) reflection in (BA)2PbI4 would suggest a transient phase transition,&#160;however, through new single&#8208;crystal XRD, reflections are found that violate glide plane conditions in the reported Pbca structure. The static structure space group is reassigned as P212121. With this, a nonequilibrium phase transition is ruled out. These findings offer increased understanding of remarkable lattice response in 2D perovskites upon excitation.

         <title>Strong Electronic Metal&#8211;Support Interaction between Iridium Single Atoms and a WO3 Support Promotes Highly Efficient and Robust CO2 Cycloaddition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ir single atoms are stably anchored on the WO3 support via a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). The catalyst demonstrates an excellent activity and stability for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate at relatively low temperatures, superior to most other heterogeneous competitors. Such a great performance is understood as a direct result of the strong EMSI effect.








Abstract
The carbon dioxide (CO2) cycloaddition of epoxides to cyclic carbonates is of great industrial importance owing to the high economical values of its products. Single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) have great potential in CO2 cycloaddition by virtue of their high atom utilization efficiency and desired activity, but they generally suffer from poor reaction stability and catalytic activity arising from the weak interaction between the active centers and the supports. In this work, Ir single atoms stably anchored on the WO3 support (Ir1&#8211;WO3) are developed with a strong electronic metal&#8211;support interaction (EMSI). Superior CO2 cycloaddition is realized in the Ir1&#8211;WO3 catalyst via the EMSI effect: 100% conversion efficiency for the CO2 cycloaddition of styrene oxide to styrene carbonate after 15&#160;h at 40 &#176;C and excellent stability with no degradation even after ten reaction cycles for a total of more than 150&#160;h. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the EMSI effect results in significant charge redistribution between the Ir single atoms and the WO3 support, and consequently lowers the energy barrier associated with epoxide ring opening. This work furnishes new insights into the catalytic mechanism of CO2 cycloaddition and would guide the design of stable SACs for efficient CO2 cycloaddition reactions.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Robust Full&#8208;Color Organic Afterglow through 2D Superlattices Embedment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient and universal strategy is proposed to prepare high&#8208;performance and robust organic afterglow with high figures&#8208;of&#8208;merit by 2D&#160;hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices embedment of phosphors. Deep&#8208;blue organic afterglow with high efficiency up to 65%, ultralong lifetime over 1300 ms, and robust emission that can resist the quenching effects from oxygen, solvent, stress, and heat is achieved.








Abstract
Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self&#8208;assembled 2D hydrogen&#8208;bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep&#8208;blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep&#8208;blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep&#8208;blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high&#8208;performance, robust, and full&#8208;color POA materials, flexible anti&#8208;counterfeit displays and direct&#8208;current (DC)&#8208;driven lifetime&#8208;encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.

&lt;p&gt;Purely organic afterglow (POA) originating from the slow radiative decay of stabilized triplet excited states has shown amazing potential in many fields. However, achieving highly stable POA with high phosphorescent quantum yield (PhQY) and long lifetime is still a formidable challenge owing to the intrinsically active and sensitive nature of triplet excitons. Here, triplet excitons of phosphors are protected and stabilized by embedding in tricomponent trihapto self-assembled 2D hydrogen-bonded superlattices, which not only enables deep-blue POA with high PhQY (up to 65%), ultralong lifetime (over 1300&#160;ms) and the highest figure-of-merit at room temperature, but also achieves excellent stability capable of resisting quenching effects of oxygen, solvent, pressure, light, and heat. In addition, the POA color is tuned from deep-blue to red via efficient F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer from the deep-blue POA emitters to the fluorophores. Moreover, with the high-performance, robust, and full-color POA materials, flexible anti-counterfeit displays and direct-current (DC)-driven lifetime-encrypted color Morse Code applications are facilely realized.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing of Prussian Blue Analogues with Electrochemically Driven Morphological Rejuvenation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phenomenon of self&#8208;healing can be determined through kinetic dynamics under an electric field in terms of an &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic morphology variations in Prussian blue analogue electrodes.








Abstract
Maintaining the morphology of electrode materials with high invertibility contributes to the prolonged cyclic stability of battery systems. However, the majority of electrode materials tend to degrade during the charge&#8211;discharge process owing to the inevitable increase in entropy. Herein, a self&#8208;healing strategy is designed to promote morphology rejuvenation in Prussian blue analogue (PBA) cathodes by cobalt doping. Experimental characterization and theoretical calculations demonstrate that a trace amount of cobalt can decelerate the crystallization process and restore the cracked areas to ensure perfect cubic structures of PBA cathodes. The electric field controls the kinetic dynamics, rather than the conventional thermodynamics, to realize the &#8220;electrochemically driven dissolution&#8211;recrystallization process&#8221; for the periodic self&#8208;healing phenomenon. The properties of electron transportation and ion diffusion in bulk PBA are also improved by the doping strategy, thus boosting the cyclability with 4000 cycles in a diluent electrolyte. This discovery provides a new paradigm for the construction of self&#8208;healing electrodes for cathodes.

         <title>Ultrathin Covalent Organic Framework Membranes Prepared by Rapid Electrophoretic Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel two&#8208;cell electrophoretic deposition strategy to assemble covalent organic frameworks (COFs) nanosheets into ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures within several minutes is reported. The constructed COF membranes exhibit outstanding separation performance toward the negatively charged probe molecules with a dimension larger than 1&#160;nm due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are a disruptive material platform for various novel applications including nanofiltration for water purification due to their excellent physicochemical features. Nevertheless, the currently available approaches for preparing COF membranes need stringent synthesis conditions, prolonged fabrication time, and tedious post&#8208;processing, leading to poor productivity. Herein, a simple and efficient layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking assembly strategy is developed based on electrophoretic deposition (EPD) to rapidly generate ionic COF membranes due to the uniform driving force for nanosheet assembly. A new two&#8208;cell EPD design avoids the usual EPD problems such as bubbles and acidic/alkaline microenvironments in the near&#8208;electrode region in aqueous EPD processes. Ultrathin COF membranes with homogenous structures can be produced within several minutes. Consequently, the prepared COF membranes exhibit outstanding permselectivity and possess good stability and anti&#8208;pressure ability due to their uniform architecture and unique chemical composition.

         <title>Nature&#8208;Inspired Design of Molybdenum&#8211;Selenium Dual&#8208;Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The critical role of the synergy between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms for the promotion of electrochemical CO2 reduction performance is highlighted. This is similar to the synergy of nonmetallic elements and metal active centers in enzymes. More importantly, the distance effect between nonmetallic single atoms and transition&#8208;metal single atoms is clarified.








Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction (ECR) is becoming an increasingly important technology for achieving carbon neutrality. Inspired by the structure of naturally occurring Mo&#8208;dependent enzymes capable of activating CO2, a heteronuclear Mo&#8211;Se dual&#8208;single&#8208;atom electrocatalyst (MoSA&#8211;SeSA) for ECR into CO with a Faradaic efficiency of above 90% over a broad potential window from &#8722;0.4 to &#8722;1.0&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode is demonstrated here. Both operando characterization and theoretical simulation results verify that MoSA acts as central atoms that directly interact with the ECR feedstock and intermediates, whereas the SeSA adjacent to MoSA modulates the electronic structure of MoSA through long&#8208;range electron delocalization for inhibiting MoSA poisoning caused by strong CO adsorption. In addition, the SeSAs far from MoSA help suppress the competing hydrogen evolution side reaction and accelerate the CO2 transport by repelling H2O. This work provides new insight into the precise regulation and in&#8208;depth understanding of multisite synergistic catalysis at the atomic scale.

         <title>Ultrathin Piezoelectric Resonators Based on Graphene and Free&#8208;Standing Single&#8208;Crystal BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Piezoelectric resonators are ubiquitous elements for frequency filtering in telecom devices. A piezoelectric resonator consisting of a suspended van der Waals heterostructure of ultrathin single&#8208;crystal free&#8208;standing BaTiO3 sandwiched between graphene sheets is reported. The heterostructure is piezoelectrically driven into a flexural motion and the resulting mechanics shows ferroelectric switching. The bulk&#8208;mode resonance at 233 GHz is the highest reported.








Abstract
Suspended piezoelectric thin films are key elements enabling high&#8208;frequency filtering in telecommunication devices. To meet the requirements of next&#8208;generation electronics, it is essential to reduce device thickness for reaching higher resonance frequencies. Here, the high&#8208;quality mechanical and electrical properties of graphene electrodes are combined with the strong piezoelectric performance of the free&#8208;standing complex oxide, BaTiO3 (BTO), to create ultrathin piezoelectric resonators. It is demonstrated that the device can be brought into mechanical resonance by piezoelectric actuation. By sweeping the DC bias voltage on the top graphene electrode, the BTO membrane is switched between the two poled ferroelectric states. Remarkably, ferroelectric hysteresis is also observed in the resonance frequency, magnitude and Q&#8208;factor of the first membrane mode. In the bulk acoustic mode, the device vibrates at 233 GHz. This work demonstrates the potential of combining van der Waals materials with complex oxides for next&#8208;generation electronics, which not only opens up opportunities for increasing filter frequencies, but also enables reconfiguration by poling, via ferroelectric memory effect.

         <title>A Multi&#8208;Bioactive Nanomicelle&#8208;Based &#8220;One Stone for Multiple Birds&#8221; Strategy for Precision Therapy of Abdominal Aortic Aneurysms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.








Abstract
Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro&#8208;inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&#8722;1. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site&#8208;specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti&#8208;aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi&#8208;bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.

&lt;p&gt;A &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy is proposed for therapy of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). Three engineered conjugates can assemble into nanomicelles capable of inhibiting migration/activation of inflammatory cells and protecting smooth muscle cells from oxidative stress, calcification, and apoptosis. Intravenously delivered nanomicelles efficiently accumulate in aneurysms of rats and distribute in multiple pathological cells, thereby alleviating AAA progression.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) remains a lethal aortic disease in the elderly. Currently, no effective drugs can be clinically applied to prevent the development of AAA. Herein, a &#8220;one stone for multiple birds&#8221; strategy for AAA therapy is reported. As a proof of concept, three bioactive conjugates are designed and synthesized, which can assemble into nanomicelles. Cellularly, these nanomicelles significantly inhibit migration and activation of inflammatory cells as well as protect vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) from induced oxidative stress, calcification and apoptosis, with the best effect for nanomicelles (TPTN) derived from a conjugate defined as TPT. After intravenous delivery, TPTN efficiently accumulates in the aneurysmal tissue of AAA rats, showing notable distribution in neutrophils, macrophages and VSMCs, all relevant to AAA pathogenesis. Whereas three examined nanomicelles effectively delay expansion of AAA in rats, TPTN most potently prevents AAA growth by simultaneously normalizing the pro-inflammatory microenvironment and regulating multiple pathological cells. TPTN is effective even at 0.2&#160;mg&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. Besides, TPTN can function as a bioactive nanoplatform for site-specifically delivering and triggerably releasing anti-aneurysmal drugs, affording synergistic therapeutic effects. Consequently, TPTN is a promising multi-bioactive nanotherapy and bioresponsive targeting delivery nanocarrier for effective therapy of AAA and other inflammatory vascular diseases.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Local Diverse Polarization Optimized Comprehensive Energy&#8208;Storage Performance in Lead&#8208;Free Superparaelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Excellent energy&#8208;storage properties with an ultrahigh recoverable energy storage density &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 and a large efficiency &#8776;87.6% are realized in lead&#8208;free relaxor ferroelectrics, which is responsible by the local diverse polarization design, leading to the ultrasmall polar nanoregions, reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to single polarization configuration.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free dielectric ceramics with ultrahigh energy&#8208;storage performance are the core components used in next&#8208;generation advanced pulse power capacitors. However, the low energy storage density largely hinders their development towards miniaturization, lightweight, and integration. Here, an effective strategy of constructing local diverse polarization is designed in superparaelectrics to realize an ultrahigh energy storage density of &#8776;10.59 J cm&#8722;3 as well as a large efficiency of &#8776;87.6%. The excellent comprehensive energy&#8208;storage performance is mainly attributed to the design of ultrasmall polar nanoregions with local diverse polarization configuration, confirmed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, leading to the reduced heat loss, substantially enhanced polarization, and breakdown electric field compared to ceramics with single polarization configuration. Benefiting from these features, outstanding temperature/frequency/cycling stability and superior charge/discharge performance (power density &#8776;187.5 MW cm&#8722;3, discharge energy density &#8776;3.52 J cm&#8722;3, discharge rate &#8776;77&#160;ns) are also achieved. This work demonstrates that local diverse polarization is a super strategy to design new dielectric materials with high energy&#8208;storage performance.

Robotic Skin
In article number 2204805, Jae&#8208;Woong Jeong and co&#8208;workers report an adaptive robotic skin with an augmented pressure&#8208;sensing capability beyond that of human skin. The robotic skin is composed of gallium microgranules fabricated uniformly using a T&#8208;junction microfluidic system. Through the phase transition of gallium microgranules, it achieves a higher sensitivity in the soft mode and a broader dynamic range in the rigid mode compared to human skin.

Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts
In article number 2205674, Kang Liang and co&#8208;workers develop a generalized strategy to construct highly active ferric&#8208;centered single&#8208;atom catalysts via a biomineralization strategy that enables the homogeneous encapsulation of metalloproteins within metal&#8208;organic frameworks followed by pyrolysis. The enhanced activity of the obtained catalysts benefits from the highly dispersed atoms, the mesopores, and the regulated coordination environment of the single&#8208;atom active sites induced by the metalloproteins.

Confined 2D Channels
2D&#8208;material membranes have demonstrated great potential in molecular separation. In article number 2206349, Gongping Liu and co&#8208;workers rationally confine metal into sub&#8208;nanometer GO galleries, endowing 2D channels with molecular recognition and sieving properties for discriminating ethylene over ethane. The metal confined in a 2D nanostructure would be of interest in other fields such as single&#8208;atom catalysis, sensors, and energy conversion.

Light&#8208;Emitting Devices
A color&#8208;tunable light&#8208;emitting diode is realized by Jiang Pu, Yasumitsu Miyata, Taishi Takenobu, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2203250 using compositionally graded monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide alloys. By controlling the light&#8208;emitting positions in the alloys, the composition gradient of the bandgap enables continuous and reversible light emission with energies ranging from 2.1 to 1.7 eV. The results provide a new approach for exploring monolayer semiconductor alloy based broadband optoelectronic device applications.

Proteomics
In article number 2206008, Omid C. Farokhzad, Daniel Hornburg, and co&#8208;workers show how the Vroman effect can be leveraged to capture the complexity of human proteomes using engineered nanoparticles. Protein corona formation dynamics demonstrate how nanoparticle functionalization and nano&#8211;bio binding competition enable deep and quantitative interrogation of biosamples. This facilitates increased capture of low&#8208;abundance proteins, including cytokines and chemokines, enabling new strategies for biomarker discovery and personalized nanomedicine.

         <title>Organic Hole&#8208;Transport Layers for Efficient, Stable, and Scalable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) attract great attention due to their low&#8208;temperature processing, negligible hysteresis, and superior stability. For these devices, hole&#8208;transport layers play a decisive role in carrier extraction, transport, and perovskite crystallization. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the structural engineering of organic hole&#8208;transport layers utilized in inverted PSCs including conductive polymers, small molecules, and emerging self&#8208;assembled monolayers.








Abstract
Hole&#8208;transporting layers (HTLs) are an essential component in inverted, p&#8211;i&#8211;n perovskite solar cells (PSCs) where they play a decisive role in extraction and transport of holes, surface passivation, perovskite crystallization, device stability, and cost. Currently, the exploration of efficient, stable, highly transparent and low&#8208;cost HTLs is of vital importance for propelling p&#8211;i&#8211;n PSCs toward commercialization. Compared to their inorganic counterparts, organic HTLs offer multiple advantages such as a tunable bandgap and energy level, easy synthesis and purification, solution processability, and overall low cost. Here, recent progress of organic HTLs, including conductive polymers, small molecules, and self&#8208;assembled monolayers, as utilized in inverted PSCs is systematically reviewed and summarized. Their molecular structure, hole&#8208;transport properties, energy levels, and relevant device properties and resulting performances are presented and analyzed. A summary of design principles and a future outlook toward highly efficient organic HTLs in inverted PSCs is proposed. This review aims to inspire further innovative development of novel organic HTLs for more efficient, stable, and scalable inverted PSCs.

         <title>Tailoring Materials for Epilepsy Imaging: From Biomarkers to Imaging Probes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 44, November 3, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A framework for understanding potential biomarkers of epilepsy is provided and they are classified them into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis. Then, the materials used to fabricate the imaging probes and their performances in defining the epileptic foci are highlighted. Imaging strategies overcoming the heterogenous nature of epilepsy are thoroughly discussed.








Abstract
Excising epileptic foci (EF) is the most efficient approach for treating drug&#8208;resistant epilepsy (DRE). However, owing to the vast heterogeneity of epilepsies, EF in one&#8208;third of patients cannot be accurately located, even after exhausting all current diagnostic strategies. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that truly represent the status of epilepsy and fabricating probes with high targeting specificity are prerequisites for identifying the &#8220;concealed&#8221; EF. However, no systematic summary of this topic has been published. Herein, the potential biomarkers of EF are first summarized and classified into three categories: functional, molecular, and structural aberrances during epileptogenesis, a procedure of nonepileptic brain biasing toward epileptic tissue. The materials used to fabricate these imaging probes and their performance in defining the EF in preclinical and clinical studies are highlighted. Finally, perspectives for developing the next generation of probes and their challenges in clinical translation are discussed. In general, this review can be helpful in guiding the development of imaging probes defining EF with improved accuracy and holds promise for increasing the number of DRE patients who are eligible for surgical intervention.
