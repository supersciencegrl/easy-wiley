         <title>Atomically Dispersed Dual&#8208;Site Cathode with a Record High Sulfur Mass Loading for High&#8208;Performance Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Abstract
Room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT&#8208;Na/S) batteries possess high potential for grid&#8208;scale stationary energy storage due to their low cost and high energy density. However, the issues arising from the low S mass loading and poor cycling stability caused by the shuttle effect of polysulfides seriously limit their operating capacity and cycling capability. Herein, sulfur&#8208;doped graphene frameworks supporting atomically dispersed 2H&#8208;MoS2 and Mo1 (S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF) with a record high sulfur mass loading of 80.9 wt% were synthesized as an integrated dual active sites cathode for RT&#8208;Na/S batteries. Impressively, the as&#8208;prepared S@MoS2&#8208;Mo1/SGF displayed unprecedented cyclic stability with a high initial capacity of 1017 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1 and a low&#8208;capacity fading rate of 0.05% per cycle over 1000 cycles. Experimental and computational results including X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), in&#8208;situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and density&#8208;functional theory calculations reveal that atomic&#8208;level Mo in this integrated dual&#8208;active&#8208;site forms a delocalized electron system, which could improve the reactivity of sulfur and reaction reversibility of S and Na, greatly alleviating the shuttle effect. The findings not only provide an effective strategy to fabricate high&#8208;performance dual&#8208;site cathodes, but also deepen the understanding of their enhancement mechanisms at an atomic level.

         <title>Solar&#8208;Driven Reversible Hydrogen Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The lack of safe and efficient hydrogen storage is a major bottleneck for large&#8208;scale application of hydrogen energy. Reversible hydrogen storage of light&#8208;weight metal hydrides with high theoretical gravimetric and volumetric hydrogen density is one ideal solution but requires extremely high operating temperature with large energy input. Herein, taking MgH2 as an example, we demonstrate a concept to achieve solar&#8208;driven reversible hydrogen storage of metal hydrides via coupling the photothermal effect and catalytic role of Cu nanoparticles uniformly distributed on the surface of MXene nanosheets (Cu@MXene). The photothermal effect of Cu@MXene, coupled with the &#8220;heat isolator&#8221; role of MgH2 indued by its poor thermal conductivity, effectively elevates the temperature of MgH2 upon solar irradiation. The &#8220;hydrogen pump&#8221; effect of Ti and TiHx species that are in&#8208;situ formed on the surface of MXene from the reduction of MgH2, on the other hand, plays a catalytic role in effectively alleviating the kinetic barrier and hence decreasing the operating temperature required for reversible hydrogen adsorption and desorption of MgH2. Based on the combination of photothermal and catalytic effect of Cu@MXene, a reversible hydrogen storage capacity of 5.9&#160;wt.% is achieved for MgH2 after 30 cycles using solar irradiation as the only energy source.

         <title>Polarization&#8208;Tunable Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Metatransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Emerging immersive visual communication technologies require light sources with complex functionality for dynamic control of polarization, directivity, wavefront, spectrum, and intensity of light. Currently, this is mostly achieved by free space bulk optic elements, limiting the adoption of these technologies. Flat optics based on artificially structured metasurfaces that operate at the sub&#8208;wavelength scale are a viable solution, however their integration into electrically driven devices remains challenging. Here we demonstrate a radically new approach of monolithic integration of a dielectric metasurface into a perovskite light&#8208;emitting transistor. We show that nanogratings directly structured on top of the transistor channel yield an 8&#8208;fold increase of electroluminescence intensity and dynamic tunability of polarization. This new light&#8208;emitting metatransistor device concept opens unlimited opportunities for light management strategies based on metasurface design and integration.

         <title>A Monolithic Stochastic Computing Architecture for Energy Efficient Arithmetic</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As the energy and hardware investments necessary for conventional high&#8208;precision digital computing continues to explode in the emerging era of artificial intelligence, deep learning, and big data, a change in paradigm that can trade precision for energy and resource efficiency is being sought for many computing applications. Stochastic computing (SC) is an attractive alternative since unlike digital computers, which require many logic gates and a high transistor volume to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, sorting, etc., SC can implement the same using simple logic gates. While it is possible to accelerate SC using traditional silicon complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the need for extensive hardware investment to generate stochastic bits (s&#8208;bits), the fundamental computing primitive for SC, makes it less attractive. Memristor and spin&#8208;based devices offer natural randomness but depend on hybrid designs involving CMOS peripherals for accelerating SC, which increases area and energy burden. Here, we overcome the limitations of existing and emerging technologies and experimentally demonstrate a standalone SC architecture embedded in memory based on two&#8208;dimensional (2D) memtransistors. Our monolithic and non&#8208;von Neumann SC architecture consumes a miniscule amount of energy (&lt; 1 nJ) for both s&#8208;bit generation and arithmetic operations, and it also occupies a small hardware footprint, highlighting the benefits of SC.

         <title>In Situ Observation of Fracture along Twin Boundaries in Boron Carbide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic structure of B4C and its fracture behaviors are investigated by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected STEM and in situ TEM mechanical testing. The combination of in situ TEM observations and quantum mechanics calculations reveal that amorphous bands and crack initiation occur preferentially at the twin boundaries in B4C under mechanical loading, thus contributing to the failure of B4C.








Abstract
The observation of fracture behaviors in perfect and twinned B4C crystals via in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) mechanical testing is reported. The crystal structure of the synthesized B4C, composed of B11C icosahedra connected by boron&#8208;deficient C&#8211;&#9643;&#8211;C chains in a chemical formula of B11C3, is determined by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art aberration&#8208;corrected scanning TEM. The in situ TEM observations reveal that cracking is preferentially initiated at the twin boundaries (TBs) in B4C under both indentation and tension loading. The cracks then propagate along the TBs, thus resulting in the fracture of B4C. These results are consistent with the theoretical calculations that show that TBs have a softening effect on B4C with amorphous bands preferentially nucleated at the TBs. These findings elucidate the atomic arrangement and the role of planar defects in the failure of B4C. Furthermore, they can guide the design of advanced superhard materials via planar defect control.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

         <title>3D&#8208;bioprinted Phantom with Human Skin Phototypes for Biomedical Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We report 3D&#8208;bioprinted skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with skin colors ranging across the Fitzpatrick scale. These tools can help understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. Synthetic melanin nanoparticles of different sizes (70&#8211;500&#160;nm) and clusters were fabricated to mimic the optical behavior of melanosome. The absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient of the phantoms are comparable to real human skin. We further validated the melanin content and distribution in the phantoms versus real human skins via photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The PA signal of the phantom could be improved by (i) increasing melanin size (3&#8211;450&#8208;fold), (ii) increasing clustering (2&#8211;10.5&#8208;fold), and (iii) increasing concentration (1.3&#8211;8&#8208;fold). We then used multiple biomedical optics tools (e.g., PA, fluorescence imaging and photothermal therapy) to understand the impact of skin tone on these modalities. These well&#8208;defined 3D&#8208;bioprinted phantoms may have value in translating biomedical optics and reducing racial bias.

         <title>Reducing Trap Density in Organic Solar Cells via Extending Fused Ring Donor Unit of A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;Type Nonfullerene Acceptor for Over 17% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The high trap density (generally 1016&#8211;1018 cm&#8722;3) in thin films of organic semiconductors is the primary reason for the inferior charge carrier mobility and large nonradiative recombination energy loss (&#916;Enr) in organic solar cells (OSCs), limiting improvement in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). In this study, the trap density in OSCs is efficiently reduced via extending the donor core of nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) from heptacyclic unit to nonacyclic unit. TTPIC&#8208;4F with nonacyclic unit has stronger intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, affording higher crystallinity in thin films relative to its counterpart BTPIC&#8208;4F. Thus, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based device achieves a lower trap density of 4.02 &#215; 1015&#160;cm&#8722;3, comparable to some typical high&#8208;performance inorganic/hybrid semiconductors, with higher mobility and inhibited charge carrier recombination in devices. Therefore, the D18:TTPIC&#8208;4F&#8208;based OSC exhibits an impressive PCE of 17.1% with a low &#916;Enr of 0.208&#160;eV, which is the best known value for A&#8208;D&#8208;A&#8208;type NFAs. Therefore, extending the donor core of NFAs is an efficient method for suppressing trap states in OSCs for high PCEs.

         <title>Refining perovskite heterojunctions for effective light&#8208;emitting solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Solar cells capable of light&#8208;harvesting during daytime and light&#8208;emitting at night are multifunctional semiconductor devices with many potential applications. Here we report that halide perovskite heterojunction interfaces can be refined to yield stable and efficient solar cells. The cell can also operate effectively as an ultralow&#8208;voltage light&#8208;emitting diode with a peak external quantum efficiency of 3.3%. Spectroscopic and microscopic studies reveal that double&#8208;heterojunction refinement with wide&#8208;bandgap salts is key to densifying the packing of perovskite grains and enlarging the bandgaps of the perovskite surfaces that are in contact with charge transport semiconductors. The refined perovskite enables a simple device with dual actions of solar cells and light&#8208;emitting diodes. This type of all&#8208;in&#8208;one device has the potential for multifunctional harvesting&#8208;storage&#8208;utilization systems.

         <title>Triggering ZT to 0.40 by Engineering Orientation in One Polymeric Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Breaking the thermoelectric (TE) trade&#8208;off relationship is a dreaming task for maximizing the TE performance of polymeric semiconductors. Existing efforts have focused on designing high&#8208;mobility semiconductors and achieving ordered molecular doping, ignoring the critical role of the molecular orientation during TE conversion. Herein, we report the achievement of ZT to 0.40 by fine&#8208;tuning the molecular orientation of one diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;based polymer (DPP&#8208;BTz). Films with bimodal molecular orientation yield superior doping efficiency by increasing the lamellar spacing and achieve increased splitting between the Fermi energy and the transport energy to enhance the thermopower. These factors contribute to the simultaneous improvement in the Seebeck coefficient and electrical conductivity in an unexpected manner. Importantly, the bimodal film exhibited a maximum power factor of up to 346 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, &gt;400% higher than that of unimodal films. These results demonstrate the great potential of molecular orientation engineering in polymeric semiconductors for developing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OTE materials.

         <title>Electrolyte for High Energy&#8208; and Power&#8208;density Zinc Batteries and Ion Capacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dendrites growth, limited coulombic efficiency (CE) and the lack of high&#8208;voltage electrolytes restrict the commercialization of zinc batteries and capacitors. These issues are resolved by a new electrolyte, based on the zinc(II)&#8208;betaine complex [Zn(bet)2][NTf2]2. Solutions in acetonitrile (AN) avoid dendrite formation. A Zn||Zn cell operates stably over 10110 hours (5055 cycles) at 0.2 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2 or 110 hours at 50 mA&#183;cm&#8211;2, has an area capacity of 113 mAh&#183;cm&#8211;2 at 80% depth of discharge. A zinc&#8208;graphite battery performs at 2.6 V with a midpoint discharge&#8208;voltage of 2.4 V. The capacity&#8208;retention at 3 A&#183;g&#8722;1 (150C) is 97% after 1000 cycles and 68% after 10000 cycles. The charge/discharge time is about 24 seconds at 3.0 A&#183;g&#8722;1 with an energy density of about 49 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 6864 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 based on the cathode. A zinc activated&#8208;carbon ion&#8208;capacitor (coin cell) exhibits a operating&#8208;voltage window of 2.5 V, an energy density of 96 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 with a power density of 610 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 A&#183;g&#8722;1. At 12 A&#183;g&#8722;1, 36 Wh&#183;kg&#8722;1 and 13600 W&#183;kg&#8722;1 are achieved with 90% capacity retention and an average CE of 96% over 10000 cycles. Quantum&#8208;chemical methods and vibrational spectroscopy revealed [Zn(bet)2(AN)2]2+ as the dominant complex in the electrolyte.

         <title>Transcranial Non&#8208;genetic Neuromodulation Via Bioinspired Vesicle&#8208;Enabled Precise NIR&#8208;II Optical&#8208;stimulation</title>

Abstract
Regulating the activity of specific neurons is essentially important in neurocircuit dissection and neuropathy therapy. As a recently developed strategy, nanomaterial&#8208;enabled non&#8208;genetic neuromodulations that realize remote physical stimuli have made vast progress and shown great clinical potential. However, minimal invasiveness and high spatiotemporal resolution are still challenging for non&#8208;genetic neuromodulation. Herein, we report a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light&#8208;induced transcranial non&#8208;genetic neurostimulation via bioinspired nano&#8208;vesicles. The rationally designed vesicles are obtained from vesicle membrane&#8208;confined enzymatic reactions. This study demonstrates that the vesicle&#8208;enabled NIR&#8208;II photothermal stimuli can elicit neuronal signaling dynamics with precise spatiotemporal control and thus evoke defined neural circuits in non&#8208;transgenic mice. Moreover, the vesicle&#8208;mediated NIR&#8208;II optical stimulation can regulate mouse motor behaviors with minimal invasiveness by eliminating light&#8208;emitting implants. Furthermore, the biological modulation is integrated with photoacoustic brain imaging, realizing navigational and efficient neuromodulation. Such transcranial and precise NIR&#8208;II optical neuromodulation mediated by bioinspired vesicles shows the potential for the optical&#8208;theranostics of neurological diseases in non&#8208;transgenic organisms.

         <title>Taming Solvent&#8211;Solute Interaction Accelerates Interfacial Kinetics in Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal batteries promise energy density beyond 400 Wh kg&#8722;1, while their practical operation at an extreme temperature below &#8722;30&#176;C suffers severe capacity deterioration. Such battery failure highly relates to the remarkably increased kinetic barrier of interfacial processes, including interfacial desolvation, ion transportation, and charge transfer. In this contribution, the interfacial kinetics in three prototypical electrolytes are quantitatively probed by three&#8208;electrode electrochemical techniques and molecular dynamics simulations. Desolvation as the limiting step of interfacial processes is validated to dominate the cell impedance and capacity at low temperature. 1,3&#8208;dioxolane&#8208;based electrolyte with tamed solvent&#8211;solute interaction facilitates fast desolvation, enabling the practical Li | LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cells at &#8722;40&#176;C to retain 66% retention of room&#8208;temperature capacity and withstand remarkably fast charging rate (0.3 C). The barrier of desolvation dictated by solvent&#8211;solute interaction environments has been quantitatively uncovered. Regulating the solvent&#8211;solute interaction by low&#8208;affinity solvents emerges as a promising solution to low&#8208;temperature batteries.

         <title>Tailored Polypeptide Star Copolymers for 3D Printing of Bacterial Composites Via Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hydrogels hold much promise for 3&#8208;D printing of functional living materials, however challenges remain in tailoring mechanical robustness as well as biological performance. In addressing this challenge, we describe the modular synthesis of functional hydrogels from 3&#8208;arm diblock copolypeptide stars composed of an inner poly(L&#8208;glutamate) domain and outer poly(L&#8208;tyrosine) or poly(L&#8208;valine) blocks. Physical crosslinking due to &#223;&#8208;sheet assembly of these star block copolymers gives mechanical stability during extrusion printing and the selective incorporation of methacrylate units allows for subsequent photocrosslinking to occur under biocompatible conditions. This permits direct ink write (DIW) printing of bacteria&#8208;based mixtures leading to 3D objects with high fidelity and excellent bacterial viability. The tunable stiffness of different copolypeptide networks enables control over proliferation and colony formation for embedded E.coli bacteria as demonstrated via isopropyl &#223;&#8208;D&#8208;1&#8208;thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) induction of green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression. This translation of molecular structure to network properties highlights the versatility of these polypeptide hydrogel systems with the combination of writable structures and biological activity illustrating the future potential of these 3D printed biocomposites.

         <title>A Demulsification&#8208;Crystallization Model for High&#8208;Quality Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A room&#8208;temperature technique with all&#8208;nonpolar&#8208;solvent, which circumvents the sensitivity of ionic perovskite to polar solvent, has become attractive for the synthesis of metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PNCs). However, the lack of understanding of the inner mechanism, especially for the state of the precursor and the crystallization process of the PNCs, hinders further development of this technique. Here, through systematic study of the Pb precursor and in&#8208;situ characterization of the PNCs, we reveal that the reverse micelle nature of the Pb precursor exactly creates a novel demulsification&#8208;crystallization (D&#8211;C) model, namely, a two&#8208;stage nucleation is divided by a demulsification process for the PNCs. On the basis, a top efficiency for green light&#8208;emitting diodes based on PNCs is obtained with a maximum external quantum efficiency of 22.5% through tailoring the D&#8211;C model using a multiple&#8208;acid&#8208;anion synergistic assisted strategy to obtain high&#8208;quality PNCs. Beyond the high efficiency, our work paves the way for diverse ideas in PNC synthesis.

         <title>Surface Doping Induced Mobility Modulation Effect for Transport Enhancement in Organic Single Crystal Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular doping has conventionally been an effective way to improve the electrical transport performances in organic field effect transistors (OFETs), while corresponding mechanisms associated with specific doping techniques have been less investigated and discussed in detail. Here, based on ultra&#8208;thin DNTT single crystals we realized robust transconductance enhancements in OFETs upon surface molecular doping realized via van der Waals epitaxially growing crystalline F6TCNNQ onto the single crystal's surface. We proposed that, it is the mobility modulation effect (MME) from the interactions between charge transfer interface and gate electric field, that contributes to more weighted bulk carriers, and finally improve charge transport performances. The evaluations were further supported by SKPM's surface potential characterizations, which manifested the gate induced more delocalized holes near the charge transfer interfaces. SCLC investigations, numerical calculations, and theoretical mobility modeling were also performed to corroborate the analysis. This study could deepen the understanding of charge transport in doped semiconductors and provide effective ways for optimizing the electrical performance of organic devices.

         <title>Hybrid Block Copolymer/Perovskite Heterointerfaces for Efficient Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solution processable semiconductors like organics and emerging lead halide perovskites (LHPs) are ideal candidates for photovoltaics combining high performance and flexibility with reduced manufacturing cost. Moreover, the study of hybrid semiconductors would lead to advanced structures and deep understanding that will propel this field even further. Herein, we investigate a novel device architecture involving block copolymer/perovskite hybrid bulk heterointerfaces, such a modification could enhance light absorption, create an energy level cascade and provides a thin hydrophobic layer, thus enabling enhanced carrier generation, promoting energy transfer and preventing moisture invasion, respectively. The resulting hybrid block copolymer/perovskite solar cell exhibits a champion efficiency of 24.07% for 0.0725 cm2&#8208;sized devices and 21.44% for 1 cm2&#8208;sized devices, respectively, together with enhanced stability, which is among the highest reports of organic/perovskite hybrid devices. More importantly, this approach has been effectively extended to other LHPs with different chemical compositions like MAPbI3 and CsPbI3, which may shed light on the design of highly efficient block copolymer/perovskite hybrid materials and architectures that would overcome current limitations for realistic application exploration.

         <title>Lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 Organic Framework Scintillators Sensitized by Cluster&#8208;based Antenna for High&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray Imaging</title>

Abstract
Scintillator based X&#8208;ray imaging has attracted great attention from industrial quality inspection and security to medical diagnostics. Herein, a series of lanthanide(III)&#8208;Cu4I4 heterometallic organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs) based X&#8208;ray scintillators were developed by rationally assembling X&#8208;ray absorption centers ([Cu4I4] clusters) and luminescent chromophores (Ln(III) ions) in a specific manner. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, the heavy inorganic units ([Cu4I4] clusters) absorbed the X&#8208;ray energy to populate triplet excitons via the halide&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (XLCT) combined with metal&#8208;to&#8208;ligand charge transfer (MLCT) state (defined X/MLCT state), and then the 3X/MLCT excited state sensitized Tb3+ for intense X&#8208;ray excited luminescence via excitation energy transfer. The obtained Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs scintillators exhibited high resistance to humidity and radiation, excellent linear response to X&#8208;ray dose rate and high X&#8208;ray relative light yield of 29379 &#177; 3000 photons MeV&#8722;1. The relative light yield of Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs was about 3 times higher than that of control Tb(III) complex. X&#8208;ray imaging tests showed that Tb&#8208;Cu4I4 MOFs based flexible scintillator film exhibited a high spatial resolution of 12.6 lp mm&#8722;1. These findings not only provided a promising design strategy to develop lanthanide MOFs based scintillators with excellent scintillation performance, but also exhibited high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging for biological specimen and electronic chip.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Halide Exchange of Cesium Lead Halide Perovskites for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional (3D) perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep&#8208;blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), which is required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskite&#8208;based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep&#8208;blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in&#8208;situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep&#8208;blue 3D perovskites by spin&#8208;coating organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide&#8208;exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusions targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed&#8208;halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high&#8208;quality deep&#8208;blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep&#8208;blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1,680&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, we can achieve blue perovskite LEDs with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.

&lt;p&gt;Three-dimensional (3D) perovskites are promising to achieve efficient and bright deep-blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs), which is required for lighting and display applications. However, the efficiency of deep-blue 3D perovskite-based LEDs is limited by high density of defects in perovskites, and their deep-blue emission is not easy to achieve due to the halide phase separation and low solubility of chloride in precursor solutions. Here, an in-situ halide exchange method is developed to achieve deep-blue 3D perovskites by spin-coating organic halide salts solution to treat blue 3D perovskites. It is revealed that the halide-exchange process is mainly determined by halide ion diffusions targeting a concentration equalization, which leads to homogeneous 3D mixed-halide perovskites. By further introducing multifunctional organic ammonium halide salts into the exchange solution to passivate defects, high-quality deep-blue perovskites with reduced trap density can be obtained. This approach leads to efficient deep-blue perovskite LEDs with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 4.6% and a luminance of 1,680&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which show color coordinates of (0.131, 0.055), very close to the Rec. 2020 blue standard. Moreover, the halide exchange method is bidirectional, we can achieve blue perovskite LEDs with color coordinates of (0.095, 0.160), exhibiting a high EQE of 11.3%.&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Advances in Solution&#8208;processed OLEDs and their Prospects for Use in Displays</title>

Abstract
This review outlines problems and progress in development of solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SOLEDs) in industry and academia. Solution processing has several advantages such as low consumption of materials, low&#8208;cost processing, and large&#8208;area manufacturing. However, use of a solution process entails complications, such the needs for solvent resistivity and solution&#8208;processable materials, and yields SOLEDs that have limited luminous efficiency, severe roll&#8208;off characteristics, and short lifetime compared to OLEDs fabricated using thermal evaporation. These demerits impede production of practical SOLED displays. This review outlines the industrial demands for commercial SOLEDs and the current status of SOLED development in industries and academia, and presents research guidelines for development of SOLEDs that have high efficiency, long lifetime, good processability to achieve commercialization.

         <title>Emergent Magnetic States and Tunable Exchange Bias at 3d Nitride Heterointerfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfacial magnetism stimulates the discovery of giant magnetoresistance and spin&#8208;orbital coupling across the heterointerfaces, facilitating the intimate correlation between spin transport and complex magnetic structures. Over decades, functional heterointerfaces composed of nitrides have been seldomly explored due to the difficulty in synthesizing high&#8208;quality nitride films with correct compositions. Here we report the fabrication of single&#8208;crystalline ferromagnetic Fe3N thin films with precisely controlled thicknesses. As film thickness decreased, the magnetization dramatically deteriorated, and the electronic state changed from metallic to insulating. Strikingly, the high&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism was maintained in a Fe3N layer with a thickness down to 2 u. c. (&#8764;8 &#197;). The magnetoresistance exhibited a strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy; meanwhile, the anomalous Hall resistance reserved its sign when Fe3N layer thickness exceeded 5 u. c. Furthermore, we observed a sizable exchange bias at the interfaces between a ferromagnetic Fe3N and an antiferromagnetic CrN. The exchange bias field and saturation moment strongly depended on the controllable bending curvature using the cylinder diameter engineering technique, implying the tunable magnetic states under lattice deformation. This work provides a guideline for exploring functional nitride films and applying their interfacial phenomena for innovative perspectives toward practical applications.

         <title>Long&#8208;Life Regenerated LiFePO4 from Spent Cathode by Elevating the d&#8208;Band Center of Fe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A large amount of spent LiFePO4 (LFP) are produced in recent years because it is one of the most widely used cathode materials for electric vehicles. The traditional hydrometallurgical and pyrometallurgical recycling methods are doubted because of economic and environmental benefits, direct regeneration method is considered a promising way to recycle spent LFP. However, the performance of regenerated LFP by the direct recycling method is generally not ideal due to the migration of iron (Fe) ions during cycling and irreversible phase transition caused by sluggish lithium ion (Li+) diffusion. The key to addressing the challenge is to immobilize Fe atoms in the lattice and improve the Li+ migration capability during cycling. Here, we effectively regenerated spent LFP by using environment&#8208;friendly ethanol and promoted its cycling stability by elevating the d&#8208;band center of Fe atoms via constructing a heterogeneous interface between LFP and nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon. The Fe&#8208;O bonding is strengthened and the migration of Fe ions during cycling is suppressed due to the elevated d&#8208;band center. The diffusion kinetics of Li+ in regenerated LFP were improved, leading to an excellent reversibility of the phase transition. Therefore, the cell with a regenerated LFP cathode exhibits an ultra&#8208;stable cycling performance at a high rate of 10 C with &#8764;80% capacity retention after 1000 cycles.

         <title>Fluorination enhances NIR&#8208;II emission and photothermal conversion efficiency of phototheranostic agents for imaging&#8208;guided cancer therapy</title>

Abstract
Phototheranostics with second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) imaging and photothermal effect have become a burgeoning biotechnology for tumor diagnosis and precise treatment. As important parameters of phototheranostic agents (PTAs), fluorescence quantum yield (QY) and photothermal conversion efficiency (PCE) are usually considered as a pair of contradictions that is difficult to be simultaneously enhanced. Herein, a fluorination strategy for designing A&#8208;D&#8208;A type PTAs with synchronously improved QY and PCE is proposed. Experiment results show that the molar extinction coefficient (&#949;), NIR&#8208;II QY and PCE of all fluorinated PTAs nanoparticles (NPs) are definitely improved compared with the chlorinated counterparts. Theoretical calculation results demonstrate that fluorination can maximize the electrostatic potential difference by virtue of high electronegativity of fluorine, which may increase intra/intermolecular D&#8208;A interactions, tighten molecule packing and further promote the increase of &#949;, ultimately leading to simultaneously enhanced QY and PCE. In these PTA NPs, FY6&#8208;NPs display NIR&#8208;II emission extended to 1400&#160;nm with the highest NIR&#8208;II QY (4.2%) and PCE (80%). These features make FY6&#8208;NPs perform well in high&#8208;resolution imaging of vasculature and NIR&#8208;II imaging&#8208;guided photothermal therapy (PTT) of tumor. This study develops a valuable guideline for constructing NIR&#8208;II organic PTAs with high performances.

         <title>Phosphorous Dendron Micelles as a Nanomedicine Platform for Cooperative Tumor Chemoimmunotherapy via Synergistic Modulation of Immune Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Design of effective nanomedicines to modulate multiple immune cells to overcome the immune&#8208;suppressive tumor microenvironment is desirable to improve the overall poor clinical outcomes of immunotherapy. Herein, we report a nanomedicine platform based on chemotherapeutic drug doxorubicin (DOX)&#8208;loaded phosphorus dendron micelles (M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX, TBP, tyramine bearing two dimethylphosphonate) with inherent immunomodulatory activity for synergistic tumor chemoimmunotherapy. The M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa@DOX micelles with good stability and a mean particle size of 86.4 nm can deliver DOX to solid tumors to induce significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death (ICD). With the demonstrated intrinsic activity of M&#8208;G1&#8208;TBPNa that can promote the proliferation of natural killer (NK) cells, the ICD&#8208;resulted maturation of dendritic cells of the DOX&#8208;loaded micelles, and the combination of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody, we demonstrate the synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation, recruitment of tumor&#8208;infiltrating NK cells and cytotoxic T cells, and decrease of regulatory T cells for effective tumor chemoimmunotherapy with strong antitumor immunity and immune memory effect for effective prevention of lung metastasis. The developed phosphorous dendron micelles may hold great promise to be used as an advanced nanomedicine formulation for synergistic modulation of multiple immune cells through NK cell proliferation for effective chemoimmunotherapy of different tumor types.

         <title>Large Magneto&#8208;transverse and Longitudinal Thermoelectric Effects in the Magnetic Weyl Semimetal TbPtBi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Magnetic topological semimetals provide new opportunities for power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling based on thermoelectric (TE) effect. The interplay between magnetism and nontrivial bands topology prompts the magnetic topological semimetals to yield strong transverse thermoelectric effect, while the longitudinal TE performance is usually poor. Herein, we demonstrate that the magnetic Weyl semimetal TbPtBi has high value for both transverse and longitudinal thermopower with large power factor (PF). At 300 K and 13.5 Tesla, the transverse thermopower and PF reach up to 214 &#956;V K&#8722;1 and 35 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, respectively, which are comparable to those of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art TE materials. Combining first&#8208;principles calculations, longitudinal magnetoresistance and planar Hall resistance measurements, and two&#8208;band model fitting, we attribute the large transverse thermopower and PF to both bipolar effect and large Hall angle. Moreover, the imperfectly compensated charge carriers and large transverse magnetoresistance induce the maximum magneto&#8208;longitudinal thermopower of 251 &#956;V K&#8722;1 with a PF of 24 &#956;W cm&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 at 150 K and 13.5 Tesla, which is two times higher than that at zero magnetic field. This work demonstrates the great potential of topological semimetals for TEs and offers a new excellent candidate for magneto&#8208;TEs.

Abstract
The detection and monitoring of ultra&#8208;low humidity (&lt;100&#160;ppm) are critical in many important industries, such as high&#8208;tech manufacturing, scientific research, and aerospace. However, the development of ppm&#8208;level humidity sensors with portability, low cost, and ease of regeneration remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy is proposed to address this problem by employing suitable molecular&#8208;level humidity&#8208;sensitive units and chemically constructing a multilevel spatial synergistic sensitization microenvironment around it. The as&#8208;prepared ultra&#8208;low humidity&#8208;sensitive paper (UHSP) achieved a naked&#8208;eye recognition humidity of 0.01&#8211;100&#160;ppm. UHSP not only is simple to prepare, handy, and low&#8208;cost, but can also be simply and efficiently regenerated as well as recycled many times by skillfully utilizing the &#8220;unconventional sublimation&#8221; and &#8220;lime slaked&#8221; of calcium oxide. The molecular reaction mechanisms involved in the humidity response and regeneration of UHSP have been demonstrated in detail. UHSP can provide a promising new method for ultra&#8208;low humidity detection in the form of portable kits or sirens. The demonstrated &#8220;enzyme&#8208;like&#8221; construction strategy could bring unlimited ideas and implications to the design and development of sensors with tunable response thresholds, particularly high sensitivity.

         <title>Emergent, Non&#8208;Aging, Extendable, and Rechargeable Exchange Bias in Two&#8208;Dimensional Fe3GeTe2 Homostructures Induced by Moderate Pressuring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a crucial concept in magnetism and spintronics, exchange bias (ExB) measures the asymmetry in the hysteresis loop of a pinned ferromagnet (FM)/antiferromagnet (AFM) interface. Previous studies were mainly focused on FM/AFM heterostructures composed of conventional bulk materials whose complex interfaces prohibit precise control and full understanding of the phenomenon. Here we exploit the enabling power of two&#8208;dimensional magnets to demonstrate the emergence, non&#8208;aging, extendability, and rechargeability of ExB in van der Waals Fe3GeTe2 homostructures upon moderate pressuring. The emergence of the ExB is attributed to a local stress&#8208;induced FM&#8208;to&#8208;AFM transition, as validated using first&#8208;principles calculations and confirmed in magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect and second harmonic generation measurements. We also observe negligible ExB aging before the training effect suddenly takes place through avalanching, pronounced delay of the avalanche via timed pressure repetition (extendability), ExB recovery in the post&#8208;training sample upon refreshed pressuring (rechargeability), and demonstrate its versatile tunability. These striking findings offer unprecedented insights into the underlying principles of ExB and its training, with immense technological applications in sight.

Abstract
Polymer&#8208;inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI&#8208;JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI&#8208;JNPs remains challenging. Herein, we report the construction of a novel Janus Au&#8208;porphyrin polymersome (J&#8208;AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one&#8208;step photocatalytic synthesis. The near&#8208;field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J&#8208;AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near&#8208;infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improve the energy transfer and energetic charge carrier generation. Therefore, J&#8208;AuPPS shows a higher NIR&#8208;activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non&#8208;Janus core&#8208;particle Au&#8208;PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J&#8208;AuPPS exhibits excellent dual&#8208;mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and antibiofilm performance and thereby significantly enhances in vivo therapeutic effect on the implant&#8208;associated infection rat model. We believe this work will motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid Janus nanoparticles with the desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer-inorganic hybrid Janus nanoparticles (PI-JNPs) have attracted extensive attention due to their special structures and functions. However, achieving the synergistic enhancement of photochemical activity between polymer and inorganic moieties in PI-JNPs remains challenging. Herein, we report the construction of a novel Janus Au-porphyrin polymersome (J-AuPPS) heterostructure by a facile one-step photocatalytic synthesis. The near-field enhancement (NFE) effect between porphyrin polymersome (PPS) and Au nanoparticles in J-AuPPS is achieved to enhance its near-infrared (NIR) light absorption and electric/thermal field intensity at their interface, which improve the energy transfer and energetic charge carrier generation. Therefore, J-AuPPS shows a higher NIR-activated photothermal conversion efficiency (48.4%) and generates more singlet oxygen compared with non-Janus core-particle Au-PPS nanostructure (28.4%). As a result, J-AuPPS exhibits excellent dual-mode (photothermal/photodynamic) antibacterial and antibiofilm performance and thereby significantly enhances in vivo therapeutic effect on the implant-associated infection rat model. We believe this work will motivate the rational design of advanced hybrid Janus nanoparticles with the desirable NFE effect and further extend their biological applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atomically Flat, 2D Edge Directed Self&#8208;Assembly of Block Copolymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanoscale shape engineering is an essential requirement for the practical use of two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials, aiming at precisely customizing optimal structures and properties. Herein, sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm scale block copolymer (BCP) self&#8208;assembled nanopatterns finely aligned along the atomic edge of 2D flakes, including graphene, MoS2, and h&#8208;BN, are exploited for reliable nanopatterning of 2D materials. The underlying mechanism for the alignment of the self&#8208;assembled nanodomains was elucidated based on the wetting layer alternation of the BCP film in the presence of intermediate 2D flakes. The resultant highly aligned nanocylinder templates with remarkably low levels of line edge roughness (LER) and line&#8208;width roughness (LWR) yield a sub&#8208;10&#8208;nm wide graphene nanoribbon (GNR) array with noticeable switching characteristics (on&#8208;to&#8208;off ratio up to &#8764; 6 &#215; 104).

         <title>Bifacial dye membranes: ultrathin and free&#8208;standing although not being covalently bound</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Layers of aligned dyes are key to photo&#8208;driven charge separation in dye sensitized solar cells, but cannot be exploited as rectifying membranes in photocatalysis to separate half&#8208;cells because they are not sufficiently stable. While impressive work on the fabrication of stable noncovalent membranes has been recently demonstrated, these membranes are inherently suffering from non&#8208;uniform orientation of the constituting dyes. To stabilize layers made from uniformly assembled and aligned dyes, they can be covalently cross&#8208;linked via functional groups or via chromophores at the expense of their optical properties. Here we report stable membranes from established dyes that do not need to be elaborately functionalized nor do their chromophores need to be destroyed. These membranes are free&#8208;standing, although being only non&#8208;covalently linked. To enable uniform dye&#8208;alignment, we used Langmuir layers made from linear, water&#8208;insoluble dyes. We demonstrate that water&#8208;soluble charge transfer dyes adsorb onto and intercalate into the Langmuir layer from the aqueous subphase, thus yielding free&#8208;standing, molecularly thin membranes. The developed bifacial layers consist almost entirely of &#960;&#8208;conjugated units and thus can conduct charges and can be further engineered for optoelectronic and photocatalytic applications.

         <title>Enhancing Electron Correlation at a 3d Ferromagnetic Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
We combine spin&#8208;resolved momentum microscopy and theoretical calculations beyond the one&#8208;electron approximation to unveil the spin&#8208;dependent electronic structure of the interface formed between iron and an ordered oxygen atomic layer, and find an adsorbate&#8208;induced enhancement of electronic correlations. We demonstrate that this enhancement is responsible for a drastic narrowing of the Fe d&#8208;bands close to the Fermi energy and a reduction of the exchange splitting, that is not accounted for in the Stoner picture of ferromagnetism. In addition, correlation leads to a significant spin&#8208;dependent broadening of the electronic bands at higher binding energies and their merging with satellite features, that are manifestations of a pure many&#8208;electron behavior. Overall, adatom adsorption can be used to vary the material parameters of transition metal surfaces to access different intermediate electronic correlated regimes, which would otherwise not be accessible. Our results show that the concepts developed to understand the physics and chemistry of adsorbate&#8208;metal interfaces, relevant for a variety of research areas, from spintronics to catalysis, need to be reconsidered with many&#8208;particle effects being of utmost importance. These may affect chemisorption energy, spin transport, magnetic order, and even play a key role in the emergence of ferromagnetism at interfaces between non&#8208;magnetic systems.

         <title>All&#8208;Liquid Reconfigurable Electronics Using Jammed MXene Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rigid, solid&#8208;state components represent the current paradigm for electronic systems, but they lack post&#8208;production reconfigurability and pose ever&#8208;increasing challenges to efficient end&#8208;of&#8208;life recycling. Liquid electronics may overcome these limitations by offering flexible in&#8208;the&#8208;field redesign and separation at end&#8208;of&#8208;life via simple liquid phase chemistries. Up to now, preliminary work on liquid electronics has focused on liquid metal components, but these devices still require an encapsulating polymer and typically use alloys of rare elements like indium. Here, using the self&#8208;assembly of jammed two&#8208;dimensional titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene nanoparticles at liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces, we describe &#8220;all&#8208;liquid&#8221; electrically conductive sheets, wires, and simple functional devices including electromechanical switches and photodetectors. These assemblies combine the high conductivity of MXene nanosheets with the controllable form and reconfigurability of structured liquids. Such configurations could have applications not only in electronics, but also in catalysis and microfluidics, especially in systems where the product and substrate have affinity for solvents of differing polarity.

         <title>Multiscale Reciprocal Space Mapping of Magnetite Mesocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Mesocrystals are the class of nanostructured material, where multiple&#8208;length&#8208;scale structure is a prerequisite of many interesting phenomena. Resolving the mesocrystal structure is quite challenging due to their structuration on different length scales. The combination of SAXS and WAXS (small&#8208; and wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering) techniques offers the possibility to non&#8208;destructively probe mesocrystalline structures simultaneously over multiple length scales to reveal their microscopic structure. This work describes how high dynamical range of modern detectors sheds light on the weak features of scattering, significantly increasing the information content. We describe the detailed analysis of X&#8208;ray diffraction from the magnetite mesocrystals with different particle size and shapes &#8211; in tandem with the electron microscopy. The revealed features provide valuable input to the models of mesocrystal growth and the choice of structural motif; the impact on magnetic properties is discussed.

Abstract
Incorporating large organic cations to form two&#8208;dimensional (2D) and mixed 2D/3D structures significantly increases the stability of perovskite solar cells. However, due to their low electron mobility, aligning the organic sheets to ensure unimpeded charge transport is critical to rival the high performances of pure 3D systems. While additives such as methylammonium chloride (MACl) can enable this preferential orientation, so far, no complete description exists explaining how they influence the nucleation process to grow highly aligned crystals. Here, by investigating the initial stages of the crystallization, as well as partially and fully formed perovskites grown using MACl, the origins underlying this favorable alignment are inferred. This mechanism is studied by employing 3&#8208;fluorobenzylammonium in quasi&#8208;2D perovskite solar cells. Upon assisting the crystallization with MACl, films with a degree of preferential orientation of 94%, capable of withstanding moisture levels of 97% RH for 10&#160;h without significant changes in the crystal structure are achieved. Finally, by combining macroscopic, microscopic, and spectroscopic studies, the nucleation process leading to highly oriented perovskite films is elucidated. Understanding this mechanism will aid in the rational design of future additives to achieve more defect tolerant and stable perovskite optoelectronics.

Abstract
Artificial neural networks based on crossbar arrays of analog programmable resistors could address the high energy challenge of conventional hardware in artificial intelligence applications. However, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art two&#8208;terminal resistive switching devices based on conductive filament formation suffer from high variability and poor controllability. Electrochemical ionic synapses are three&#8208;terminal devices that operate by electrochemical and dynamic insertion/extraction of ions that control the electronic conductivity of a channel in a single solid&#8208;solution phase. They are promising candidates for programmable resistors in crossbar arrays because they have shown uniform and deterministic control of electronic conductivity based on ion doping, with very low energy consumption. In this review, the desirable specifications of these programmable resistors are presented. Then an overview of the current progress of devices based on Li+, O2&#8722; and H+ ions and material systems is provided. Achieving nanosecond speed, low operation voltage (&#8764;1&#160;V), low energy consumption, with CMOS compatibility all simultaneously remains a challenge. Towards this goal, we have constructed a physical model of the device to provide guidelines for the desired material properties to overcome the remaining challenges. Finally, an outlook is provided, including strategies to advance materials towards the desirable properties and the future opportunities for electrochemical ionic synapses.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Multilevel Hollow Phenolic Resin Nanoreactors with Precise Metal Nanoparticles Spatial Location toward Promising Heterogeneous Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanoscale chemical surgery is reported on phenolic resins based on a dissolution and repolymerization procedure, to construct multilevel hollow structures with well&#8208;defined functional groups. Those special architectures are useful in the fabrication of novel nanomaterials, Au@APF composites, with Au nanoparticles fully embedded within the spheres, which are well suited to architect the bimetallic catalyst with remarkable hydrogenation activity.








Abstract
Hollow nanostructures with fascinating properties have inspired numerous interests in broad research fields. Cell&#8208;mimicking complex hollow architectures with precise active components distributions are particularly important, while their synthesis remains highly challenging. Herein, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; chemical surgery strategy is introduced to engrave the 3&#8208;aminophenol formaldehyde resin (APF) spheres at nanoscale. Undergoing the cleavage of (Ar)C&#63743;N bonds with ethanol as chemical scissors and subsequent repolymerization process, the Solid APF transform to multilevel hollow architecture with precise nanospatial distribution of organic functional groups (e.g., hydroxymethyl and amine). The transformation is tracked by electron microscopy and solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance&#160;techniques, the category and dosage of alcohol are pivotal for constructing&#160;multilevel hollow structures. Moreover, it is demonstrated the evolution of nanostructures accompanied with unique organic microenvironments is able to accurately confine multiple gold (Au) nanoparticles, leading to the formation of pomegranate&#8208;like particles. Through selectively depositing palladium (Pd) nanoparticles onto the outer shell, bimetallic Au@APF@Pd catalysts are formed, which exhibit excellent hydrogenation performance with turnover frequency (TOF) value up to 11257&#160;h&#8211;1. This work provides an effective method for precisely manipulating the nanostructure and composition of polymers at nanoscale and sheds light on the design of catalysts with precise spatial active components.

         <title>Intrinsic (Trap&#8208;Free) Transistors Based on Epitaxial Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic (trap&#8208;free) field&#8208;effect transistors based on epitaxial single&#8208;crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films are reported. Extensive structural, electrical, and gated Hall&#8208;effect characterization confirms outstanding quality of the material and a nearly ideal transistor behavior. Hole mobility of 30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature, monotonically increasing on cooling to 250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, is measured in these transistors.








Abstract
The first experimental realization of the intrinsic (not dominated by defects) charge conduction regime in lead&#8208;halide perovskite field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) is reported. The advance is enabled by: i) a new vapor&#8208;phase epitaxy technique that results in large&#8208;area single&#8208;crystalline cesium lead bromide (CsPbBr3) films with excellent structural and surface properties, including atomically flat surface morphology, essentially free from defects and traps at the level relevant to device operation; ii) an extensive materials analysis of these films using a variety of thin&#8208;film and surface probes certifying the chemical and structural quality of the material; and iii) the fabrication of nearly ideal (trap&#8208;free) FETs with characteristics superior to any reported to date. These devices allow the investigation of the intrinsic FET and (gated) Hall&#8208;effect carrier mobilities as functions of temperature. The intrinsic mobility is found to increase on cooling from &#8776;30 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature to &#8776;250 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at 50 K, revealing a band transport limited by phonon scattering. Establishing the intrinsic (phonon&#8208;limited) mobility provides a solid test for theoretical descriptions of carrier transport in perovskites, reveals basic limits to the technology, and points to a path for future high&#8208;performance perovskite electronic devices.

         <title>Doping Engineering in the MoS2/SnSe2 Heterostructure toward High&#8208;Rejection&#8208;Ratio Solar&#8208;Blind UV Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The staggered large band offset heterojunction based on MoS2 and SnSe2 is an ideal structure for the separation of photogenerated carriers. Combined with doping engineering, a photodetector based on the doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure exhibits excellent solar&#8208;blind UV photoresponse ability compared to the pure MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructure. The rejection ratio is significantly improved by about five orders of magnitude.








Abstract
The intentionally designed band alignment of heterostructures and doping engineering are keys to implement device structure design and device performance optimization. According to the theoretical prediction of several typical materials among the transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) and group&#8208;IV metal chalcogenides, MoS2 and SnSe2 present the largest staggered band offset. The large band offset is conducive to the separation of photogenerated carriers, thus MoS2/SnSe2 is a theoretically ideal candidate for fabricating photodetector, which is also verified in the experiment. Furthermore, in order to extend the photoresponse spectrum to solar&#8208;blind ultraviolet (SBUV), doping engineering is adopted to form an additional electron state, which provides an extra carrier transition channel. In this work, pure MoS2/SnSe2 and doped MoS2/SnSe2 heterostructures are both fabricated. In terms of the photoelectric performance evaluation, the rejection ratio R254/R532 of the photodetector based on doped MoS2/SnSe2 is five orders of magnitude higher than that of pure MoS2/SnSe2, while the response time is obviously optimized by 3 orders. The results demonstrate that the combination of band alignment and doping engineering provides a new pathway for constructing SBUV photodetectors.

         <title>Hydro/Organo/Ionogels: &#8220;Controllable&#8221; Electromagnetic Wave Absorbers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;in&#8208;one strategy of the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and diverse liquids with strong absorption properties is proposed. These gels show a comprehensive controllability from composition, microstructure, and dielectric properties to electromagnetic wave absorption properties, offering a conceptually novel platform to develop customizable and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.








Abstract
Demand for electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorbers continues to increase with technological advances in wearable electronics and military applications. In this study, a new strategy to overcome the drawbacks of current absorbers by employing the co&#8208;contribution of functional polymer frameworks and liquids with strong EMW absorption properties is proposed. Strongly polar water, dimethyl sulfoxide/water mixtures, and highly conductive 1&#8208;ethyl&#8208;3&#8208;methylimidazolium ethyl sulfate ([EMI][ES]) are immobilized in dielectrically inert polymer networks to form different classes of gels (hydrogels, organogels, and ionogels). These gels demonstrate a high correlation between their dielectric properties and polarity/ionic conductivity/non&#8208;covalent interaction of immobilized liquids. Thus, the EMW absorption performances of the gels can be precisely tuned over a wide range due to the diversity and stability of the liquids. The prepared hydrogels show good shielding performance (shielding efficiency &gt; 20&#160;dB) due to the high dielectric constants, while organogels with moderate attenuation ability and impedance matching achieve full&#8208;wave absorption in X&#8208;band (8.2&#8211;12.4&#160;GHz) at 2.5 &#177; 0.5&#160;mm. The ionogels also offer a wide effective absorption bandwidth (10.79&#8211;16.38&#160;GHz at 2.2&#160;mm) via prominent ionic conduction loss. In short, this work provides a conceptually novel platform to develop high&#8208;efficient, customizable, and low&#8208;cost functional absorbers.

         <title>Multifaceted Catalytic ROS&#8208;Scavenging via Electronic Modulated Metal Oxides for Regulating Stem Cell Fate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electronic modulated metal oxide via Mn&#8208;atom substitutions in Co3O4 (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) is synthesized for reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging and regulating stem cells fates. The experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays excellent intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which can efficiently protect mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) from ROS attack, reverse the apoptotic fates, and rescue their functions in oxidative stress microenvironments.








Abstract
Developing reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;scavenging nanostructures to protect and regulate stem cells has emerged as an intriguing strategy for promoting tissue regeneration, especially in trauma microenvironments or refractory wounds. Here, an electronic modulated metal oxide is developed via Mn atom substitutions in Co3O4 nanocrystalline (Mn&#8208;Co3O4) for highly efficient and multifaceted catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging to reverse the fates of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) in oxidative&#8208;stress microenvironments. Benefiting from the atomic Mn&#8208;substitution and charge transfer from Mn to Co, the Co site in Mn&#8208;Co3O4 displays an increased ratio of Co2+/Co3+ and improved redox properties, thus enhancing its intrinsic and broad&#8208;spectrum catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging activities, which surpasses most of the currently reported metal oxides. Consequently, the Mn&#8208;Co3O4 can efficiently protect the MSCs from ROS attack and rescue their functions, including adhesion, spreading, proliferation, and osteogenic differentiation. This work not only establishes an efficient material for catalytic ROS&#8208;scavenging in stem&#8208;cell&#8208;based therapeutics but also provides a new avenue to design biocatalytic metal oxides via modulation of electronic structure.

         <title>50C Fast&#8208;Charge Li&#8208;Ion Batteries using a Graphite Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrochemical kinetics for Li+ transport will be dramatically enhanced by the rational design of electrolytes with low &#916;Edsv of Li+, high ionic conductivities, as well as the ability to form thin and robust solid electrolyte interphase on the graphite surfaces. Following the criterion, 50C fast&#8208;charge Li&#8208;ion batteries using graphite anode are successfully developed.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ion batteries have made inroads into the electric vehicle market with high energy densities, yet they still suffer from slow kinetics limited by the graphite anode. Here, electrolytes enabling extreme fast charging (XFC) of a microsized graphite anode without Li plating are designed. Comprehensive characterization and simulations on the diffusion of Li+ in the bulk electrolyte, charge&#8208;transfer process, and the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) demonstrate that high ionic conductivity, low desolvation energy of Li+, and protective SEI are essential for XFC. Based on the criterion, two fast&#8208;charging electrolytes are designed: low&#8208;voltage 1.8&#160;m LiFSI in 1,3&#8208;dioxolane (for LiFePO4||graphite cells) and high&#8208;voltage 1.0&#160;m LiPF6 in a mixture of 4&#8208;fluoroethylene carbonate and acetonitrile (7:3 by vol) (for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells). The former electrolyte enables the graphite electrode to achieve 180 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50C (1C = 370 mAh g&#8722;1), which is 10 times higher than that of a conventional electrolyte. The latter electrolyte enables LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2||graphite cells (2 mAh cm&#8722;2, N/P ratio = 1) to provide a record&#8208;breaking reversible capacity of 170 mAh g&#8722;1 at 4C charge and 0.3C discharge. This work unveils the key mechanisms for XFC and provides instructive electrolyte design principles for practical fast&#8208;charging LIBs with graphite anodes.

The latter electrolyte enables LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||graphite cells (2 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, N/P ratio = 1) to provide a record-breaking reversible capacity of 170 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 4C charge and 0.3C discharge. This work unveils the key mechanisms for XFC and provides instructive electrolyte design principles for practical fast-charging LIBs with graphite anodes.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Black Phosphorous Mediates Surface Charge Redistribution of CoSe2 for Electrochemical H2O2 Production in Acidic Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Black phosphorus chemically nailed on metallic cobalt diselenide mediates surface charge redistribution, which enables a selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in acid. The catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 at an overpotential of 300 mV, and a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor.








Abstract
Electrochemical generation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) by two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction offers a green method to mitigate the current dependence on the energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process, promising its on&#8208;site applications. Unfortunately, in alkaline environments, H2O2 is not stable and undergoes rapid decomposition. Making H2O2 in acidic electrolytes can prevent its decomposition, but choices of active, stable, and selective electrocatalysts are significantly limited. Here, the selective and efficient two&#8208;electron reduction of oxygen toward H2O2 in acid by a composite catalyst that is composed of black phosphorus (BP) nailed chemically on the metallic cobalt diselenide (CoSe2) surface is reported. It is found that this catalyst exhibits a 91% Faradic efficiency for H2O2 product at an overpotential of 300 mV. Moreover, it can mediate oxygen to H2O2 with a high production rate of &#8776;1530&#160;mg L&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 in a flow&#8208;cell reactor. Spectroscopic and computational studies together uncover a BP&#8208;induced surface charge redistribution in CoSe2, which leads to a favorable surface electronic structure that weakens the HOO* adsorption, thus enhancing the kinetics toward H2O2 formation.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Zirconium&#8208;Based Perovskites for Large&#8208;Area and Ultraflexible X&#8208;ray Scintillator Screens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6 is employed to fabricate large&#8208;area flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens. Joint experiment&#8211;theory characterizations indicate the broadband emission of Cs2ZrCl6 originates from the triplet emission of self&#8208;trapped excitons. The thermally activated delayed fluorescence feature of Cs2ZrCl6 provides a large Stokes shift and supports luminescence collection. The flexible scintillator screen achieves high&#8208;quality imaging of non&#8208;flat and dynamic objects.








Abstract
Flexible scintillator screens with environmental stability, high sensitivity, and low cost have emerged as candidates for X&#8208;ray imaging applications. Here, a large&#8208;scale and cost&#8208;efficient solution synthesis of the vacancy&#8208;ordered double perovskite Cs2ZrCl6, which is characterized by thermal activation delayed fluorescence (TADF) dominated by triplet emission under X&#8208;ray irradiation, is demonstrated. The large Stokes shift and efficient luminescence collection of TADF effectively ensure the light outcoupling efficiency. Further, flexible X&#8208;ray scintillator screens with an area of 400 cm2 are prepared using poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) as the carrier, exhibiting&#160;excellent scintillation properties with light yields as high as 49&#160;400 photons MeV&#8722;1, spatial resolutions up to 18 lp mm&#8722;1 and detection limits as low as 65 nGy s&#8722;1. Finally, the high&#8208;quality imaging results of non&#8208;planar and dynamic objects by such screens are demonstrated. It is believed that the explored Cs2ZrCl6@PDMS flexible scintillator screens would offer a big step toward expanding the application range of scintillators in different environments.

         <dc:description>
Ambipolar transport and nonvolatile programming of MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are exploited to enable a low&#8208;power, compact, and multibit digital modulator, which can be used in internet&#8208;of&#8208;things edge communication.








Abstract
Energy, area, and bandwidth efficient communication primitives are essential to sustain the rapid increase in connectivity among internet&#8208;of&#8208;things (IoT) edge devices. While IoT edge&#8208;sensing, edge&#8208;computing, and edge&#8208;storage have witnessed innovation in materials and devices, IoT edge communication is yet to experience such transformation. The aging silicon (Si)&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology continues to remain the mainstay of communication devices where they are used to implement amplitude, frequency, and phase shift keying (amplitude&#8208;shift keying [ASK]/frequency&#8208;shift keying [FSK]/phase&#8208;shift keying [PSK]). Keying allows digital information to be communicated over a radio channel. While CMOS&#8208;based keying devices have evolved over the years, their hardware footprint and energy consumption are major concerns for resource constrained IoT communication. Furthermore, separate circuit designs and hardware elements are needed for each keying scheme and achieving multibit modulation to improve bandwidth efficiency remains a challenge. Here, a reconfigurable modulator is introduced that exploits unique ambipolar transport and programmable Dirac voltage in ultrathin MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors to achieve ASK, FSK, and PSK modulation. Furthermore, by integrating two programmed MoTe2 field&#8208;effect transistors, multibit data modulation is demonstrated, which improves the bandwidth efficiency by 200%. Finally, a frequency quadrupler is also realized exploiting the unique &#8220;double&#8208;well&#8221; transfer characteristic.

         <title>Transformable ECM Deprivation System Effectively Suppresses Renal Cell Carcinoma by Reversing Anoikis Resistance and Increasing Chemotherapy Sensitivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transformable extracellular matrix (ECM) deprivation system (EDS) deprives the ECM of tumors and restraints cancer progression by targeting fibronectin (FN). The cage&#8208;like nanofibers deprive the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, which block the FN&#8208;mediated tumor&#8208;promoting signaling and ultimately reverse anoikis resistance and ameliorate cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR).








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR). Fibronectin (FN) is a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM&#8208;mediated anoikis resistance and CAM&#8208;DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, an ECM deprivation system (EDS) is developed based on FN targeting self&#8208;assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to: i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long&#8208;term retention in ECM, ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and iii) serving as a drug&#8208;loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM&#8208;DR. The results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of the FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy&#8208;sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with doxorubicin (DOX). In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor&#8208;promoting effect of ECM and may provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo&#8208;drug sensitivity.

&lt;p&gt;Transformable extracellular matrix (ECM) deprivation system (EDS) deprives the ECM of tumors and restraints cancer progression by targeting fibronectin (FN). The cage-like nanofibers deprive the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC) cells, which block the FN-mediated tumor-promoting signaling and ultimately reverse anoikis resistance and ameliorate cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Extracellular matrix (ECM) is crucial in various biological functions during tumor progression, including induction of anoikis resistance and cell adhesion-mediated drug resistance (CAM-DR). Fibronectin (FN) is a vital ECM component with direct regulatory effects on ECM-mediated anoikis resistance and CAM-DR, making it an attractive and innovative therapeutic target for depriving ECM in tumor tissue. Herein, an ECM deprivation system (EDS) is developed based on FN targeting self-assembly peptide for constructing nanofibers in the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC), which contributes to: i) targeting and recognizing FN to form nanofibers for long-term retention in ECM, ii) reversing anoikis resistance via arresting the FN signaling pathway, and iii) serving as a drug-loading platform for sensitizing chemotherapy by ameliorating CAM-DR. The results reveal that EDS significantly reverses anoikis resistance of RCC cells by inhibiting the phosphorylation of FAK, a positive regulator of the FN signaling pathway. Meanwhile, EDS serves as a chemotherapy-sensitizer of cancer, exerting significant synergistic effects with doxorubicin (DOX). In vivo validation experiments show that EDS effectively suppresses metastasis and tumor growth with chemotherapy resistance. Collectively, the innovative EDS notably inhibits the tumor-promoting effect of ECM and may provide a novel approach for suppressing ECM and enhancing chemo-drug sensitivity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Roughness Suppression in Electrochemical Nanoimprinting of Si for Applications in Silicon Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>

Novel chip&#8208;scale near&#8208;infrared optics requires scalable fabrication of 3D&#160;freeform nano&#8208; and microstructures in silicon. This manuscript investigates the origin of silicon roughening during metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting and minimizes it to levels comparable with plasma etching. Functional imprinted rib waveguides on silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers are demonstrated, paving the way for its broad use to micromachine 3D photonic devices at scale.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;assisted electrochemical nanoimprinting (Mac&#8208;Imprint) scales the fabrication of micro&#8208; and nanoscale 3D freeform geometries in silicon and holds the promise to enable novel chip&#8208;scale optics operating at the near&#8208;infrared spectrum. However, Mac&#8208;Imprint of silicon concomitantly generates mesoscale roughness (e.g., protrusion size&#160;&#8776;45&#160;nm) creating prohibitive levels of light scattering. This arises from the requirement to coat stamps with nanoporous gold catalyst that, while sustaining etchant diffusion, imprints its pores (e.g., average diameter&#160;&#8776;42&#160;nm) onto silicon. In this work, roughness is reduced to sub&#8208;10&#160;nm levels, which is in par with plasma etching, by decreasing pore size of the catalyst via dealloying in far&#8208;from equilibrium conditions. At this level, single&#8208;digit nanometric details such as grain&#8208;boundary grooves of the catalyst are imprinted and attributed to the resolution limit of Mac&#8208;Imprint, which is argued to be twice the Debye length (i.e., 1.7&#160;nm)&#8212;a finding that broadly applies to metal&#8208;assisted chemical etching. Last, Mac&#8208;Imprint is employed to produce single&#8208;mode rib&#8208;waveguides on pre&#8208;patterned silicon&#8208;on&#8208;insulator wafers with root&#8208;mean&#8208;square line&#8208;edge roughness less than 10&#160;nm while providing depth uniformity (i.e., 42.9&#160;&#177;&#160;5.5&#160;nm), and limited levels of silicon defect formation (e.g., Raman peak shift&#160;&lt;&#160;0.1&#160;cm&#8722;1) and sidewall scattering.

         <title>Triclinic Metamaterials by Tristable Origami with Reprogrammable Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring full anisotropy (triclinic symmetry) of material microstructures can lead to surprising discoveries. A class of origami&#8208;inspired triclinic metamaterials is proposed, which couples shear and normal strains, and leads to reversible auxeticity, in the changing triclinic frame. In the tessellation, linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration, which can be reprogrammed into distinct frustrated material states.








Abstract
Geometrical&#8208;frustration&#8208;induced anisotropy and inhomogeneity are explored to achieve unique properties of metamaterials that set them apart from conventional materials. According to Neumann's principle, to achieve anisotropic responses, the material unit cell should possess less symmetry. Based on such guidelines, a triclinic metamaterial system of minimal symmetry is presented, which originates from a Trimorph origami pattern with a simple and insightful geometry: a basic unit cell with four tilted panels and four corresponding creases. The intrinsic geometry of the Trimorph origami, with its changing tilting angles, dictates a folding motion that varies the primitive vectors of the unit cell, couples the shear and normal strains of its extrinsic bulk, and leads to an unusual Poisson effect. Such an effect, associated with reversible auxeticity in the changing triclinic frame, is observed experimentally, and predicted theoretically by elegant mathematical formulae. The nonlinearities of the folding motions allow the unit cell to display three robust stable states, connected through snapping instabilities. When the tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resemble linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration. The frustration is reprogrammable into distinct stable and inhomogeneous states by arbitrarily selecting the location of a single or multiple point defects. The Trimorph origami demonstrates the possibility of creating origami metamaterials with symmetries that are hitherto nonexistent, leading to triclinic metamaterials with tunable anisotropy for potential applications such as wave propagation control and compliant&#160;microrobots.

         <title>A Unique NiOOH@FeOOH Heteroarchitecture for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution in Saline Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism is proposed to address the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role on the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient non&#8208;precious metal electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in low&#8208;grade or saline water is currently of great importance for the large&#8208;scale production of hydrogen. In this study, by using an electrochemical activation pretreatment, metal oxy(hydroxide) nanosheet structures derived from self&#8208;supported nickel&#8211;iron phosphide and nitride nanoarrays grown on Ni foam are successfully fabricated for OER catalysis in saline water. It is demonstrated that the different NiOOH and NiOOH@FeOOH (NiOOH grown on FeOOH) structures are generated from nickel&#8211;iron nitride and phosphide, respectively, after electrochemical activation. In particular, the NiOOH@FeOOH heteroarchitecture shows outstanding electrocatalytic performance with an ultralow overpotential of 292&#160;mV to drive the current density of 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. An unconventional dual&#8208;sites mechanism (UDSM) is proposed to address the OER process on NiOOH@FeOOH and show that the FeOOH underlayer plays a critical role regarding the enhanced OER activity of NiOOH. The new possible UDSM involving two reaction sites presents a different understanding of the OER process on multi&#8208;OH layer complexes, which is expected to guide the design of heteroarchitecture electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Intermetallic PtRhBiSnSb Nanoplates for Highly Efficient Alcohol Oxidation Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt/Rh/Bi/Sn/Sb atoms are successfully constructed via a one&#8208;pot method. Benefiting from the synergism of the chosen five elements, these well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb intermetallic nanoplates achieve ultrahigh performance toward the electrochemical oxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, emerging as a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for the alcohol oxidation reactions.








Abstract
The control of multimetallic ensembles at the atomic&#8208;level is challenging, especially for high&#8208;entropy alloys (HEAs) possessing five or more elements. Herein, the one&#8208;pot synthesis of hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) PtRhBiSnSb high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoplates with intrinsically isolated Pt, Rh, Bi, Sn, and Sb atoms is reported, to boost the electrochemical oxidation of liquid fuels. Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well&#8208;defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&#8722;1Pt+Rh toward the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves record&#8208;high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in an&#160;alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron&#8208;transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, robust electronic structures of the active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work offers significant research advances in developing well&#8208;defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.

Taking advantage of these combined five metals, the well-defined PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates exhibit a remarkable mass activity of 19.529, 15.558, and 7.535 A mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;Pt+Rh&lt;/sub&gt; toward the electrooxidation of methanol, ethanol, and glycerol in alkaline electrolytes, respectively, representing a state-of-the-art multifunctional electrocatalyst for alcohol oxidation reactions. In particular, the PtRhBiSnSb HEI achieves record-high methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) activity in an&#160;alkaline environment. Theoretical calculations demonstrate that the introduction of the fifth metal Rh enhances the electron-transfer efficiency in PtRhBiSnSb HEI nanoplates, which contributes to the improved oxidation capability. Meanwhile, robust electronic structures of the active sites are achieved due to the synergistic protections from Bi, Sn, and Sb sites. This work offers significant research advances in developing well-defined HEA with delicate control over compositions and properties.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Puffball&#8208;Inspired Microrobotic Systems with Robust Payload, Strong Protection, and Targeted Locomotion for On&#8208;Demand Drug Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by features of natural puffball fungi, including a fruitbody to store trillions of spores and a barrier cap to provide payload protection and stimuli&#8208;triggered release, a bioinspired microrobotic system with an internal chamber and near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive sealing layer is presented for drug delivery. The microrobots show robust payload capacity, strong payload protection, on&#8208;demand release, and targeted locomotion.








Abstract
Microrobots are recognized as transformative solutions for drug delivery systems (DDSs) because they can navigate through the body to specific locations and enable targeted drug release. However, their realization is substantially limited by insufficient payload capacity, unavoidable drug leakage/deactivation, and strict modification/stability criteria for drugs. Natural puffballs possess fascinating features that are highly desirable for DDSs, including a large fruitbody for storing spores, a flexible protective cap, and environmentally triggered release mechanisms. This report presents a puffball&#8208;inspired microrobotic system which incorporates an internal chamber for loading large drug quantities and spatial drug separation, and a near&#8208;infrared&#8208;responsive top&#8208;sealing layer offering strong drug protection and on&#8208;demand release. These puffball&#8208;inspired microrobots (PIMs) display tunable loading capacities up to high concentrations and enhanced drug protection with minimal drug leakage. Upon near&#8208;infrared laser irradiation, on&#8208;demand drug delivery with rapid release efficiency is achieved. The PIMs also demonstrate translational motion velocities, switchable motion modes, and precise locomotion under a rotating magnetic field. This work provides strong proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept for a DDS that combines the superior locomotion capability of microrobots with the unique characteristics of puffballs, thereby illustrating a versatile avenue for development of a new generation of microrobots for targeted drug delivery.

         <title>Sprayable Hydrogel for Instant Sealing of Vascular Anastomosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bleeding related complications following vascular surgery represent a real challenge for patients and their clinicians. Commercially available materials force clinicians to choose between adequate performance or adequate biocompatibility. An adhesive hydrogel approach, combining oxidized dextran, oxidized alginate, and polyamidoamine (PAMAM) allows sealing at the tissue:graft interface while maintaining biocompatibility. The biocompatibility and functionality of this family of materials is been tested in small and large animal models.








Abstract
Bleeding&#8208;related complications following vascular surgeries occur in up to half of the patients&#8212;500&#8201;000 cases annually in the United States alone. This results in additional procedures, increased mortality rate, and prolonged hospitalization, posing a burden on the healthcare system. Commercially available materials rely, in large, on forming covalent bonds between the tissue and the biomaterial to achieve adhesion. Here, it is shown that a biomaterial based on oxidized alginate and oxidized dextran together with polyamidoamine (PAMAM) dendrimer amine provides simultaneous electrostatic and covalent interactions between the biomaterial and the tissue, maximizing adhesion. This study finds that the material withstands supraphysiological pressures (&#8776;300&#160;mmHg) and prevents bleeding in a rabbit aortic puncture model and in a pig carotid bilateral poly(tetrafluoroethylene) graft model&#8212;achieving superior performance to commercially available materials such as Tisseel and BioGlue. Material biocompatibility is validated in comprehensive in vitro and in vivo studies in accordance with the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines, including in vitro neutral red uptake test, subcutaneous implantation in rabbits, ames genotoxicity, and guinea pig maximization test. This material has the potential to provide with adequate seal and reduced complications following complex vascular surgeries, including hard&#8208;to&#8208;seal tissue&#8211;graft interfaces.

         <title>A Calcium Fluoride Nanozyme for Ultrasound&#8208;Amplified and Ca2+&#8208;Overload&#8208;Enhanced Catalytic Tumor Nanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct valence&#8208;invariable CaF2 nanozyme with ultrasound&#8208;enhanced peroxidase&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment.








Abstract
The anticancer mechanism of nanozymes is dominantly associated with the capacity for generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) caused by the valence change of metal elements. However, very little research is focused on and has achieved the exploration and development of enzyme&#8208;mimicking activities of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds. Herein, a distinct valence&#8208;invariable calcium fluoride (CaF2) nanozyme with ultrasound (US)&#8208;enhanced peroxidase (POD)&#8208;mimicking activity is rationally designed and engineered for efficient calcium (Ca2+)&#8208;overload&#8208;enhanced catalytic tumor nanotherapy, which is the first paradigm of Ca&#8208;based nanozymes for catalytic cancer treatment. The release of exogenous Ca2+ ions from CaF2 nanocrystals and deleterious ROS generation derived from US&#8208;amplified POD&#8208;mimicking properties facilitate intracellular Ca2+ accumulation and achieve Ca2+&#8208;overload&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction through introducing exogenous Ca2+ ions and regulating calcium&#8208;pumping channels of neoplastic cells. Especially, US as an exogenous energy input is capable of substantially amplifying POD&#8208;mimicking catalytic activities of CaF2 nanozyme, ultimately achieving efficient anti&#8208;neoplastic outcome on both 4T1 breast tumor and H22 hepatic carcinoma animal models. Such a discovery of enzyme&#8208;like activity of valence&#8208;invariable metal compounds can broaden the cognition scope of nanozymes and effectively serves the field of catalytic and chemoreactive nanomedicine.

         <title>Lattice&#8208;Mismatch&#8208;Driven Small&#8208;Angle Moir&#233; Twists in Epitaxially Grown 2D Vertical Layered Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epitaxially grown vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) of mixed 2D layered materials are often thought to align without angular misorientation. However, it is shown that high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural lattice mismatch value. This opens a pathway for scalable Moire VLH systems.








Abstract
Artificially introduced small twist angles at the interfaces of vertical layered heterostructures (VLHs) have allowed deterministic tuning of electronic and optical properties such as strongly correlated electronic phases and Moir&#233; excitons. But creating a Moir&#233; twist in van der Waals (vdWs) systems by manual stacking is challenging in reproducibility, uniformity, and accuracy of the twist angle, which hinders future studies. Here, it is demonstrated that contrary to the commonly believed 0&#176;&#8208;orientation in vdWs epitaxy, these VLHs show small twist angles controlled by the low&#8208;order commensurate phase with low energy and local atomic relaxation. A commensurate multilevel map is proposed to predict possible orientations. Remarkably, high&#8208;mismatch VLHs show discrete and sometimes non&#8208;zero twist angles dependent on their natural mismatch value. Such framework is experimentally confirmed in five epitaxially grown VLHs under high&#8208;angle annular dark field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM), and can provide significant insights for large&#8208;scale engineering of twist angle in VLHs.

         <title>An Enzyme&#8208;Engineered Nonporous Copper(I) Coordination Polymer Nanoplatform for Cuproptosis&#8208;Based Synergistic Cancer Therapy</title>

An enzyme&#8208;engineered cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in cancer cells is reported, which may invigorate studies pursuing rational design of effective cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.








Abstract
Cuproptosis, a newly identified form of regulated cell death that is copper&#8208;dependent, offers great opportunities for exploring the use of copper&#8208;based nanomaterials inducing cuproptosis for cancer treatment. Here, a glucose oxidase (GOx)&#8208;engineered nonporous copper(I) 1,2,4&#8208;triazolate ([Cu(tz)]) coordination polymer (CP) nanoplatform, denoted as GOx@[Cu(tz)], for starvation&#8208;augmented cuproptosis and photodynamic synergistic therapy is developed. Importantly, the catalytic activity of GOx is shielded in the nonporous scaffold but can be &#8220;turned on&#8221; for efficient glucose depletion only upon glutathione (GSH) stimulation in cancer cells, thereby proceeding cancer starvation therapy. The depletion of glucose and GSH sensitizes cancer cells to the GOx@[Cu(tz)]&#8208;mediated cuproptosis, producing aggregation of lipoylated mitochondrial proteins, the target of copper&#8208;induced toxicity. The increased intracellular hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels, due to the oxidation of glucose, activates the type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy of GOx@[Cu(tz)]. The in vivo experimental results indicate that GOx@[Cu(tz)] produces negligible systemic toxicity and inhibits tumor growth by 92.4% in athymic mice bearing 5637 bladder tumors. This is thought to be the first report of a cupreous nanomaterial capable of inducing cuproptosis and cuproptosis&#8208;based synergistic therapy in bladder cancer, which should invigorate studies pursuing rational design of efficacious cancer therapy strategies based on cuproptosis.

         <title>A Medium&#8208;Bandgap Nonfullerene Acceptor Enabling Organic Photovoltaic Cells with 30% Efficiency under Indoor Artificial Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new acceptor of FTCC&#63743;Br and frequently&#8208;used ITCC is studied, due to their similar optical and electrochemistry properties. Under a light intensity of 1000 lux, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device with a small electrostatic potential (ESP) offset gives a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.4%, while the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device with a large ESP offset achieves a record PCE of 30.2%.








Abstract
The correlation between molecular structure and photovoltaic performance is lagging for constructing high&#8208;performance indoor organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells. Herein, this relationship is investigated in depth by employing two medium&#8208;bandgap nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs). The newly synthesized NFA of FTCC&#63743;Br exhibits a similar bandgap and molecular energy level, but a much stronger dipole moment and larger average electrostatic potential (ESP) compared with ITCC. After blending with the polymer donor PB2, the PB2:ITCC and PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blends exhibit favorable bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphologies and the same driving force, but the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br blend exhibits a large ESP difference. In OPV cells, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based device produces a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 11.0%, whereas the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based device gives an excellent PCE of 14.8% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.05&#160;V, which is the highest value among OPV cells with VOC values above 1.0&#160;V. When both acceptor&#8208;based devices work under a 1000 lux of 3000 K light&#8208;emitting diode, the PB2:ITCC&#8208;based 1 cm2 device yields a good PCE of 25.4%; in contrast, the PB2:FTCC&#63743;Br&#8208;based 1 cm2 device outputs a record PCE of 30.2%. These results suggest that a large ESP offset in photovoltaic materials is important for achieving high&#8208;performance OPV cells.

         <title>Mechanically Induced Nanoscale Architecture Endows a Titanium Carbide MXene Electrode with Integrated High Areal and Volumetric Capacitance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are synthesized in highly viscous reaction media and form binder&#8208;free densely packed electrodes under mechanical compression of 300&#160;MPa. Buckling of the MXene stacks and intrinsic intercalation structure translate to the hierarchical architecture at the nanoscale which brings excellent performance in both areal and volumetric capacitances.








Abstract
Complete utilization of electrochemically active materials while maintaining the high areal/volumetric packing density is a goal to be achieved in miniaturized supercapacitor devices, which therefore display both high volumetric and areal energy density. Although critical, it is usually challenging to achieve this goal by optimizing the electrode architecture. Dense packing of active materials maximizes the volumetric capacitance but&#160;also results in sluggish diffusion of the electrolyte. Structurization of the electrode by forming large pores creates a pathway for electrolyte penetration but reduces the volumetric energy density. Here, densified electrodes with hierarchical porous architecture at the nanoscale are reported, which provide an alternative solution. Worm&#8208;like expanded titanium carbide MXene powders are produced in highly viscous reaction media and assembled by mechanical compression. The expanded morphology of the MXene powders translates into a buckling microstructure in the electrodes, resulting in 28.2 &#177; 4.1% porosity mainly in the form of nanosized pores. At the sub&#8208;nanometer scale, the diffusion of electrolytes is enhanced in interlayer space of the bended lattice with pillared intercalants. These hierarchical structural features lead to both high areal and volumetric capacitance (11.4&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;2 coupled with 770&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) in hundred&#8208;micrometers&#8208;thick electrodes, which inspires the design of high&#8208;performance electrochemical energy storage devices.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Production of Rectorite Nanosheets and Their Co&#8208;Assembly with Aramid Nanofibers for High&#8208;Performance Electrical Insulating Nanopapers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gram&#8208;scale rectorite nanosheets (RNs) with ultrathin thickness (&#8776;5 nm) are efficiently prepared from raw rectorite microplatelets via a scalable exfoliation approach and rapidly separated from their suspension by an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic nanopapers, achieving considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature resistant properties.








Abstract
Compared with raw rectorite microplatelets (RMs), rectorite nanosheets (RNs) have considerably greater application prospects in the preparation of advanced composite materials because of their larger aspect ratio, higher surface reactivity, and intrinsically superior mechanical and physical properties. However, the difficulty in the efficient preparation of RNs significantly limits their large&#8208;scale applications. Here, a scalable poly(vinylpyrrolidone)&#8208;assisted stirring approach is developed to prepare ultrathin RNs from the abundant natural RMs. A higher production rate (&#8776;0.675&#160;g h&#8722;1) is achieved compared with that of most other nanosheets. Additionally, instead of using conventional time&#8208; and energy&#8208;consuming high&#8208;speed centrifugation, an efficient poly(dienedimethylammonium chloride)&#8208;assisted sedimentation strategy is proposed here to rapidly separate the exfoliated RNs from the RN dispersion. Then, the RNs are co&#8208;assembled with aramid nanofibers (ANFs) into large&#8208;scale nacre&#8208;mimetic ANF&#8208;RN nanopapers with considerably enhanced mechanical, electrical insulating, and high&#8208;temperature&#8208;resistant&#160;properties compared with pure ANF nanopapers and ANF&#8208;RM micropapers. Moreover, these properties are superior to those of previously reported ANF&#8208;based nanopapers and commercial insulating micropapers.

Laser processing of graphene oxide on a plastic substrate covered by glass makes chemical transformations, mass transfer, and integration into the glass. This new and scalable technology can revolutionize glass electronics by making devices more robust, free&#8208;form, and cheaper than ever before.








Abstract
Glass electronics inspire the emergence of smart functional surfaces. To evolve this concept to the next level, developing new strategies for scalable, inexpensive, and electrically conductive glass&#8208;based robust nanocomposites is crucial. Graphene is an attractive material as a conductive filler; however, integrating it firmly into a glass with no energy&#8208;intensive sintering, melting, or harsh chemicals has not been possible until now. Moreover, these methods have very limited capability for fabricating robust patterns for electronic circuits. In this work, a conductive (160&#160;O&#937; sq&#8722;1) and resilient nanocomposite between glass and graphene is achieved via single&#8208;step laser&#8208;induced backward transfer (LIBT). Beyond conventional LIBT involving mass transfer, this approach simultaneously drives chemical transformations in glass including silicon compound formation and graphene oxide (GO) reduction. These processes take place together with the generation and transfer of the highest&#8208;quality laser&#8208;reduced GO (rGO) reported to date (Raman intensity ratio ID/IG&#160;= 0.31) and its integration into the glass. The rGO&#8208;LIBT nanocomposite is further functionalized with silver to achieve a highly sensitive (10&#8722;9&#160;m) dual&#8208;channel plasmonic optical and electrochemical sensor. Besides the electrical circuit demonstration,&#160;an electrothermal heater is fabricated that reaches&#160;temperatures above 300&#160;&#176;C and continuously operates&#160;for over 48&#160;h.

         <title>Super&#8208;Reversible CuF2 Cathodes Enabled by Cu2+&#8208;Coordinated Alginate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu&#8208;ion dissolution in copper fluoride (CuF2) cathodes is successfully suppressed by in&#160;situ formation of a Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate&#160;layer on the surface of CuF2&#160;nanoparticles during the electrode&#8208;fabrication, which can selectively enable the transportation of Li ions while blocking the mobility of Cu ions, reduce the undesirable interaction between electrolyte/electrode interface, and thus improving the cyclic stability of CuF2.








Abstract
Copper fluoride (CuF2) has the highest energy density among all metal fluoride cathodes owing to its high theoretical potential (3.55&#160;V) and high capacity (528&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1). However, CuF2&#160;can only survive for less than five cycles, mainly due to serious Cu&#8208;ion dissolution during charge/discharge cycles. Herein, copper dissolution is successfully suppressed by forming Cu2+&#8208;coordinated sodium alginate (Cu&#8208;SA) on the surface of CuF2&#160;particles during the electrode fabrication process, by using water as a slurry solvent and sodium alginate (SA) as a binder. The trace dissolved Cu2+ in water from CuF2&#160;can in situ cross&#8208;link with SA binder forming a conformal Cu&#8208;SA layer on CuF2&#160;surface. After water evaporation during the electrode dry process, the Cu&#8208;SA layer is Li&#8208;ion conductor but Cu2+ insulator, which can effectively suppress the dissolution of Cu&#8208;ions in the organic 4&#160;m LiClO4/ethylene carbonate/propylene carbonate electrolyte, enhancing the reversibility of CuF2. CuF2&#160;electrode with SA binder delivers a reversible capacity of 420.4&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8208;1&#160;after 50&#160;cycles at 0.05&#160;C, reaching an energy density of 1009.1&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8208;1. Cu2+ cross&#8208;link polymer coating on CuF2&#160;opens the door for stabilizing the high&#8208;energy and low&#8208;cost CuF2&#160;cathode for next&#8208;generation Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Nondestructive Photopatterning of Heavy&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dots is presented by using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers containing multiple azide units. The branched crosslinkers effectively interlock quantum dot films without compromising the intrinsic photoluminescence and electroluminescence properties of quantum dots. This nondestructive method can be directly adapted to photolithography facilities widely available in industry.








Abstract
Electroluminescence from quantum dots (QDs) is a suitable photon source for futuristic displays offering hyper&#8208;realistic images with free&#8208;form factors. Accordingly, a nondestructive and scalable process capable of rendering multicolored QD patterns on a scale of several micrometers needs to be established. Here, nondestructive direct photopatterning for heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs is reported using branched light&#8208;driven ligand crosslinkers (LiXers) containing multiple azide units. The branched LiXers effectively interlock QD films via photo&#8208;crosslinking native aliphatic QD surface ligands without compromising the intrinsic optoelectronic properties of QDs. Using branched LiXers with six sterically engineered azide units, RGB QD patterns are achieved on the micrometer scale. The photo&#8208;crosslinking process does not affect the photoluminescence and electroluminescence characteristics of QDs and extends the device lifetime. This nondestructive method can be readily adapted to industrial processes and make an immediate impact on display technologies, as it uses widely available photolithography facilities and high&#8208;quality heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free QDs with aliphatic ligands.

         <title>A Molecular&#8208;Sieve Electrolyte Membrane enables Separator&#8208;Free Zinc Batteries with Ultralong Cycle Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecular&#8208;sieves&#8208;based electrolyte membranes are designed to regulate the activity of water, and inhibit dendrite growth and hydrogen evolution on the Zn anode, which greatly prolongs the cycle life of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The poor stability of the zinc&#8208;metal anode is a main bottleneck for practical application of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a series of molecular sieves with various channel sizes are investigated as an electrolyte host to regulate the ionic environment of Zn2+ on the surface of the zinc anode and to realize separator&#8208;free batteries. Based on the ZSM&#8208;5 molecular sieve, a solid&#8211;liquid mixed electrolyte membrane is constructed to uniformize the transport of zinc ions and foster dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition. Side reactions can also be suppressed through tailoring the solvation sheath and restraining the activity of water molecules in electrolyte. A V2O5||ZSM&#8208;5||Zn full cell shows significantly enhanced performance compared to cells using glass fiber separator. Specifically, it exhibits a high specific capacity of 300 mAh g&#8722;1, and a capacity retention of 98.67% after 1000 cycles and 82.67% after 3000 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. It is attested that zeolites (ZSM&#8208;5, H&#8208;&#946;, and Bate) with channel sizes of 5&#8211;7 &#197; result in best cycle stability. Given the low cost and recyclability of the ZSM and its potent function, this work may further lower the cost and boost the industrial application of AZIBs.

Phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are successfully introduced into perovskite film to passivate the intrinsic defects and accelerate the energy&#8208;transfer process. Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus is also constructed to enhance carrier injection and charge&#8208;transport ability. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and a maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842 cd m&#8722;2 are successfully achieved.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D perovskites have emerged as a promising luminescent material for perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (Pe&#8208;LEDs). However, efficiency and stability are still obstacles to practical application due to numerous defects and inefficient energy transfer of perovskite films. Herein, functional phenethylammonium bromine&#8208;modified CsPbBr3 nanocrystals (PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs) are first introduced as multifunctional additive to simultaneously improve abovementioned problems. PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 NCs not only serve as heteronuclear seeds and trigger growth, thus greatly reducing leakage current, but also deliver Cs+ and Br&#8722; to passivate the intrinsic defects inside film. More importantly, the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3 construct a new carrier&#8208;transfer pathway from the small&#8208;n phase of the quasi&#8208;2D perovskite to the PEA&#8208;CsPbBr3, which not only accelerates the energy&#8208;transfer process but also promotes radiation recombination of carriers due to stronger quantum confinement effect. Afterward, the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate/poly[9,9&#8208;dioctylfluoreneco&#8208;N&#8208;[4&#8208;(3&#8208;methylpropyl)]diphenylamine]:black phosphorus quantum dot double hole&#8208;transport layer is successfully constructed to enhance its carrier&#8208;injection and charge&#8208;transport abilities. Consequently, a champion external quantum efficiency of 25.32% and maximal brightness of 128&#8239;842&#160;cd m&#8722;2 are achieved, which is the record efficiency of the quasi&#8208;2D Pe&#8208;LED with pure green emission at 530&#160;nm. Moreover, an impressive 174&#160;min lifetime is obtained at T50, which is about five times longer than the control device.

Photopatterning
In article number 2205504, BongSoo Kim, Wan Ki Bae, Moon Sung Kang, and co&#8208;workers show how light&#8208;emissive quantum dots can be directly photopatterned using additives containing multiple azide units that undergo a UV&#8208;induced crosslinking reaction with the surface ligands of quantum dots. Patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dot patterns can be successfully formed at micrometer&#8208;scale resolution using photolithography facilities widely available in industry.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202205153"&gt;2205153&lt;/a&gt;, Bao-Lian Su, Jian Liu, and co-workers report a nanoscale chemical surgery strategy on phenolic resins to construct multilevel hollow nanostructures. These special architectures contribute to the fabrication of a smart nanoreactor with precise metal nanoparticles spatial location (Au nanoparticles internally encapsulated and Pd nanoparticles externally supported), which exhibits exceptional catalytic hydrogenation performance.

Origami Metamaterials
In article number 2107998, Glaucio H. Paulino and co&#8208;workers create a class of metamaterials derived from a reconfigurable origami pattern with triclinic symmetry, leading to reversible auxeticity. When the tristable unit cells are tessellated, phenomena that resemble linear and point defects emerge as a result of geometric frustration, which can be reprogrammed at desired locations. The resulting tessellations and metamaterials display tunable anisotropy and have potential applications to wave propagation control and in microrobots.

Renal Cell Carcinoma
In article number 2203518, Ziqi Wang, Lei Wang, Hao Wang, Wanhai Xu, and co&#8208;workers report a transformable extracellular matrix (ECM) deprivation system (EDS) that targets fibronectin for depriving the ECM of renal cell carcinoma (RCC). The cage&#8208;like nanofibers formed by the EDS deprive the ECM of RCC cells, which efficaciously reverses anoikis resistance and ameliorates the RCC's cell&#8208;adhesion&#8208;mediated drug resistance (CAM&#8208;DR).

         <title>Stability of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes: Existing Issues and Mitigation Strategies Related to Both Material and Device Aspects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 43, October 26, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are sensitive to light, humidity, heat, and electric field, and their limited stability constitutes severe bottleneck for display applications. Strategies including structure design, composition adjustment, shell protection, dimensionality control, heat dissipation, and defect passivation, which can be applied to improve the PeLED stability, are reviewed, and future opportunities and challenges are considered.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties, such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency, with the benefits of low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;area, solution&#8208;based processing. Composition&#8208; and dimension&#8208;tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieving operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs are considered. Then, strategies for improving the stability of perovskite materials are reviewed, such as compositional engineering, dimensionality control, defect passivation, suitable encapsulation matrices, and fabrication of core/shell perovskite nanocrystals. For improvement of the operational stability of perovskite LEDs, the use of inorganic charge&#8208;transport layers, optimization of charge balance, and proper thermal management are considered. The review is concluded with a detailed account of the current challenges and a perspective on the key approaches and opportunities on how to reach the goal of stable, bright, and efficient perovskite LEDs.

&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites combine excellent electronic and optical properties, such as defect tolerance and high photoluminescence efficiency, with the benefits of low-cost, large-area, solution-based processing. Composition- and dimension-tunable properties of perovskites have already been utilized in bright and efficient light-emitting diodes (LEDs). At the same time, there are still great challenges ahead to achieving operational and spectral stability of these devices. In this review, the origins of instability of perovskite materials, and reasons for their degradation in LEDs are considered.

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost-effective, high-energy-density energy-storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large-scale practical implementation of Na-metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low-cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well-ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion-redistributors to self-orientate/homogenize the flux of Na-ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long-term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive-free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low-cost, and safe-credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali-metal batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of using preexisting polymer chains to fabricate hydrogels from doughs is reported. The dough is formed by mixing the polymers with water and photoinitiator. Kneading and annealing then homogenize the dough and entangle the polymers. The polymers are crosslinked and swollen in water to equilibrium. Such a hydrogel resolves the conflict between swell&#8208;resistance and toughness, while having near&#8208;perfect elasticity.








Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with two widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Information&#8208;Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Self&#8208;sustained programmable hygro&#8208;electronic interfaces for humidity&#8208;regulated hierarchical information encryption and display</title>

Abstract
The emerging moisture&#8208;driven energy generation (MEG) technology opens up new possibilities for humidity&#8208;responsive materials, devices and interdisciplinary opportunities in fields like information security. However, such potential remains untapped. Here, we report an original MEG structure with a hygro&#8208;ionic energy&#8208;conversion route by selective coating of ionic hygroscopic hydrogels on a carbon black surface. The hygro&#8208;ionic route features a process in which the scavenged energy is stored in the electrical double layers formed at the interfaces between the ionic hydrogel and the carbon nanoparticles. The resultant electrical field developed across the hydrogel&#8208;coated wet carbon and the rest dry carbon area is thus durably lasted. Based on this unique structure, we put forward the hygro&#8208;electronic information interfaces (HEII) for humidity&#8208;regulated information encryption and display by devising the hydrogel patterns on the carbon platform. Further by tuning the hygroscopicity of ionic hydrogels and incorporating encoding methods (e.g., Morse code), we demonstrate that the HEII platform is programmable to carry different information in certain humidity ranges. Unlike those conventional anticounterfeiting methods that optically reveal the hidden information once the required stimulus is provided, the new HEII serves as a hierarchical solution for high&#8208;security encryption and display.

         <title>Impact&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels by Harnessing 2D Hierarchical Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
With the strengthening capacity through harnessing multi&#8208;length&#8208;scale structural hierarchy, synthetic hydrogels hold tremendous promise as a low&#8208;cost and abundant material for applications demanding unprecedented mechanical robustness. However, integrating high impact resistance and high water content yet superior softness in a single hydrogel material still remains a grand challenge. Here, we&#160;report a simple yet effective strategy involving bidirectional freeze&#8208;casting and compression annealing, leading to a hierarchically&#8208;structured hydrogel material. Rational engineering of the distinct 2D lamellar structures, well&#8208;defined nanocrystalline domains and robust interfacial interaction among the lamellae, synergistically contributes to a record&#8208;high ballistic energy absorption capability (i.e. 2.1 kJ m&#8722;1), without sacrificing their high water content (i.e. 85 wt.%) and superior softness. Together with its low&#8208;cost and extraordinary energy dissipation capacity, our&#160;hydrogel materials present a durable alternative to conventional hydrogel materials for armour&#8208;like protection&#160;circumstances.

         <title>Recent Advances in Ultrathin Chiral Metasurfaces by Twisted Stacking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Artificial chiral nanostructures have been subject to extensive research for their unique chiroptical activities. Planarized chiral films of ultrathin thicknesses are in particular demand for easy on&#8208;chip integration and improved energy efficiency as polarization&#8208;sensitive metadevices. Recently, controlled twisted stacking of two or more layers of nanomaterials, such as two&#8208;dimensional van der Waals materials, ultrathin films or traditional metasurfaces, at an angle has emerged as a general strategy to introduce optical chirality into achiral solid&#8208;state systems. This method endows new degrees of freedom, e.g., the interlayer twist angle, to flexibly engineer and tune the chiroptical responses without having to change the material or the design, thus greatly facilitating the development of multifunctional metamaterials. In this review, recent exciting progresses on planar chiral metasurfaces are summarized and discussed from the viewpoints of building blocks, fabrication methods, as well as circular dichroism and modulation thereof in twisted stacked nanostructures. The review further highlights the ever&#8208;growing portfolio of applications of these chiral metasurfaces, including polarization conversion, information encryption, chiral sensing and as an engineering platform for hybrid metadevices. Finally, forward&#8208;looking prospects are provided.

Abstract
A wide variety of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials with excellent properties can meet almost all the requirements of functional materials for information sensing, processing, and feedback devices. Low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials are becoming the star of hope on the road to pursuing the human&#8208;machine&#8208;thing natural interaction, benefiting from the breakthroughs in precise preparation, performance regulation, structural design, and device construction in recent years. This review summarizes several types of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials commonly used in human&#8208;machine&#8208;thing natural interaction and outlines the differences in properties and application areas of different materials. According to the sequence of information flow in the human&#8208;machine&#8208;thing interaction process, we review the representative research progress of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials&#8208;based information sensing, processing, and feedback devices and discuss the key roles played by low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials. Finally, we look forward to the development trend and existing challenges of low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials in the field of human&#8208;machine&#8208;thing natural interaction technology.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Low Temperature Li/CFx Batteries Enabled by Fast&#8208;transport and Anion&#8208;pairing Liquefied Gas Electrolytes</title>

Abstract
Lithium fluorinated&#8208;carbon (Li/CFx) is one of the most promising chemistries for high&#8208;energy density primary energy storage system in applications where rechargeability is not required. Though Li/CFx demonstrates high energy density (&gt;2100&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1) under ambient conditions, achieving such a high energy density when exposed to subzero temperatures remains a challenge, particularly under high current density. Here, we report a liquefied gas electrolyte with an anion&#8208;pair solvation structure based on dimethyl ether with a low melting point (&#8722;141&#160;&#176;C) and low viscosity (0.12 mPa&#215;S, 20&#160;&#176;C), leading to high ionic conductivity (&gt; 3.5 mS cm&#8211;1) between &#8722;70 and 60&#160;&#176;C. Besides that, through systematic X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy integrated with transmission electron microscopy characterizations, we evaluate the interface of CFx for low&#8208;temperature performance. We conclude that the fast transport and anion&#8208;pairing solvation structure of the electrolyte brings about reduced charge transfer resistance at low temperatures, which resulted in significantly enhanced performance of Li/CFx cells (1690&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C;1172&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1, &#8722;70&#160;&#176;C based on active materials). Utilizing 50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 loading electrodes, the Li/CFx still displayed 1530&#160;Wh kg&#8211;1 at &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C. This work provides insights into the electrolyte design that may overcome the operational limits of batteries in extreme environments.

         <title>Unity of Opposites between Soluble and Insoluble Lithium Polysulfides in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;S battery performance is a compromise of opposites between the stability and capacity performance of the battery, in which the state of lithium polysulfides in electrolytes plays a pivotal role. The delicately dialectical relationship between soluble and insoluble lithium polysulfides in Li&#8211;S batteries is reviewed and discussed, and perspectives on the future research development of Li&#8211;S batteries are provided.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries based on Li&#8211;S chemistry show promise as being possible for next&#8208;generation energy storage devices because of their ultrahigh capacities and energy densities. Research over the past decade has demonstrated that the morphology of lithium polysulfides (LPSs) in electrolytes (soluble or insoluble) plays a decisive role in battery performance. Early studies have focused mainly on inhibiting the dissolution of LPSs and invested considerable effort to realize this objective. However, in recent years, a completely different view that the dissolution of LPSs during battery discharge/charge should be promoted has emerged. At this critical juncture in the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;S batteries, it is time to summarize and discuss both sides of the contradiction. Herein, an overview of these two opposite views pertaining to soluble and insoluble LPSs, including their historical environment, classical strategies, advantages, and disadvantages. Finally, the future morphology of LPSs in Li&#8211;S batteries is predicted based on a multiangle review of research studies conducted thus far, and the reasoning behind this conjecture is thoroughly discussed.

         <title>Scalable Ultrathin All&#8208;Organic Polymer Dielectric Films for High&#8208;Temperature Capacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cost&#8208;effective ultrasonic spray&#8208;coating is utilized for large&#8208;scale ultrathin dielectric films and large&#8208;size multilayer polymer foil film capacitors for high&#8208;temperature capacitive energy storage. All&#8208;organic ultrathin composite films of polyimides with &#63743;CF3 dipolar groups as&#160;the matrix (F&#8208;PI) and trace organic semiconductor as charge traps deliver an excellent discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90&#160;&#8776; 4.39 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C.








Abstract
The miniaturization of electronic devices and power systems for capacitive energy storage under harsh environments requires scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin high&#8208;temperature dielectric films. To meet the need, ultrasonic spray&#8208;coating (USC) can be used. Novel polyimides with a dipolar group, &#63743;CF3 (F&#8208;PI), and all&#8208;organic composites with trace organic semiconductor can serve as models. These scalable high&#8208;quality ultrathin films (&#8776;2.6 and &#8776;5.2&#160;&#181;m) are successfully fabricated via USC. The high quality of the films is evaluated from the micro&#8208;millimeter scale to the sub&#8208;millimeter and above. The high glass transition temperature Tg (&#8776;340 &#176;C) and concurrent large bandgap Eg (&#8776;3.53&#160;eV) induced by weak conjugation from considerable interchain distance (&#8776;6.2 &#197;) enable F&#8208;PI to be an excellent matrix delivering a discharge energy density with 90% discharge efficiency U&#951;90 of 2.85 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C. Further, the incorporation of a trace organic semiconductor leads to a record U&#951;90 of &#8776;4.39 J cm&#8722;3 at 200 &#176;C due to the markedly enhanced breakdown strength caused by deep charge traps of &#8776;2&#160;eV. Also, a USC&#8208;fabricated multilayer F&#8208;PI foil capacitor with &#8776;85&#160;nF (six layers) has good performance at 150 &#176;C. These results confirm that USC is an excellent technology to fabricate high&#8208;quality ultrathin dielectric films and capacitors.

         <title>Ultrathin Cellulose Nanofiber Assisted Ambient&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Dried, Ultralight, Mechanically Robust, Multifunctional MXene Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ambient&#8208;pressure&#8208;dried (APD) preparation of transition metal carbide/nitrides (MXene) aerogels is highly desirable yet remains highly challenging. Here, ultrathin, high&#8208;strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight&#8208;ratio, renewable cellulose nanofibers (CNFs) are efficiently utilized to assist in the APD preparation of ultralight yet robust, highly conductive, large&#8208;area MXene&#8208;based aerogels via a facile, energy&#8208;efficient, eco&#8208;friendly, and scalable freezing&#8208;exchanging&#8208;drying approach. The strong interactions of large&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio CNF and MXene as well as the biomimetic nacre&#8208;like microstructure induce high mechanical strength and stability to avoid the structure collapse of aerogels in the APD process. Abundant functional groups of CNFs facilitate the chemical crosslinking of MXene&#8208;based aerogels, significantly improving the hydrophobicity, water resistance, and even oxidation stability. The ultrathin, one&#8208;dimensional nature of the CNF renders the minimal MXenes&#8217; interlayered gaps and numerous heterogeneous interfaces, yielding the excellent conductivity and electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding performance of aerogels. The synergies of the MXene, CNF, and abundant pores efficiently improve the EMI shielding performance, photothermal conversion, and absorption of viscous crude oil. Our work shows great promises of the APD, multifunctional MXene&#8208;based aerogels in electromagnetic protection or compatibility, thermal therapy, and oil&#8208;water separation applications.

         <title>Controlling Mineralization with Protein&#8208;Functionalized Peptoid Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Sequence&#8208;defined foldamers that self&#8208;assemble into well&#8208;defined architectures are promising scaffolds to template inorganic mineralization. However, it has been challenging to achieve robust control of nucleation and growth without sequence redesign or extensive experimentation. Using peptoid nanotubes functionalized with a panel of solid&#8208;binding proteins, we mineralize homogeneously distributed and monodisperse anatase nanocrystals from the water&#8208;soluble TiBALDH precursor. We demonstrate that crystallite size can be tuned between 1.4 and 4.4 nm, by changing protein coverage and the identity and valency of the genetically engineered solid&#8208;binding segments. We expand on the approach by synthesizing gold nanoparticles on nanotube sidewalls and produce titania/gold nanocomposites capable of photocatalysis under visible light illumination using a protein encoding both material&#8208;binding specificities. Beyond uncovering critical roles for hierarchical organization and denticity on solid&#8208;binding protein mineralization outcomes, the strategy described herein should prove valuable for the fabrication of hierarchical hybrid materials incorporating a broad range of inorganic components.

         <title>Edible, Ultra&#8208;strong, and Thermal&#8208;stable Seaweed&#8208;based Structural Material for Tableware</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Widely used disposable plastic tableware is usually buried or directly discharged into the natural environment after using, which poses potential threats to the natural environment and human health. To solve this problem, the non&#8208;degradable plastic tableware needs to be replaced by the tableware composing of biodegradable structural materials with both the food safety and the excellent mechanical and thermal properties. Here, a food&#8208;safe sargassum cellulose nanofiber (SCNF) is extracted from the common seaweed in an efficient and low energy consuming way under mild reaction conditions. Then, by assembling the SCNF into a dense bulk material, a strong sargassum cellulose nanofiber structural material (SCNSM) with high strength (283&#160;MPa) and high thermal stability (&gt;160&#176;C) can be prepared. The SCNSM also possess good machinability, which can be processed into tableware with different shapes, e.g., knives and forks. The overall performance of the SCNSM&#8208;based tableware is better than commercial plastic, wood&#8208;based, and poly(lactic acid) tableware, which shows great application potential in the tableware field.

         <title>Probing the Mechanically Stable Solid Electrolyte Interphase and the Implications in Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The inevitable volume expansion of secondary battery anodes during cycling imposes forces on the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). The battery performance is closely related to the capability of SEI to maintain intact under the cyclic loading conditions, which basically boils down to the mechanical properties of SEI. The volatile and complex nature of SEI as well as its nanoscale thickness and environmental sensitivity make the interpretation of its mechanical behaviour many roadblocks. Widely varied approaches have been adopted to investigate the mechanical properties of SEI, and diverse opinions have been generated. The lack of consensus at both technical and theoretical levels has hindered the development of effective design strategies to maximize the mechanical stability of SEIs. In this review, we outline the essential and desirable mechanical properties of SEI, the available mechanical characterization methods, and important issues meriting attention for higher test accuracy. We also scrutinize previous attempts to optimize battery performance by tuning SEI mechanical properties, elucidate inconsistencies in these efforts and explore the underlying causes. Finally, we propose a set of research protocols to accelerate the achievement of superior battery cycling performance by improving the mechanical stability of SEI.

         <title>Dynamic Sustainable Polyimide Film Combining Hardness with Softness via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; Bionic Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Dielectric polyimides are ubiquitous as insulation in electrical power systems and electronic devices. Generally, dynamic polyimide is required to solve electrical or mechanical damage et&#160;al. irreversible failure processes under high temperature, pressure and field strength. The challenge lies in the design of the molecular structure of rigid polyimide to achieve dynamic reversibility. Herein, a low molecular weight polyimide gene unit is designed to crosslink with polyimide ligase to prepare the smart film. Interestingly, due to the variability of gene unit and ligase combinations, the polyimide films combining hardness with softness are designed into three forms via a &#8220;Mimosa&#8208;like&#8221; bionic strategy to adapt to different application scenarios. Meanwhile, the films have good degradation efficiency, excellent recyclability and can self&#8208;healable, which makes them reuse. Clearly, the films can be used in the preparation of ultra&#8208;fast sensors with response time &#8764;0.15 s and the application of corona resistant films with 100% recovery. Furthermore, the construction of PI and carbon fiber reinforced composites have been verified to apply to the worse environment. Nicely, the composites have the property of multiple cycles and the non&#8208;destructive recycle rate of carbon fiber is as high as 100%. Design idea of preparing high strength dynamic polyimide by crosslinking simple polyimide gene unit with ligase could provide a good foundation and a clear case for the sustainable development of electrical and electronic polyimides, from the fancy perspective of Mimosa bionics.

         <title>Reconstruction of Thiospinel to Active Sites and Spin Channels for Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water electrolysis is a promising technique for carbon neutral hydrogen production. A great challenge remains at developing robust and low&#8208;cost anode catalysts. Many pre&#8208;catalysts have been found to undergo surface reconstruction to give high intrinsic activity in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The reconstructed oxyhydroxides on the surface are active species and most of them outperform directly synthesized oxyhydroxides. The reason for the high intrinsic activity remains to be explored. Here, we report a study to showcase the unique reconstruction behaviors of a pre&#8208;catalyst, thiospinel CoFe2S4, and its reconstruction chemistry for a high OER activity. The reconstruction of CoFe2S4 gives a mixture with both Fe&#8208;S component and active oxyhydroxide (Co(Fe)OxHy) because Co is more inclined to reconstruct as oxyhydroxide, while the Fe is more stable in Fe&#8208;S component in a major form of Fe3S4. The interface spin channel is demonstrated in the reconstructed CoFe2S4, which optimizes the energetics of OER steps on Co(Fe)OxHy species and facilitates the spin sensitive electron transfer to reduce the kinetic barrier of O&#8208;O coupling. The advantage is also demonstrated in a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer. This work introduces the feasibility of engineering the reconstruction chemistry of the pre&#8208;catalyst for high performance and durable MEA electrolyzers.

         <title>Mesoporous PdN Alloy Nanocubes for Efficient Electrochemical Nitrate Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is earnestly important to synthesize recyclable ammonia (NH3) in an economic and environment&#8208;friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium&#8208;nonmetal (meso&#8208;PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH3. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing highly active and selective electrocatalysts for electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) is earnestly important to synthesize recyclable ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in an economic and environment-friendly manner. Despite some encouraging progress, their activity and selectivity have been remarkably slower than expected. In this manuscript, mesoporous palladium-nonmetal (meso-PdX) nanocubes (NCs) are reported as a new series of highly efficient electrocatalysts for selective nitrate reduction reaction (NITRR) electrocatalysis to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The samples feature uniformly alloyed compositions and highly penetrated mesopores with abundant highly active sites and optimized electronic structures. The best meso-PdN NCs hold an outstanding NITRR activity and selectivity with a remarkable NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; Faradaic efficiency of 96.1% and a yield rate of 3760&#160;&#956;g h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; mg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, suppressing the state-of-the-art electrocatalysts. Meanwhile, meso-PdN NCs are electrocatalytically stable, retaining well the activity and selectivity of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Detailed mechanism studies ascribe the superior performance to combined compositional and structural synergies of meso-PdN NCs that not only promote the adsorption (reactivity) of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Mixed&#8208;Dimensional Pt&#8208;Ni Alloy Polyhedral Nanochains As Bifunctional Electrocatalysts for Direct Methanol Fuel Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Pt nanocatalysts play a critical role in direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) due to their appropriate adsorption/desorption energy, yet suffer from an unbalanced relationship between size&#8208;dependent activity and stability. Herein, mixed&#8208;dimensional Pt&#8208;Ni alloy polyhedral nanochains (Pt&#8208;Ni PNCs) with the ordered assembly of nanopolyhedral&#8208;nanowire&#8208;nanopolyhedral architecture are fabricated as bifunctional electrocatalysts for DMFCs, effectively alleviating the size effect. The Pt&#8208;Ni PNCs exhibit 7.23 times higher mass activity for anodic methanol oxidation reaction (MOR) than that of commercial Pt/C. In situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and CO stripping measurements demonstrate the prominent stability of the Pt&#8208;Ni PNCs to resist CO poisoning. For cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), a positive half&#8208;wave potential exceeding Pt/C is achieved by the Pt&#8208;Ni PNCs and it can be well maintained for 10,000 cycles with negligible activity decay. The designed nanostructure can alleviate the agglomeration and dissolution problems of zero&#8208;dimensional small&#8208;sized Pt&#8208;Ni alloy nanocrystals and enrich surface atom steps and active facets of one&#8208;dimensional chain&#8208;like nanostructures. This work provides a proposed strategy to improve the catalytic performance of Pt&#8208;based nanocatalysts by constructing novel interfacial relationships in mixed dimensions to alleviate the imbalance between catalytic activity and catalytic stability caused by size effects.

         <title>A Hemispherical Image Sensor Array Fabricated with Organic Photo&#8208;memory Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hemispherical image sensors simplify lens designs, reduce optical aberrations, and improve image resolution for compact wide&#8208;field&#8208;of&#8208;view cameras. To achieve hemispherical image sensors, organic materials are promising candidates due to the following advantages: tunability of optoelectronic/spectral response and low&#8208;temperature low&#8208;cost processes. Here, we developed a photolithographic process to prepare a hemispherical image sensor array using organic thin film photo&#8208;memory transistors with a density of 308 pixels per square centimeter. Our design includes only one photo&#8208;memory transistor as a single active pixel, in contrast to the conventional pixel architecture, consisting of select/readout/reset transistors and a photodiode. Our organic photo&#8208;memory transistor, comprising light&#8208;sensitive organic semiconductor and charge&#8208;trapping dielectric, is able to achieve linear photo&#8208;response (light intensity range, from 1 to 50&#160;W m&#8722;2), along with responsivity as high as 1.6 A W&#8722;1 (wavelength = 465&#160;nm) for a dark current of 0.24 A m&#8722;2 (drain voltage = &#8208;1.5&#160;V). These observed values represent the best responsivity for similar dark currents among all the reported hemispherical image sensor arrays to date. We further developed a transfer method that does not damage organic materials for hemispherical organic photo&#8208;memory transistor arrays. Our developed techniques are scalable and are amenable for other high&#8208;resolution 3&#8208;dimensional organic semiconductor devices.

         <title>Braiding Lateral Morphotropic Grain Boundary in Homogeneitic Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Interfaces formed by correlated oxides offer a critical avenue for discovering emergent phenomena and quantum states. However, the fabrication of oxide interfaces with variable crystallographic orientations and strain states integrated along a film plane is extremely challenge by conventional layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking or self&#8208;assembling. Here, we report the creation of morphotropic grain boundaries (GBs) in laterally interconnected cobaltite homostructures. Single&#8208;crystalline substrates and suspended ultrathin freestanding membranes provide independent templates for coherent epitaxy and constraint on the growth orientation, resulting in seamless and atomically sharp GBs. Electronic states and magnetic behavior in hybrid structures are laterally modulated and isolated by GBs, enabling artificially engineered functionalities in the planar matrix. Our work offers a simple and scalable method for fabricating unprecedented innovative interfaces through controlled synthesis routes as well as provides a platform for exploring potential applications in neuromorphics, solid state batteries, and catalysis.

         <title>Heterogeneous Strain Distribution&#8208;Based Programmable Gated Microchannel for Ultrasensitive and Stable Strain Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing highly sensitive strain sensors requires conduction pathways capable of rapidly switching between disconnection and reconnection in response to strain. Ion channels in living organisms exactly control the channel switch through protein&#8208;composed gates, achieving changeable ion currents. Herein, inspired by the gating characteristics of the ion channels, a programmable fluidic strain sensor enhanced by gating ion pathways through heterogeneous strain distribution of discrete micropillars is proposed. During stretching, the contraction and closure of the widthwise gaps between discrete micropillars greatly weaken or even nearly cut off the conduction pathway, resulting in orders of magnitude increase in resistance and thus ultra&#8208;high sensitivity. By adjusting the combination form and structural parameters of the discrete micropillars in the fluidic channel, the sensitivity and strain range can be customized. Thus, a gauge factor of up to 45,300 and a stretch range of 590% are obtained. Benefiting from the fluidic gating mechanism, no mechanical mismatch can be observed at the interface, breaking through the sensing stability issue of flexible sensors. The proposed sensor can be used to detect the full range of human motion, and integrated into a data glove to achieve human&#8208;machine interaction.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Asperities for Pressure Tunable Adhesion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Control of adhesion is important in a host of applications including soft robotics, pick&#8208;and&#8208;place manufacturing, wearable devices, and transfer printing. While there are adhesive systems with discrete switchability between states of high and low adhesion, achieving continuously variable adhesion strength remains a challenge. In this work, we present a versatile and scalable pressure tunable adhesive (PTA) that is based on the self&#8208;assembly of stiff microscale asperities on an elastomeric substrate. We demonstrate that the adhesion strength of the PTA increases with the applied compressive preload due to the unique contact formation mechanism caused by the asperities. Additionally, we develop a contact mechanics model to explain the resulting trends. For a specific PTA design, the critical pull&#8208;off force can be increased from 0.4&#160;mN to 30&#160;mN by increasing the applied preload from 1&#160;mN to 30&#160;mN. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of precision control of adhesion strength by utilizing the PTA for pick&#8208;and&#8208;place material handling. Our approach in pressure tunable adhesive design based on self&#8208;assembly of asperities presents a scalable and versatile approach that is applicable to a variety of material systems having different mechanical or surface properties.

         <title>Acoustic Crystallization of Two&#8208;dimensional Colloidal Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional colloidal crystallization provides a simple strategy to produce defined nanostructure arrays over macroscopic areas. Regularity and long&#8208;range order of such crystals is essential to ensure functionality, but difficult to achieve in self&#8208;assembling systems. Here, we introduce a simple loudspeaker setup for the acoustic crystallization of two&#8208;dimensional crystals (ACDC) of polystyrene, microgels, and core&#8208;shell colloidal particles at liquid interfaces. This setup anneals an interfacial colloidal monolayer and affords an increase in average grain size by almost two orders of magnitude. We characterize the order via the structural color of the colloidal crystal, optimize the acoustic annealing process via the frequency and the amplitude of the applied sound wave and rationalize its efficiency via the surface coverage&#8208;dependent interactions within the interfacial colloidal monolayer. Computer simulations show that multiple rearrangement mechanisms at different length scales, from the local rearrangement around voids to grain boundary movement via consecutive particle rotations around common centers, collude to remove defects. The experimentally simple ACDC process, paired with the demonstrated applicability towards complex particle systems, provides access to highly&#8208;defined nanostructure arrays for a wide range of research communities.

         <title>A Switchable One&#8208;Compound Diode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A diode or transistor requires the combination of p&#8208; and n&#8208;type semiconductors or at least the defined formation of such areas within a given compound. This is a prerequisite for any IT application, energy conversion technology, and electronic semiconductor devices. Since 2009, when the first pnp&#8208;switchable compound Ag10Te4Br3 was described, it is in principle possible to fabricate a diode from a single material without adjusting the semiconduction type by a defined doping level. After this discovery, a handful of other materials that are capable of reversibly switching between these two semiconducting stages was reported. In all cases, a structural phase transition accompanied by a dynamic change of charge carriers or a charge density wave (CDW) within certain substructures are responsible for this effect. Unfortunately, a certain feature hinders the application of this phenomenon in convenient devices, namely the pnp&#8208;switching temperature, which generally occurs well above room temperature, between 364 and 580 K. This effect is far removed from a suitable operation temperature at ambient conditions. Here, we report on Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3, a room temperature pnp&#8208;switching material, and the realization of the first single&#8208;material position&#8208;independent diode. The title compound shows the highest ever reported Seebeck coefficient drop that takes place within a few Kelvin at room temperature. Combined with its reasonably low thermal conductivity, this material offers great application potential within an easily accessible and applicable temperature window. Ag18Cu3Te11Cl3 and pnp&#8208;switching materials have the potential for applications and processes where diodes, transistors, or any defined charge separation with junction formation are utilized.

         <title>Controllable Gold Nanocluster&#8211;Emulsion Interface for Direct Cell Penetration and Photothermal Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In view of their ability to be uptaken by cells, colloidal particles can exert diverse physiological effects and are promising vehicles for the intracellular delivery of biologically active substances. Given that the modulation of biomaterial interfaces greatly facilitates the prediction and control of the corresponding cellular responses, we rationally designed the interfacial behavior of hydrophobic dye&#8211;modified Au nanoclusters (Au NCs) to develop Au NC&#8211;containing emulsions and control their biointerfacial interactions with cell membranes. The observed biological performance was indicative of a physical penetration mechanism. The amphiphilic Au NCs decreased the interfacial energy of two immiscible liquids and hindered droplet coalescence to facilitate the formation of emulsions thermodynamically stabilized by dipole&#8208;dipole and hydrophobic interactions. Moreover, the amphiphilic Au NCs were localized on the emulsion droplet surface and formed segregated interfacial microdomains that adapted to the membrane structure and facilitated the traverse of the emulsions across the cell membrane via direct penetration. Fast penetration coupled with excellent photophysical performance endowed the emulsions with multifluorescence tracing and efficient photothermal killing capabilities. The successful change of the interaction mode between NCs and biological objects and the provision of a universal formulation to modulate biointerfacial interactions are expected to inspire new bioapplications.

         <title>Regulation of Polymer Configurations Enables Green Solvent&#8208;Processed Large&#8208;Area Binary All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells with Breakthrough Performance and High Efficiency Stretchability Factor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
As the great potential of the all&#8208;polymer solar cells for large&#8208;area wearable devices, both large&#8208;area device efficiency and mechanical flexibility are very critical but attract limited attention, and there is still a lack of comprehensive evaluation of the overall device performance. In this work, from the perspective of the polymer configurations, two types of terpolymer acceptors PYTX&#8208;A and PYTX&#8208;B (X = Cl or H) are developed. The configuration difference caused by the replacement of non&#8208;conjugated units results in distinct photovoltaic performance and mechanical flexibility. PYTX&#8208;A obtains an impressive efficiency of 16.16%, while PYTX&#8208;B obtains a champion crack onset strain (COS) of 22.74%. Benefiting from a good match between the intrinsically slow film&#8208;forming of the active materials and the technically slow film&#8208;forming of the blade&#8208;coating process, the toluene&#8208;processed large&#8208;area (1.21cm2) binary device achieves a record efficiency of 14.70%. More importantly, a new parameter of efficiency stretchability factor (ESF) is proposed for the first time to comprehensively evaluate the overall device performance. PM6:PYTCl&#8208;A and PM6:PYTCl&#8208;B yield an ESF of 2.78% and 2.54%, respectively, which are both significantly higher than PM6:PY&#8208;IT (ESF = 1.50%). Further blending with non&#8208;conjugated polymer donor PM6&#8208;A, the best ESF of 3.12% is achieved for PM6&#8208;A:PYTCl&#8208;A, which is among the highest comprehensive performance.

         <title>Extremely Suppressed Energetic Disorder in a Chemically Doped Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemical doping can be used to tune the optoelectronic properties of conjugated polymers (CPs), extending their applications as conducting materials. Unfortunately, chemically doped CP films containing excess dopants exhibit an increase in energetic disorder upon structural alteration, and Coulomb interactions between charge carriers and dopants also affect such disorder. The increase in energetic disorder leads to a broadening of the density of states, which consequently impedes efficient charge transport in chemically doped CPs. However, the molecular origins that inherently resistant to such incidental increase of energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs has not been sufficiently explored. Here, we discover that energetic disorder in chemically doped CPs can be suppressed to a level close to the theoretical limit. Indacenodithiophene&#8208;co&#8208;benzothiadiazole (IDTBT) doped with triethyloxonium hexachloroantimonate (OA) exhibits disorder&#8208;free charge transport characteristics and band&#8208;like transport behavior with astonishing carrier mobility as a result of reinforced one&#8208;dimensional intramolecular transport. Molecular structure of IDTBT provides a capability to lower the energetic disorder that generally arises from the inclusion of heterogeneous dopants. Our results suggest the possibilities of implementing of disorder&#8208;free CPs that exhibit excellent charge transport characteristics in the chemically doped state and of satisfying a prerequisite for their availability in industry.

         <title>Hyperelastic Kevlar Nanofiber Aerogels as Robust Thermal Switches for Smart Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Aerogels, the lightest artificial solid materials characterized by low density and thermal conductivity, high porosity, and large specific surface area, have attracted increasing interest. Aerogels exhibit single&#8208;mode thermal insulation properties regardless of the surrounding temperature. In this study, hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are designed and fabricated by a slow proton release&#8208;modulating gelation and thermo&#8208;induced cross&#8208;linking strategy. The method does not use cross&#8208;linking agents and endows the ultra&#8208;low&#8208;density (4.7 mg&#183;cm&#8722;3) HEKAs with low thermal conductivity (0.029 W&#183;m&#8722;1&#183;K&#8722;1), high porosity (99.75%), high thermal stability (550&#176;C), and increased compression resilience (80%) and fatigue resistance. Proofs of the concept of the HEKAs acting as on&#8208;off thermal switches are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. The thermal switches exhibit a rapid thermal response speed of 0.73&#176;C&#183;s&#8722;1, high heat flux of 2044 J&#183;m&#8722;2&#183;s&#8722;1, and switching ratio of 7.5. Heat dissipation can be reversibly switched on/off more than fifty times owing to the hyperelasticity and fatigue resistance of HEKAs.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aerogels, the lightest artificial solid materials characterized by low density and thermal conductivity, high porosity, and large specific surface area, have attracted increasing interest. Aerogels exhibit single-mode thermal insulation properties regardless of the surrounding temperature. In this study, hyperelastic Kevlar nanofiber aerogels (HEKAs) are designed and fabricated by a slow proton release-modulating gelation and thermo-induced cross-linking strategy. The method does not use cross-linking agents and endows the ultra-low-density (4.7 mg&#183;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;) HEKAs with low thermal conductivity (0.029 W&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), high porosity (99.75%), high thermal stability (550&#176;C), and increased compression resilience (80%) and fatigue resistance. Proofs of the concept of the HEKAs acting as on-off thermal switches are demonstrated through experiments and simulations. The thermal switches exhibit a rapid thermal response speed of 0.73&#176;C&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, high heat flux of 2044 J&#183;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, and switching ratio of 7.5. Heat dissipation can be reversibly switched on/off more than fifty times owing to the hyperelasticity and fatigue resistance of HEKAs. This study suggests a route to fulfill the hyperelasticity of highly porous aerogels and to tailor heat flux on-demand.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal in vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of circulating tumor cell (CTC) removal can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITD, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here, we present a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, our work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Corrosion&#8208;resistant and high&#8208;entropic non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal electrodes for oxygen evolution in acidic media</title>

Abstract
To realize sustainable hydrogen economy, corrosion&#8208;resistant non&#8208;noble&#8208;metal catalysts are needed to replace noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts. The combination of passivation elements and catalytically active elements is crucial for simultaneously achieving high corrosion resistance and high catalytic activity. Herein, the self&#8208;selection/reconstruction characteristics of multi&#8208;element (nonary) alloys that could automatically redistribute suitable elements and rearrange surface structures under the target reaction conditions during the oxygen evolution reaction are investigated. The following synergetic effect (i.e., cocktail effect), among the elements Ti, Zr, Nb, and Mo, significantly contributes to passivation, whereas Cr, Co, Ni, Mn, and Fe enhance the catalytic activity. According to the practical water electrolysis experiments, the self&#8208;selected/reconstructed multi&#8208;element alloy demonstrates high performance under a similar condition with proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;type water electrolysis without obvious degradation during stability tests. This verifies the resistance of the alloy to corrosion when used as an electrode under a practical PEM electrolysis condition.

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
This work demonstrates the atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the two&#8208;dimensional nature of the Sb2Te3 enabled the growth of an in&#8208;situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film showed a reduced reset current of &#8764; 1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching was induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhanced the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enabled such a significant improvement. Set operation switched the amorphous to the (111)&#8208;oriented FCC structure.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Prolamin Scaffolds for Cell&#8208;based Meat Culture</title>

Abstract
Cultivating meat from muscle stem cells in vitro requires three&#8208;dimensional (3D) edible scaffolds as the supporting matrix. Electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing is an emerging 3D&#8208;printing technology for fabricating ultrafine fibrous scaffolds with high precision microstructures for biomedical applications. However, edible EHD&#8208;printed scaffolds remain scarce in cultured meat production partly due to special requirements with regard to the printability of ink. Here we mixed hordein or secalin, which are cereal prolamins extracted from barley or rye, with zein to produce pure prolamin&#8208;based inks, which exhibit favorable printability similar to common polycaprolactone (PCL) ink. Zein/hordein and zein/secalin scaffolds with highly ordered tessellated structures were successfully fabricated after optimizing printing conditions. The prolamin scaffolds demonstrated good water stability and in vitro degradability due to the porous fiber surface, which was spontaneously generated by culturing muscle cells for one week. Moreover, mouse skeletal myoblasts (C2C12) and porcine skeletal muscle satellite cells (PSCs) could adhere and proliferate on the fibrous matrix, and a cultured meat slice was produced by culturing PSCs on prolamin scaffolds with high tissue similarity. The upregulation of myogenic proteins shows that the differentiation process was triggered in the 3D culture, demonstrating the great potential of prolamin scaffolds in cultured meat production.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Interface&#8208;Reinforced Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance and Mechanical Reliability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two key interfaces on either side of the metal&#8208;halide perovskite thin film in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are reinforced simultaneously. This new class of dual&#8208;interface&#8208;reinforced f&#8208;PSCs has an unprecedented combination of high efficiency (21.03%), improved operational stability (1000 h T90), and enhanced mechanical reliability (10 000 cycles n88). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.








Abstract
Two key interfaces in flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) are mechanically reinforced simultaneously: one between the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) and the 3D metal&#8208;halide perovskite (MHP) thin film using self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM), and the other between the 3D&#8208;MHP thin film and the hole&#8208;transport layer (HTL) using an in situ grown low&#8208;dimensional (LD) MHP capping layer. The interfacial mechanical properties are measured and modeled. This rational interface engineering results in the enhancement of not only the mechanical properties of both interfaces but also their optoelectronic properties holistically. As a result, the new class of dual&#8208;interface&#8208;reinforced f&#8208;PSCs has an unprecedented combination of the following three important performance parameters: high power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.03% (with reduced hysteresis), improved operational stability of 1000&#160;h T90 (duration at 90% initial PCE retained), and enhanced mechanical reliability of 10 000 cycles n88 (number of bending cycles at 88% initial PCE retained). The scientific underpinnings of these synergistic enhancements are elucidated.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Jet Fusion 3D Voxel Printing of Conductive Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Voxelated parts with site&#8208;specific electrical properties are built using a newly developed multifunctional agent. The conductive components in the agent are programmed to be dispensed in the designated regions of the polymer matrix during printing, enabling exquisite control over the electrical conductivity (in a range of nine orders of magnitude) of the printed parts at a voxel resolution of &#8776;100 &#181;m.








Abstract
3D voxel printing enables the fabrication of parts with site&#8208;specific materials and properties at voxel&#8208;scale resolution, while the current research mainly focuses on the variations in mechanical properties and colors. In this work,&#160;the design and fabrication of voxelated conductive elastomers using Multi Jet Fusion 3D voxel printing actualized by a newly developed multifunctional agent (MA) are investigated. The MA, mainly consisting of carbon nanotubes and poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate, serves&#160;as an infrared&#8208;absorbing colorant, a reinforcement, and a conductive filler simultaneously. By controlling the drop&#8208;on&#8208;demand dispensing of the agents on thermoplastic polyurethane powder, the electrical conductivity across a single printed part can be tailored over a wide range from 10&#8722;10 to 10&#8722;1 S cm&#8722;1 at a voxel resolution of &#8776;100&#160;&#181;m. Assembly&#8208;free strain sensors comprising conductive sensing layers and insulating frames are fabricated to demonstrate the capability of the technique in manufacturing all&#8208;printed wearable devices.

         <title>Freestanding and Scalable Force&#8208;Softness Bimodal Sensor Arrays for Haptic Body&#8208;Feature Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Freestanding and scalable tactile platforms with force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays are developed, enabling a tactile glove to digitalize pressing force and softness in large areas of the human body. Combining with machine&#8208;learning methods, the tactile glove identifies body features in a real person and a medical abdominal simulator with high accuracy (98%).








Abstract
Tactile technologies that can identify human body features are valuable in clinical diagnosis and human&#8211;machine interactions. Previously, cutting&#8208;edge tactile platforms have been able to&#160;identify structured non&#8208;living objects; however, identification of human body features remains challenging mainly because of the irregular contour and heterogeneous spatial distribution of softness. Here, freestanding and scalable tactile platforms of force&#8208;softness bimodal sensor arrays are developed, enabling tactile gloves to identify body features using machine&#8208;learning methods. The bimodal sensors are engineered by adding a protrusion on a piezoresistive pressure sensor, endowing the resistance signals with combined information of pressure and the softness of samples. The simple design enables 112 bimodal sensors to be integrated into a thin, conformal, and stretchable tactile glove, allowing the tactile information to be digitalized while hand skills are performed on the human body. The tactile glove shows high accuracy (98%) in identifying four body features of a real person, and four organ models (healthy and pathological) inside an abdominal simulator, demonstrating identification of body features of the bimodal tactile platforms and showing their potential use in future healthcare and robotics.

         <title>Quantification of the Electromechanical Measurements by Piezoresponse Force Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coexistence of the regions with positive and negative piezoelectricity within the 20 nm&#8208;thick La:HfO2 capacitor is revealed by piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) local spectroscopy and imaging. A PFM loop obtained in region L1 exhibits a negative piezoelectric coefficient, while a mirror&#8208;reflected PFM loop is obtained from region L2 with positive piezoelectricity.








Abstract
Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) is widely used for characterization and exploration of the nanoscale properties of ferroelectrics. However, quantification of the PFM signal is challenging due to the convolution of various extrinsic and intrinsic contributions. Although quantification of the PFM amplitude signal has received considerable attention, quantification of the PFM phase signal has not been addressed. A properly calibrated PFM phase signal can provide valuable information on the sign of the local piezoelectric coefficient&#8212;an important and nontrivial issue for emerging ferroelectrics. In this work, two complementary methodologies to calibrate the PFM phase signal are discussed. The first approach is based on using a standard reference sample with well&#8208;known independently measured piezoelectric coefficients, while the second approach exploits&#160;the electrostatic sample&#8211;cantilever interactions to determine the parasitic phase offset. Application of these methodologies to studies of the piezoelectric behavior in ferroelectric HfO2&#8208;based thin&#8208;film capacitors reveals intriguing variations in the sign of the longitudinal piezoelectric coefficient, d33,eff. It is shown that the piezoelectric properties of the HfO2&#8208;based capacitors are inherently sensitive to their thickness, electrodes, as well as deposition methods, and can exhibit wide variations including a d33,eff sign change within a single device.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Transport Layers Employing Strongly Bound Ligands Enhance Stability in Colloidal Quantum Dot Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dot (CQD) photodetectors operating at 1450 nm, based on CQD electron&#8208;transport layers (ETLs) are demonstrated, and they achieve superior performance to previous works that rely on metal oxide ETLs. A strategy employing strongly bound organic carboxylate ligands to suppress ion migration inside the ETL and enable the stable operation of CQD photodetectors is developed.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processed photodetectors based on colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising candidates for short&#8208;wavelength infrared light sensing applications. Present&#8208;day CQD photodetectors employ a CQD active layer sandwiched between carrier&#8208;transport layers in which the electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) is composed of metal oxides. Herein, a new class of ETLs is developed using n&#8208;type CQDs, finding that these benefit from quantum&#8208;size effect tuning of the band energies, as well as from surface ligand engineering. Photodetectors operating at 1450 nm are demonstrated using CQDs with tailored functionalities for each of the transport layers and the active layer. By optimizing the band alignment between the ETL and the active layer, CQD photodetectors that combine a low dark current of &#8776;1 &#215; 10&#8722;3 mA cm&#8722;2 with a high external quantum efficiency of &#8776;66% at 1&#160;V are reported, outperforming prior reports of CQD photodetectors operating at &gt;1400 nm that rely on metal oxides as ETLs. It is shown that stable CQD photodetectors rely on well&#8208;passivated CQDs: for ETL CQDs, a strongly bound organic ligand trans&#8208;4&#8208;(trifluoromethyl)cinnamic acid (TFCA) provides improved passivation compared to the weakly bound inorganic ligand tetrabutylammonium iodide (TBAI). TFCA suppresses bias&#8208;induced ion migration inside the ETL and improves the operating stability of photodetectors by 50&#215; compared to TBAI.

         <title>Spatial Band Separation in a Surface Doped Heterolayered Structure for Realizing Efficient Singlet Oxygen Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Surface iodine doping in Bi2O2SiO3 facilitates spatial redistribution of the bands on alternating [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers, which promotes the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers, meanwhile optimizing the band positions. Benefiting from these features, iodine&#8208;doped Bi2O2SiO3 exhibits efficient 1O2 generation via the charge&#8208;transfer mechanism, manifesting high conversion yield and selectivity for various thioethers in selective sulfide oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Singlet oxygen (1O2) with electrical neutrality and long lifetime holds great promise in producing high&#8208;added&#8208;value chemicals via a selective oxidation reaction. However, photocatalytic 1O2 generation via the charge&#8208;transfer mechanism still suffers from low efficiency due to the mismatched redox capacities and low concentration of photogenerated carriers in confined systems. Herein, by taking bismuth oxysilicate (Bi2O2SiO3) with alternating heterogeneous layered structure as a model, it is shown that iodine doping can facilitate the spatial redistributions of bands on alternated [Bi2O2] and [SiO3] layers, which can promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the band positions of Bi2O2SiO3 are optimized to match the redox potential of 1O2 generation. Benefiting from these features, iodine&#8208;doped Bi2O2SiO3 exhibits efficient 1O2 generation with respect to its pristine counterpart, leading to promoted performance in the selective sulfide oxidation reaction. A new strategy is offered here for optimizing charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;mediated 1O2 generation.

Benefiting from these features, iodine-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits efficient &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation via the charge-transfer mechanism, manifesting high conversion yield and selectivity for various thioethers in selective sulfide oxidation reaction.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Singlet oxygen (&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) with electrical neutrality and long lifetime holds great promise in producing high-added-value chemicals via a selective oxidation reaction. However, photocatalytic &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation via the charge-transfer mechanism still suffers from low efficiency due to the mismatched redox capacities and low concentration of photogenerated carriers in confined systems. Herein, by taking bismuth oxysilicate (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with alternating heterogeneous layered structure as a model, it is shown that iodine doping can facilitate the spatial redistributions of bands on alternated [Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] layers, which can promote the separation and transfer of photogenerated charge carriers. Meanwhile, the band positions of Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are optimized to match the redox potential of &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation. Benefiting from these features, iodine-doped Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits efficient &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation with respect to its pristine counterpart, leading to promoted performance in the selective sulfide oxidation reaction. A new strategy is offered here for optimizing charge-transfer-mediated &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Carbon Surface Chemistry: New Insight into the Old Story</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The significant progress in the synthesis of novel carbon materials and the promising prospects of their applications in various advanced areas bring an unprecedented boom in the carbon community. In this work, properties of different defective structures related to carbon surface chemistry, which may lead to an important influence on their performance without being noticed, are discussed.








Abstract
The enormous complexity of the carbon material family has provoked a phenomenological approach to develop its potential in different applications. Although the electronic, chemical, mechanical, and magnetic properties of carbon materials have been widely discussed based on defect control engineering, there is still a lack of fundamental understanding of the carbon surface chemistry, which leads to many controversial conclusions. Here, by analyzing various defects on carbon surface, some commonly neglected aspects and misunderstandings in this field are pointed out, clarifying how surface chemistry affects the chemical behaviors of carbon in some specific chemical reactions. With this full&#8208;scale consideration of the carbon surface chemistry, the behaviors of carbon materials with various functions can be well defined, which is indispensable for their scalable applications. Perspectives on future developments of carbon surface chemistry are also provided to enable practically accessible design of advanced carbon in those applications.

         <title>Reversibly Controlled Ternary Polar States and Ferroelectric Bias Promoted by Boosting Square&#8208;Tensile&#8208;Strain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new cubic perovskite substrate BaZrO3 promotes an innovative ferroelectric state and functionality in heteroepitaxial BaTiO3 film through applications of square tensile strain. The isotropic strain induces intriguing four&#8208;variants polar domains of in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization. Cooperation between the built&#8208;in local point defect&#8208;dipole and the four&#8208;variants polar domains enables the reversible control of ternary polar states.








Abstract
Interaction between dipoles often emerges intriguing physical phenomena, such as exchange bias in the magnetic heterostructures and magnetoelectric effect in multiferroics, which lead to advances in multifunctional heterostructures. However, the defect&#8208;dipole tends to be considered the undesired to deteriorate the electronic functionality. Here, deterministic switching between the ferroelectric and the pinched states by exploiting a new substrate of cubic perovskite, BaZrO3 is reported, which boosts the square&#8208;tensile&#8208;strain to BaTiO3 and promotes four&#8208;variants in&#8208;plane spontaneous polarization with oxygen vacancy creation. First&#8208;principles calculations propose a complex of an oxygen vacancy and two Ti3+ ions coins a charge&#8208;neutral defect&#8208;dipole. Cooperative control of the defect&#8208;dipole and the spontaneous polarization reveals ternary in&#8208;plane polar states characterized by biased/pinched hysteresis loops. Furthermore, it is experimentally demonstrated that three electrically controlled polar&#8208;ordering states lead to switchable and nonvolatile dielectric states for application of nondestructive electro&#8208;dielectric memory. This discovery opens a new route to develop functional materials via manipulating defect&#8208;dipoles and offers a novel platform to advance heteroepitaxy beyond the prevalent perovskite substrates.

         <title>Simultaneously Enhancing Exciton/Charge Transport in Organic Solar Cells by an Organoboron Additive</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The exciton diffusion and charge transport of PM6:Y6&#8208;based organic solar cells are simultaneously enhanced by trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS), and the PM6:Y6:BBS devices achieve a higher efficiency of 17.6% relative to that without BBS (16.2%).








Abstract
Efficient exciton diffusion and charge transport play a vital role in advancing the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of organic solar cells (OSCs). Here, a facile strategy is presented to simultaneously enhance exciton/charge transport of the widely studied PM6:Y6&#8208;based OSCs by employing highly emissive trans&#8208;bis(dimesitylboron)stilbene (BBS) as a solid additive. BBS transforms the emissive sites from a more H&#8208;type aggregate into a more J&#8208;type aggregate, which benefits the resonance energy transfer for PM6 exciton diffusion and energy transfer from PM6 to Y6. Transient gated photoluminescence spectroscopy measurements indicate that addition of BBS improves the exciton diffusion coefficient of PM6 and the dissociation of PM6 excitons in the PM6:Y6:BBS film. Transient absorption spectroscopy measurements confirm faster charge generation in PM6:Y6:BBS. Moreover, BBS helps improve Y6 crystallization, and current&#8208;sensing atomic force microscopy characterization reveals an improved charge&#8208;carrier diffusion length in PM6:Y6:BBS. Owing to the enhanced exciton diffusion, exciton dissociation, charge generation, and charge transport, as well as reduced charge recombination and energy loss, a higher PCE of 17.6% with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current density, and fill factor is achieved for the PM6:Y6:BBS devices compared to the devices without BBS (16.2%).

         <title>Atomically Thin, Ionic&#8211;Covalent Organic Nanosheets for Stable, High&#8208;Performance Carbon Dioxide Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The methylation of cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based covalent organic nanosheets successfully introduces quaternary ammonium groups into the framework, and resolves the leaching problem of ionic catalysts. The steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion effect of ammonium groups benefit the formation of monolayer nanosheets and the exposure of active sites. Meanwhile, the cationic skeleton decreases the energy barrier for the *COOH formation and facilitates electrocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion.








Abstract
The incorporation of charged functional groups is effective to modulate the activity of molecular complexes for the CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), yet long&#8208;term heterogeneous electrolysis is often hampered by catalyst leaching. Herein, an electrocatalyst of atomically thin, cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based, ionic&#8211;covalent organic nanosheets (CoTAP&#8208;iCONs) is synthesized via a post&#8208;synthetic modification strategy for high&#8208;performance CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion. The cationic quaternary ammonium groups not only enable the formation of monolayer nanosheets due to steric hindrance and electrostatic repulsion, but also facilitate the formation of a *COOH intermediate, as suggested by theoretical calculations. Consequently, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs exhibit higher CO2RR activity than other cobalt&#8208;porphyrin&#8208;based structures: an 870% and 480% improvement of CO current densities compared to the monomer and neutral nanosheets, respectively. Additionally, the iCONs structure can accommodate the cationic moieties. In a flow cell, CoTAP&#8208;iCONs attain a very small onset overpotential of 40&#160;mV and a stable total current density of 212&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 with CO Faradaic efficiency of &gt;95% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V for 11&#160;h. Further coupling the flow electrolyzer with commercial solar cells yields a solar&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion efficiency of 13.89%. This work indicates that atom&#8208;thin, ionic nanosheets represent a promising structure for achieving both tailored activity and high stability.

In a flow cell, CoTAP-iCONs attain a very small onset overpotential of 40&#160;mV and a stable total current density of 212&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt; with CO Faradaic efficiency of &amp;gt;95% at &#8722;0.6&#160;V for 11&#160;h. Further coupling the flow electrolyzer with commercial solar cells yields a solar-to-CO conversion efficiency of 13.89%. This work indicates that atom-thin, ionic nanosheets represent a promising structure for achieving both tailored activity and high stability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmions with Unconventional Helicity Polarization in a Van Der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization are observed in a van der Waals ferromagnet Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2. The helicity of the dipole skyrmions in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is polarized, namely, the &#960;/2 and &#8722;&#960;/2 helicities are not equally populated. The short&#8208;range order of Fe split sites results in a localized Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities.








Abstract
Skyrmion helicity, which defines the spin swirling direction, is a fundamental parameter that may be utilized to encode data bits in future memory devices. Generally, in centrosymmetric ferromagnets, dipole skyrmions with helicity of &#8722;&#960;/2 and &#960;/2 are degenerate in energy, leading to equal populations of both helicities. On the other hand, in chiral materials where the Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction (DMI) prevails and the dipolar interaction is negligible, only a preferred helicity is selected by the type of DMI. However, whether there is a rigid boundary between these two regimes remains an open question. Herein, the observation of dipole skyrmions with unconventional helicity polarization in a van der Waals ferromagnet, Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2, is reported. Combining magnetometry, Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, electrical transport measurements, and micromagnetic simulations, the short&#8208;range superstructures in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 resulting in a localized DMI contribution, which breaks the degeneracy of the opposite helicities and leads to the helicity polarization, is demonstrated. Therefore, the helicity feature in Fe5&#8722;&#948;GeTe2 is controlled by both the dipolar interaction and DMI that the former leads to Bloch&#8208;type skyrmions with helicity of &#177;&#960;/2 whereas the latter breaks the helicity degeneracy. This work provides new insights into the skyrmion topology in van der Waals materials.

         <title>Judicious Design and Rapid Manufacturing of a Flexible, Mechanically Resistant Liquid&#8208;Like Coating with Strong Bonding and Antifouling Abilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid approach is reported for manufacture of liquid&#8208;like polymer coatings through judicious construction of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure under UV irradiation. Various liquids, including high&#8208;viscosity oils, can easily slide off the anti&#8208;adhesion surface. Furthermore, this robust coating is flexible and applicable for various substrates. Strikingly, it has a strong substrate bonding force both in air and underwater.








Abstract
Fluorine&#8208;free liquid&#8208;repellent coatings have been highly demanded for a variety of applications. However, rapid formation of coatings possessing outstanding oil repellency and strong bonding ability as well as good mechanical strength (e.g., bendability, impact resistance, and scratch resistance) remains a grand challenge. Herein, a robust strategy to rapidly create fluorine&#8208;free oil&#8208;repellent coatings in only 30 s via rational design of a semi&#8208;interpenetrating polymer network structure is reported. The resulting coating manifests strong bonding capability both in air and underwater. More importantly, it not only provides unprecedented oil repellency, even to high&#8208;viscosity crude oil, but also achieves both excellent bendability and hardness. This simple yet effective design strategy opens up a new avenue to manufacture multifunctional materials and devices with desirable features and structural complexities for applications in sustainable antifouling, drag reduction, nondestructive transportation, liquid collection, and biomedicine, among other areas.

         <title>Engineering 3d&#8211;2p&#8211;4f Gradient Orbital Coupling to Enhance Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel and feasible gradient orbital coupling strategy is proposed for tuning the oxygen reduction reaction performance through the construction of Co 3d&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Eu 4f unit sites on Eu2O3&#8211;Co model. This strategy&#160;optimizes the eg occupancy of Co sites, and weakens the O&#63742;O bond, and ultimately breaks the scaling relation between *OOH and *OH at Co&#8211;O&#8211;Eu unit sites.








Abstract
The development of highly efficient and economical materials for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) plays a key role in practical energy conversion technologies. However, the intrinsic scaling relations exert thermodynamic inhibition on realizing highly active ORR electrocatalysts. Herein, a novel and feasible gradient orbital coupling strategy for tuning the ORR performance through the construction of Co 3d&#8208;O 2p&#8208;Eu 4f unit sites on the Eu2O3&#8211;Co model is proposed. Through the gradient orbital coupling, the pristine ionic property between Eu and O atoms is assigned with increased covalency, which optimizes the eg occupancy of Co sites, and weakens the O&#63742;O bond, thus ultimately breaking the scaling relation between *OOH and *OH at Co&#8211;O&#8211;Eu unit sites. The optimized model catalyst displays onset and half&#8208;wave potential of 1.007 and 0.887&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, respectively, which are higher than those of commercial Pt/C and most Co&#8208;based catalysts ever reported. In addition, the catalyst is found to possess superior selectivity and durability. It also reveals better cell performance than commercial noble&#8208;metal catalysts in Zn&#8211;air batteries in terms of high power/energy densities and long cycle life. This study provides a new perspective for electronic modulation strategy by the construction of gradient 3d&#8211;2p&#8211;4f orbital coupling.

         <dc:description>
A CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface, which exhibits a low onset potential of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural oxidation reaction and high current density, is successfully synthesized. The analytical results show that the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface can strengthen the adsorption and activation capacity of organic molecules and OH&#8722; species, and promote the dehydrogenation and electron transfer in the process of 5&#8208;formyl&#8208;2&#8208;furancarboxylic acid&#8594;2,5&#8208;furandicarboxylic acid.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic oxidation of 5&#8208;hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) provides an efficient way to obtain high&#8208;value&#8208;added biomass&#8208;derived chemicals.&#160;Compared with other transition metal oxides, CuO exhibits poor oxygen evolution reaction performance, leading to high Faraday efficiency for HMF oxidation.&#160;However, the weak adsorption and activation ability of CuO to OH&#8722; species restricts its further development. Herein, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface is successfully constructed, resulting in an advanced onset&#8208;potential of the HMF oxidation reaction (HMFOR), a higher current density than CuO. The results of open&#8208;circuit potential, in&#160;situ infrared spectroscopy, and theoretical calculations indicate that the introduction of PdO enhances the adsorption capacity of the organic molecule.&#160;Meanwhile, the CuO&#8211;PdO heterogeneous interface promotes the adsorption and activation of OH&#8722; species, as demonstrated by zeta potential and electrochemical measurements. This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.

This work elucidates the adsorption enhancement mechanism of heterogeneous interfaces and provides constructive guidance for designing efficient multicomponent electrocatalysts in organic electrocatalytic reactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Unraveling the Mechanisms of the Apis mellifera Honeycomb Construction by 4D X&#8208;ray Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using X&#8208;ray microscopy, a millennium&#8208;old question of how bees build combs is answered. Individual cells are seen to grow out of the spine, which behaves as a substrate from which the hexagonal geometry is directly adopted. Seminal features such as the corrugated spine, coping, and porosities are observed, that further give us significant insights into the comb's construction and properties.








Abstract
Honeycomb is one of nature's best engineered structures. Even though it has inspired several modern engineering structures, an understanding of the process by which the hexagonal cells are formed in 3D space is lacking. Previous studies on the structure of the honeycomb are based on either 2D microscopy or by direct visual observations. As a result, several critical features of its microstructure and the precise mechanisms of its growth are not well understood. Using 4D X&#8208;ray microscopy, this study shows how individual and groups of honeycomb cells are formed. Cells grow additively from a corrugated central spine in a dynamic manner. The previously undocumented, corrugated spine contributes significantly to the comb's robust mechanical properties in all three dimensions. As cells grow, honey bees create a &#8220;coping,&#8221; which this study shows to be the location where new wax material is deposited behind where compaction and densification take place. This is exemplified by pores in the wax observed at the coping and alternating rear junctions between the comb cells that arise from the additive building technique and the highly efficient cell packing methodology, respectively. Additional mechanisms for growth and formation are discussed and described.

         <title>Multispectral Large&#8208;Panel X&#8208;ray Imaging Enabled by Stacked Metal Halide Scintillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An entirely new strategy to obtain multispectral large&#8208;area X&#8208;ray imaging by stacked metal halide scintillators is proposed. Dual and four&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray imaging are achieved, respectively, by two&#8208; and four&#8208;layer stacked scintillators based on a low&#8208;cost and scalable approach. Details that are not observable in conventional energy&#8208;integration X&#8208;ray imaging are clearly shown.








Abstract
Conventional energy&#8208;integration black&#8211;white X&#8208;ray imaging lacks the spectral information of X&#8208;ray photons. Although X&#8208;ray spectra (energy) can be distinguished by the photon&#8208;counting technique typically with CdZnTe detectors, it is very challenging to be applied to large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging (FPXI). Herein, multilayer stacked scintillators of different X&#8208;ray absorption capabilities and scintillation spectra are designed; in this scenario, the X&#8208;ray energy can be discriminated by detecting the emission spectra of each scintillator; therefore, multispectral X&#8208;ray imaging can be easily obtained by color or multispectral visible&#8208;light camera in a single shot of X&#8208;rays. To verify this idea, stacked multilayer scintillators based on several emerging metal halides are fabricated in a cost&#8208;effective and scalable solution process, and proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept multispectral (or multi&#8208;energy) FPXI are experimentally demonstrated. The dual&#8208;energy X&#8208;ray image of a &#8220;bone&#8211;muscle&#8221; model clearly shows the details that are invisible in conventional energy&#8208;integration FPXI. By stacking four layers of specifically designed multilayer scintillators with appropriate thicknesses, a prototype FPXI with four energy channels is realized, proving its extendibility to multispectral or even hyperspectral X&#8208;ray imaging. This study provides a facile and effective strategy to realize multispectral large&#8208;area flat&#8208;panel X&#8208;ray imaging.

         <title>Implanting CoOx Clusters on Ordered Macroporous ZnO Nanoreactors for Efficient CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoOx nanoclusters are anchored in hierarchically ordered interconnected porous N/C co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) nanoreactors for efficient CO2 photoreduction. Benefitting from the optimized chemical composition, a unique hollow scaffold with highly ordered porous channels, and exposure of abundant accessible active sites, the obtained catalyst shows a superior performance for solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion powered by visible light.








Abstract
Despite suffering from slow charge&#8208;carrier mobility, photocatalysis is still an attractive and promising technology toward producing green fuels from solar energy. An effective approach is to design and fabricate advanced architectural materials as photocatalysts to enhance the performance of semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalytic systems. Herein, metal&#8211;organic&#8208;framework&#8208;derived hierarchically ordered porous nitrogen and carbon co&#8208;doped ZnO (N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO) structures are developed as nanoreactors with decorated CoOx nanoclusters for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion driven by visible light. Introduction of hierarchical nanoarchitectures with highly ordered interconnected meso&#8211;macroporous channels shows beneficial properties for photocatalytic reduction reactions, including enhanced mobility of charge carriers throughout the highly accessible framework, maximized exposure of active sites, and inhibited recombination of photoinduced charge carriers. Density functional theory calculations further reveal the key role of CoOx nanoclusters with high affinity to CO2 molecules, and the Co&#63743;O bonds formed on the surface of the composite exhibit stronger charge redistribution. As a result, the obtained CoOx/N&#8208;C&#8208;ZnO demonstrates enhanced photocatalysis performance in terms of high CO yield and long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Potassium&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Intrinsic Defects in Porous Carbons for Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C&#8208;1100) with abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type (V12) carbon defects via direct pyrolysis of a K+&#8208;confined metal&#8211;organic framework (K+@bio&#8208;MOF&#8208;1) at 1100 &#176;C. Strikingly, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C&#8208;1100 presents excellent electrocatalytic CO2 reduction activity with ultrahigh CO Faradic efficiency up to 99% at &#8722;0.45 V, far surpassing the N&#8208;doped carbon (N&#8208;C&#8208;1100) counterpart.








Abstract
The fabrication of intrinsic carbon defects is usually tangled with doping effects, and the identification of their unique roles in catalysis remains a tough task. Herein, a K+&#8208;assisted synthetic strategy is developed to afford porous carbon (K&#8208;defect&#8208;C) with abundant intrinsic defects and complete elimination of heteroatom via direct pyrolysis of K+&#8208;confined metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). Positron&#8208;annihilation lifetime spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure measurement, and scanning transmission electron microscopy jointly illustrate the existence of abundant 12&#8208;vacancy&#8208;type carbon defects (V12) in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C. Remarkably, the K&#8208;defect&#8208;C achieves ultrahigh CO Faradaic efficiency (99%) at &#8722;0.45&#160;V in CO2 electroreduction, far surpassing MOF&#8208;derived carbon without K+ etching. Theoretical calculations reveal that the V12 defects in K&#8208;defect&#8208;C favor CO2 adsorption and significantly accelerate the formation of the rate&#8208;determining COOH* intermediate, thereby promoting CO2 reduction. This work develops a novel strategy to generate intrinsic carbon defects and provides new insights into their critical role in catalysis.

         <title>Structure/Interface Coupling Effect for High&#8208;Voltage LiCoO2 Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Co&#8208;modified LCO, which couples pillar structures with interface shielding, is successfully synthesized for achieving a high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and structurally stable cathode material. The as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6 V.








Abstract
LiCoO2 (LCO) is widely applied in today's rechargeable battery markets for consumer electronic devices. However, LCO operations at high voltage are hindered by accelerated structure degradation and electrode/electrolyte interface decomposition. To overcome these challenges, co&#8208;modified LCO (defined as CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO)&#160;that couples pillar structures with interface shielding are successfully synthesized for achieving high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and structurally stable cathode material. Benefitting from the &#8220;Mg&#8208;pillar&#8221; effect, irreversible phase transitions are significantly suppressed and highly reversible Li+ shuttling is enabled. Interestingly, bonding effects between the interfacial lattice oxygen of CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO and amorphous CoxBy coating layer are found to elevate the formation energy of oxygen vacancies, thereby considerably mitigating lattice oxygen loss and inhibiting irreversible phase transformation. Meanwhile, interface shielding effects are also beneficial for mitigating parasitic electrode/electrolyte reactions, subsequent Co dissolution, and ultimately enable a robust electrode/electrolyte interface. As a result, the as&#8208;designed CB&#8208;Mg&#8208;LCO cathode achieves a high capacity and excellent cycle stability with 94.6% capacity retention at an extremely high cut&#8208;off voltage of 4.6&#160;V. These findings provide new insights for cathode material modification methods, which serves to guide future cathode material design.

         <title>A Polymeric Strategy Empowering Vascular Cell Selectivity and Potential Application Superior to Extracellular Matrix Peptides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric strategy for designing and finding the endothelial cell&#8208;selective biomaterials is reported, which is superior to extracellular matrix derived endothelial cell&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding the cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration of endothelial cell versus smooth muscle cell and displays great potential in vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.








Abstract
Endothelialization of vascular implants plays a vital role in maintaining the long&#8208;term vascular patency. In situ endothelialization and re&#8208;endothelialization is generally achieved by selectively promoting endothelial cell (EC) adhesion and, meanwhile, suppressing smooth muscle cell (SMC) adhesion. Currently, such EC versus SMC selectivity is achieved and extensively used in vascular&#8208;related biomaterials utilizing extracellular&#8208;matrix&#8208;derived EC&#8208;selective peptides, dominantly REDV and YIGSR. Nevertheless, the application of EC&#8208;selective peptides is limited due to their easy proteolysis, time&#8208;consuming synthesis, and expensiveness. To address these limitations, a polymeric strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials using amphiphilic &#946;&#8208;peptide polymers by tuning serum protein adsorption is reported. The optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer displays EC versus SMC selectivity even superior to EC&#8208;selective REDV peptide regarding cell adhesion, proliferation, and migration of ECs versus SMCs. Study of the mechanism indicates that surface adsorption of bovine serum albumin, an abundant and anti&#8208;adhesive serum protein, plays a critical role in the ECs versus SMCs selectivity of &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer. In addition, surface modification of the optimal &#946;&#8208;peptide polymer effectively promotes the endothelialization of vascular implants and inhibits intimal hyperplasia. This study provides an alternative strategy in designing and finding EC&#8208;selective biomaterials, implying great potential in the vascular&#8208;related biomaterial study and application.

         <title>Colossal Room&#8208;Temperature Terahertz Topological Response in Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal NbIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With development of room&#8208;temperature (RT) terahertz (THz) detectors, layered materials with topological band structure have stimulated burgeoning research interest. In this work, type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal NbIrTe4&#160;is applied in RT THz detection, which, compared with other known layered materials, exhibits the highest photoresponsivity, the largest anisotropic ratio of intrinsic conductance&#160;and THz photocurrent, and excellent air stability.








Abstract
The electromagnetic spectrum between microwave and infrared light is termed the &#8220;terahertz (THz) gap,&#8221; of which there is an urgent lack of feasible and efficient room&#8208;temperature (RT) THz detectors. Type&#8208;II Weyl semimetals (WSMs) have been predicted to host significant RT topological&#160;photoresponses in low&#8208;frequency regions, especially in the THz gap, well addressing the shortcomings of THz detectors. However, such devices have&#160;not&#160;been&#160;experimentally realized yet. Herein, a type&#8208;II WSM (NbIrTe4) is selected to fabricate THz detector, which exhibits a photoresponsivity of 5.7&#160;&#215;&#160;104&#160;V&#160;W&#8722;1 and a one&#8208;year air stability at RT. Such excellent THz&#8208;detection performance can be attributed to the topological effect of type&#8208;II WSM in which the effective mass of photogenerated electrons can be reduced by the large tilting angle of Weyl nodes to further improve mobility and photoresponsivity. Impressively, this device shows a giant intrinsic anisotropic conductance (&#963;max/&#963;min&#160;=&#160;339) and THz response (Iph&#8208;max/Iph&#8208;min&#160;= 40.9), both of which are record values known. The findings open a new avenue for the realization of uncooled and highly sensitive THz detectors by exploring type&#8208;II WSM&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Observation of Coexisting Dirac Bands and Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Magic&#8208;Angle Twisted Trilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) hosts robust superconductivity with unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant behaviors. A systematic investigation combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy on MATTG revealing the coexistence of the Dirac band and the moir&#233; flat band serves as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.








Abstract
Moir&#233; superlattices that consist of two or more layers of 2D materials stacked together with a small twist angle have emerged as a tunable platform to realize various correlated and topological phases, such as Mott insulators, unconventional superconductivity, and quantum anomalous Hall effect. Recently, magic&#8208;angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) has shown both robust superconductivity similar to magic&#8208;angle twisted bilayer graphene and other unique properties, including the Pauli&#8208;limit violating and re&#8208;entrant superconductivity. These rich properties are deeply rooted in its electronic structure under the influence of distinct moir&#233; potential and mirror symmetry. Here, combining nanometer&#8208;scale spatially resolved angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy and scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the as&#8208;yet unexplored band structure of MATTG near charge neutrality is systematically measured. These measurements reveal the coexistence of the distinct dispersive Dirac band with the emergent moir&#233; flat band, showing nice agreement with the theoretical calculations. These results serve as a stepstone for further understanding of the unconventional superconductivity in MATTG.

         <title>Thermoformable Boron Nitride Based All&#8208;Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrically insulating thermoformable ceramic matrix composites, for low&#8208;profile thermal management, take advantage of phononic conducting networks to transport heat from the heat source. This advancement and new field of study outlined in this work, show significant promise to enable size reduction and effective cooling advantage over the incumbent aluminum metal heat sinks.








Abstract
Thermoforming processing, traditionally reserved for thermoplastic polymers and sheet metals, is extended here to boron&#8208;based all&#8208;ceramics. Specifically, sintered boron nitride composite sheets manufactured via a combined vibration and tape&#8208;casting photopolymerization process exhibit a highly oriented microstructure that allows these preform sheets to flow as viscous Bingham pseudoplastics during compression molding. These sintered all&#8208;ceramic preforms are thermoformed into thin, complex parts with features down to 200&#160;&#181;m. Further, a new workflow is leveraged to generate bespoke all&#8208;ceramic heat spreaders that can be press&#8208;fit onto printed circuit boards and outperform metal heat sinks as a low&#8208;profile thermal management solution. This work offers a route for other all&#8208;ceramics that may be thermoformed through first fabricating pre&#8208;forms with highly&#8208;ordered anisotropic microstructures.

         <title>A pH&#8208;Responsive Cluster Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanoparticle for Enhanced Tumor Accumulation and Antitumor Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>

A pH&#8208;responsive metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticle responsively removes hydrophilic compositions with steric hindrance and exposes the hydrophobic part in situ, forming clustering nanoparticles with enhanced tumor accumulation and therapeutic effects.








Abstract
As a result of the deficient tumor&#8208;specific antigens, potential off&#8208;target effect, and influence of protein corona, metal&#8211;organic framework nanoparticles have inadequate accumulation in tumor tissues, limiting their therapeutic effects. In this work, a pH&#8208;responsive linker (L) is prepared by covalently modifying oleylamine (OA) with 3&#8208;(bromomethyl)&#8208;4&#8208;methyl&#8208;2,5&#8208;furandione (MMfu) and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG). Then, the L is embedded into a solid lipid nanoshell to coat apilimod (Ap)&#8208;loaded zeolitic imidazolate framework (Ap&#8208;ZIF) to form Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L. Under the tumor microenvironment, the hydrophilic PEG and MMfu are removed, exposing the hydrophobic OA on Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L, increasing their uptake in cancer cells and accumulation in the tumor. The ZIF@SLN#L nanoparticle induces reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ap released from Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L significantly promotes intracellular ROS and lactate dehydrogenase generation. Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#L inhibits tumor growth, increases the survival rate in mice, activates the tumor microenvironment, and improves the infiltration of macrophages and T cells in the tumor, as demonstrated in two different tumor&#8208;bearing mice after injections with Ap&#8208;ZIF@SLN#TL. Furthermore, mice show normal tissue structure&#160;of the main organs and the normal serum level in alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase after treatment with the nanoparticles. Overall, this pH&#8208;responsive targeting strategy improves nanoparticle accumulation in tumors with enhanced therapeutic effects.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic&#8211;Ferromagnetic Heterostructure&#8208;Based Field&#8208;Free Terahertz Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A field&#8208;free spintronic THz emitter is successfully realized in an antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure, which facilitates the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect. Significantly, stronger spintronic THz radiation is generated using the coherent superposition of two heterojunctions with opposite pinning orientations.








Abstract
Recently, ferromagnetic&#8208;heterostructure spintronic terahertz (THz) emitters have been recognized as one of the most promising candidates for next&#8208;generation THz sources, owing to their peculiarities of high efficiency, high stability, low cost, ultrabroad bandwidth, controllable polarization, and high scalability. Despite the substantial efforts, they rely on external magnetic fields to initiate the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion, which hitherto greatly limits their proliferation as practical devices. Here, a unique antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20) heterostructure is innovated, and it is demonstrated that it can efficiently generate THz radiation without any external magnetic field. It is assigned to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect and enhanced anisotropy. By precisely balancing the exchange bias effect and enhanced THz radiation efficiency, an optimized 5.6 nm&#8208;thick IrMn3|Co20Fe60B20|W trilayer heterostructure is successfully realized, yielding an intensity surpassing that of Pt|Co20Fe60B20|W. Moreover, the intensity of THz emission is further boosted by togethering the trilayer sample and bilayer sample. Besides, the THz polarization may be flexibly controlled by rotating the sample azimuthal angle, manifesting sophisticated active THz field manipulation capability. The field&#8208;free coherent THz emission that is demonstrated here shines light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Phase&#8208;Transitional Bismuth&#8208;Based Metals enable Rapid Embolotherapy, Hyperthermia, and Biomedical Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional bismuth&#8208;based liquid embolic agent with rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition is proposed for administrating simultaneous embolotherapy, hyperthermia, and biomedical imaging. This high&#8208;image&#8208;contrast material is demonstrated with fast embolization of arteriovenous vessels and tumor nutrient supply vessels and enhanced treatment efficacy via combination with hyperthermia, which holds big promises in future embolism and theranostic platform.








Abstract
Embolization has been an important minimally invasive therapy for occlusion of malfunctioned vasculature and tumor treatment via target delivering embolic agents. The limitation of conventional embolic agents, such as fabrication process, precipitation time, invisibility, and lack of integrated functions often leads to insufficient embolization efficacy. To overcome these drawbacks, a multifunctional bismuth (Bi)&#8208;based liquid embolic agent for simultaneous realization of embolotherapy, thermotherapy, as well as high&#8208;contrast biomedical imaging is proposed. Benefitting from the suitable melting point, flexible nature, metallic merit, and easygoing operation via injection, the versatile embolic agent can achieve rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase transition, magnetic hyperthermia, and multimodal imaging capability. The Bi&#8208;based materials are demonstrated with excellent arteriovenous embolization efficiency and favorable biocompatibility according to in vivo investigations. Introduction of the liquid embolic agent to tumor arteries achieves evident tumor regression and rather clear imaging under computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging&#160;(MRI), and thermographs for consistently tracking the implants over the biological body. Further, the combined therapy coupled with thermotherapy exhibits improved therapeutic efficiency with formation of necrosis and total tumor eradiation at day 15&#160;after the treatment. The present innovative embolic agent and the surgical principle provide a promising modality for embolization and potential theranostic platform of tumors.

         <title>All&#8208;Polymer Bulk&#8208;Heterojunction Organic Electrochemical Transistors with Balanced Ionic and Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;polymer bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with good ambipolar property is achieved through the blending of a new p&#8208;type ladder polymer and a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art n&#8208;type ladder polymer. The concept of the BHJ provides a facile strategy to develop ambipolar OECTs with balanced electron and hole transport, and ultimately to achieve high amplification and easy scaling for integrated circuits.








Abstract
The rapid development of organic electrochemical transistor (OECTs)&#8208;based circuits brings new opportunities for next&#8208;generation integrated bioelectronics.

&lt;p&gt;An all-polymer bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with good ambipolar property is achieved through the blending of a new p-type ladder polymer and a state-of-the-art n-type ladder polymer. The concept of the BHJ provides a facile strategy to develop ambipolar OECTs with balanced electron and hole transport, and ultimately to achieve high amplification and easy scaling for integrated circuits.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Establishing Self&#8208;Dopant Design Principles from Structure&#8211;Function Relationships in Self&#8208;n&#8208;Doped Perylene Diimide Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A circumscribed set of design principles that relate structure to material observables is analyzed to disentangle the effects of how counterion, tether length, and steric encumbrance affect doping levels, thermal activation, and stability of self&#8208;doped organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Self&#8208;doping is a particular doping method that has been applied to a wide range of organic semiconductors. However, there is a lack of understanding regarding the relationship between dopant structure and function. A structurally diverse series of self&#8208;n&#8208;doped perylene diimides (PDIs) is investigated to study the impact of steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and dopant/PDI tether distance on functional parameters such as doping, stability, morphology, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility. The studies show that self&#8208;n&#8208;doping is best enabled by the use of sterically encumbered ammoniums with short tethers and Lewis basic counterions. Additionally, water is found to inhibit doping, which concludes that thermal degradation is merely a phenomenological feature of certain dopants, and that residual solvent evaporation is the primary driver of thermally activated doping. In situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering studies show that sample annealing increases the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance and shrinks grain boundaries for improved long&#8208;range ordering. These features are then correlated to contactless carrier&#8208;mobility measurements with time&#8208;resolved microwave conductivity before and after thermal annealing. The collective relationships between structural features and functionality are finally used to establish explicit self&#8208;n&#8208;dopant design principles for the future design of materials with improved functionality.

         <title>Antiferromagnetic Inverse Spin Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. ISHE signals dependent on the N&#233;el vector in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] are observed, and they are much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The finding enriches the Hall effect family, and makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.








Abstract
The inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE) is one of the accessible and reliable methods to detect spin current. The magnetization&#8208;dependent inverse spin Hall effect has been observed in magnets, expanding the dimension for spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. However, antiferromagnetic N&#233;el&#8208;vector&#8208;dependent ISHE, which has been long time highly pursued, is still elusive. Here, ISHE in Mn2Au/[Co/Pd] heterostructures is investigated by terahertz emission and spin Seebeck effect measurements, where [Co/Pd] possesses perpendicular magnetic anisotropy for out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarized spin current generation and Mn2Au is a collinear antiferromagnet for the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization (&#963;z) is rotated toward in&#8208;plane by the N&#233;el vectors in Mn2Au, then the spin current is converted into charge current at two staggered spin sublattices. The ISHE signal is much stronger when the converted charge current is parallel to the N&#233;el vector compared with its orthogonal counterpart. The N&#233;el vector and resultant ISHE signals, which is termed as antiferromagnetic inverse spin Hall effect, can be switched. The finding not only adds a new member to the Hall effect family, but also makes antiferromagnetic spintronics more flexible.

         <title>Step&#8208;Climbing Epitaxy of Layered Materials with Giant Out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Lattice Mismatch</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy is proposed, in which epilayers grow across the stepped surfaces and form continuous films. Based on the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy, wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se films with controllable thickness can be obtained. One&#8208;unit&#8208;cell films exhibit a high room&#8208;temperature Hall mobility of 180 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness.








Abstract
Heteroepitaxy with large lattice mismatch remains a great challenge for high&#8208;quality epifilm growth. Although great efforts have been devoted to epifilm growth with an in&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, the epitaxy of 2D layered crystals on stepped substrates with a giant out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is seldom reported. Here, taking the molecular&#8208;beam epitaxy of 2D semiconducting Bi2O2Se on 3D SrTiO3 substrates as an example, a step&#8208;climbing epitaxy growth strategy is proposed, in which the n&#8208;th (n&#160;= 1, 2, 3&#8230;) epilayer climbs the step with height difference from out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch and continues to grow the n+1&#8208;th epilayer. Step&#8208;climbing epitaxy can spontaneously relax and release the strain from the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch, which ensures the high quality of large&#8208;area epitaxial films. Wafer&#8208;scale uniform 2D Bi2O2Se single&#8208;crystal films with controllable thickness can be obtained via step&#8208;climbing epitaxy. Most notably, one&#8208;unit&#8208;cell Bi2O2Se films (1.2&#160;nm thick) exhibit a high Hall mobility of 180 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 at room temperature, which exceeds that of silicon and other 2D semiconductors with comparable thickness. As an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice mismatch is generally present in the epitaxy of layered materials, the step&#8208;climbing epitaxy strategy expands the existing epitaxial growth theory and provides guidance toward the high&#8208;quality synthesis of layered materials.

         <title>3D Printing Nanostructured Solid Polymer Electrolytes with High Modulus and Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanostructured solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) were 3D printed using a visible light photopolymerization induced microphase separation approach. By forming two chemically independent nanodomains, SPEs with high conductivity (up to 3 &#215; 10&#8208;4 S cm&#8208;1) and high elastic modulus (G&#8242; &gt; 108 Pa) were obtained. The SPEs were 3D printed into complex architectures and readily applied as functional supercapacitor electrolytes.








Abstract
The development of advanced solid&#8208;state energy&#8208;storage devices is contingent upon finding new ways to produce and manufacture scalable, high&#8208;modulus solid&#8208;state electrolytes that can simultaneously provide high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical integrity.

&lt;p&gt;Nanostructured solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) were 3D printed using a visible light photopolymerization induced microphase separation approach. By forming two chemically independent nanodomains, SPEs with high conductivity (up to 3 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; S cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) and high elastic modulus (G&#8242; &amp;gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Pa) were obtained. The SPEs were 3D printed into complex architectures and readily applied as functional supercapacitor electrolytes.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The development of advanced solid-state energy-storage devices is contingent upon finding new ways to produce and manufacture scalable, high-modulus solid-state electrolytes that can simultaneously provide high ionic conductivity and robust mechanical integrity. In this work, an efficient one-step process to manufacture solid polymer electrolytes composed of nanoscale ion-conducting channels embedded in a rigid crosslinked polymer matrix via Digital Light Processing 3D printing&#160;is reported. A visible-light-mediated polymerization-induced microphase-separation approach is utilized, which produces materials with two chemically independent nanoscale domains with highly tunable nanoarchitectures.

         <title>Effect of Magnetic Impurities on Superconductivity in LaH10</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anderson's theorem states that nonmagnetic impurities do not affect the isotropic order parameter in Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) superconductors, whereas scattering on paramagnetic centers is very efficient in destroying the s&#8208;wave superconductivity. This work&#160;demonstrates that LaH10, the best so far known superconductor, obeys Anderson's theorem, which makes it possible to adjust its critical temperature for a specific application.








Abstract
Polyhydrides are a novel class of superconducting materials with extremely high critical parameters, which is very promising for sensor applications. On the other hand, a complete experimental study of the best so far known superconductor, lanthanum superhydride LaH10, encounters a serious complication because of the large upper critical magnetic field HC2(0), exceeding 120&#8211;160&#160;T. It is found that partial replacement of La atoms by magnetic Nd atoms results in significant suppression of superconductivity in LaH10: each at% of Nd causes a decrease in TC by 10&#8211;11&#160;K, helping to control the critical parameters of this compound. Strong pulsed magnetic fields up to 68&#160;T are used to study the Hall effect, magnetoresistance, and the magnetic phase diagram of ternary metal polyhydrides for the first time. Surprisingly, (La,Nd)H10 demonstrates completely linear HC2(T)&#160;&#8733;&#160;|T &#8211;&#160;TC|, which calls into question the applicability of the Werthamer&#8211;Helfand&#8211;Hohenberg model for polyhydrides. The suppression of superconductivity in LaH10 by magnetic Nd atoms and the robustness of TC with respect to nonmagnetic impurities (e.g., Y, Al, C) under Anderson's theorem gives new experimental evidence of the isotropic (s&#8208;wave) character of conventional electron&#8211;phonon pairing in lanthanum decahydride.

Organic Semiconductors
Self&#8208;doping is an essential method of increasing carrier concentrations in organic electronics that eliminates the need to tailor host&#8211;dopant miscibility, a necessary step when employing extrinsic molecular dopants. In article number 2204656, Daniel Powell, Luisa Whittaker&#8208;Brooks, and co&#8208;workers investigate a series of self&#8208;doped organic semiconductors to generate fundamental guidelines for determining the impact that steric encumbrance, counterion selection, and tether distances has on doping efficiency, stability, morphology, and charge&#8208;carrier mobility.

Terahertz Emitters
In article number 2204373, Xiaojun Wu, Caihua Wan, Jimin Zhao, Sai Chen, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate efficient terahertz generation from a unique antiferromagnetic&#8211;ferromagnetic (IrMn3|CoFeB) heterostructure without an external magnetic field, using femtosecond laser pulse excitation. This can be attributed to the exchange bias or interfacial exchange coupling effect. Such field&#8208;free THz spintronics emitters can be more easily integrated with optical devices, shining light on the development of spintronic THz optoelectronic devices.

Embolic Agents
In article number 2205002, Xuyang Sun, Jing Liu, and co&#8208;workers propose a novel liquid embolic agent with rapid liquid&#8211;solid phase&#8208;transition capability, for administrating simultaneous embolotherapy, hyperthermia, and biomedical imaging. Through simple syringe injection, the liquid embolic agent can flow and fill the nutrient supply vessels of the hepatoma to realize fast embolization. This high&#8208;image&#8208;contrast material with good biocompatibility is also demonstrated to produce a large amount of heat under an external electromagnetic field to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of tumor embolization, which holds great promise in future embolism and theranostic platforms.

         <title>Greenificated Molecularly Imprinted Materials for Advanced Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 42, October 20, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs), possessing the potential to meet all current &#8220;sustainability&#8221; requirements, are being intensively developed to solve the key issues related to revolutionary technologies. Herein, a comprehensive review of the advanced applications of GMIPs in fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields is summarized, involving &#8220;GREENIFICATION&#8221; principles, preparation strategies, GMIPs&#8217; features, obscure technical challenges, critical thoughts, and prospective trends.








Abstract
Molecular imprinting technology (MIT) produces artificial binding sites with precise complementarity to substrates and thereby is capable of exquisite molecular recognition. Over five decades of evolution, it is predicted that the resulting host imprinted materials will overtake natural receptors for research and application purposes, but in practice, this has not yet been realized due to the unsustainability of their life cycles (i.e., precursors, creation, use, recycling, and end&#8208;of&#8208;life). To address this issue, greenificated molecularly imprinted polymers (GMIPs) are a new class of plastic antibodies that have approached sustainability by following one or more of the greenification principles, while also demonstrating more far&#8208;reaching applications compared to their natural counterparts. In this review, the most recent developments in the delicate design and advanced application of GMIPs in six fast&#8208;growing and emerging fields are surveyed, namely biomedicine/therapy, catalysis, energy harvesting/storage, nanoparticle detection, gas sensing/adsorption, and environmental remediation. In addition, their distinct features are highlighted, and the optimal means to utilize these features for attaining incredibly far&#8208;reaching applications are discussed. Importantly, the obscure technical challenges of the greenificated MIT are revealed, and conceivable solutions are offered. Lastly, several perspectives on future research directions are proposed.

         <dc:description>
The predicting process of immunotherapy utilizing imaging technology holds huge promise in boosting the response rate of clinical patients. Here, the latest progress in imaging&#8208;guided nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials for real&#8208;time monitoring of immune cells and immune signaling molecules is summarized to predict the efficacy of immunotherapy, and future directions and main challenges for the visualization of response rates are also discussed.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical modalities for the treatment of malignant tumors and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings. However, it continues to face several challenges, including long treatment cycles, high costs, immune&#8208;related adverse events, and low response rates. Thus, it is critical to predict the response rate to immunotherapy by using imaging technology in the preoperative and intraoperative. Here, the latest advances in nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials used for predicting responses to immunotherapy via the imaging of immune cells and signaling molecules in the immune microenvironment are comprehensively summarized. Several imaging methods, such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, used in immune predictive imaging, are discussed to show the potential of nanosystems for distinguishing immunotherapy responders from nonresponders. Nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials aided by various imaging technologies are expected to enable the effective prediction and diagnosis in cases of tumors, inflammation, and other public diseases.

         <title>Single&#8208;Crystal Perovskite Solar Cells Exhibit Close to Half A Millimeter Electron&#8208;Diffusion Length</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 20 to 300&#160;&#181;m can still exhibit efficient charge collection in the absence of an external voltage bias, resulting in high power conversion efficiency. The electron&#8208;diffusion length in these crystals is calculated to be longer than 0.4&#160;mm. This work demonstrates that perovskite crystals can offer more than what is currently expected.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal halide perovskites exhibit photogenerated&#8208;carriers of high mobility and long lifetime, making them excellent candidates for applications demanding thick semiconductors, such as ionizing radiation detectors, nuclear batteries, and concentrated photovoltaics. However, charge collection depreciates with increasing thickness; therefore, tens to hundreds of volts of external bias is required to extract charges from a thick perovskite layer, leading to a considerable amount of dark current and fast degradation of perovskite absorbers. However, extending the carrier&#8208;diffusion length can mitigate many of the anticipated issues preventing the practical utilization of perovskites in the abovementioned applications. Here, single&#8208;crystal perovskite solar cells that are up to 400 times thicker than state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite polycrystalline films are fabricated, yet retain high charge&#8208;collection efficiency in the absence of an external bias. Cells with thicknesses of 110, 214, and 290&#160;&#181;m display power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 20.0, 18.4, and 14.7%, respectively. The remarkable persistence of high PCEs, despite the increase in thickness, is a result of a long electron&#8208;diffusion length in those cells, which was&#160;estimated, from the thickness&#8208;dependent short&#8208;circuit current, to be &#8776;0.45&#160;mm under 1 sun illumination. These results pave the way for adapting perovskite devices to optoelectronic applications in which a thick active layer is essential.

         <title>Over 200 &#176;C Broad&#8208;Temperature Lasers Reconstructed from a Blue&#8208;Phase Polymer Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A broad lasing temperature range of 25&#8211;230 &#176;C reconstructed from a blue&#8208;phase polymer scaffold is presented. In addition, the corresponding mechanistic analysis for the wide lasing temperature range is also investigated, i.e., a matched reflection and fluorescence spectra, a robust BP structure, a persistent life time of dye, etc.








Abstract
Blue&#8208;phase liquid crystal (BPLC) lasers have received extensive attention and have potential applications in sensors, displays, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting, owing to their unique 3D photonic bandgap. However, the working temperature range of such BPLC lasers is insufficient, and investigations are required to elucidate the underlying mechanism. Herein, a broad&#8208;temperature reconstructed laser is successfully achieved in dye&#8208;doped polymer&#8208;stabilized blue&#8208;phase liquid crystals (DD&#8208;PSBPLCs) with an unprecedented working temperature range of 25&#8211;230 &#176;C based on a robust polymer scaffold, which combines the thermal stability and the tunability from the system. The broad&#8208;temperature lasing stems from the high thermal stability of the robust polymerized system used, which affords enough reflected and matched fluorescence signals. The temperature&#8208;tunable lasing behavior of the DD&#8208;PSBPLCs is associated with the phase transition of the unpolymerized content (&#8776;60 wt%) in the system, which endows with a reconstructed characteristic of BP lasers including a U&#8208;shaped lasing threshold, a reversible lasing wavelength, and an obvious lasing enhancement at about 70 &#176;C. This work not only provides a new idea for the design of broad&#8208;temperature BPLC lasers, but also sets out important insight in innovative microstructure changes for novel multifunctional organic optic devices.

         <title>Direct Presentation of Tumor&#8208;Associated Antigens to Induce Adaptive Immunity by Personalized Dendritic Cell&#8208;Mimicking Nanovaccines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A personalized dendritic cells (DCs)&#8208;mimicking nanovaccine (nanoDC) is reported to initiate tumor antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T cells in lymph nodes. The nanoDCs inherit the advantages of DCs vaccines and overcome potential shortcomings of live cell&#8208;based therapy, such as insufficient immunogenicity and insufficient lymph node delivery. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, nanoDCs vaccination effectively inhibits B16&#8208;OVA and CT26 tumor growth and metastasis formation.








Abstract
Dendritic cells (DCs)&#8208;based vaccines are an approved method for inducing potent antigen&#8208;specific immune responses to eliminate tumor cells. However, this promising strategy still faces challenges such as tumor&#8208;associated antigens (TAAs) loading, lymph node homing, quality&#160;control, and other limitations. Here, a personalized DC&#8208;mimicking nanovaccine (nanoDC) for stimulation of TAAs&#8208;specific T cell populations is developed. The nanoDCs are fabricated using nanoparticles with dendritic structure and membranes from mature bone&#8208;marrow&#8208;derived cells (BMDCs). Mature BMDCs are stimulated by nanostructures assembled from Escherichia coli and tumor cells to efficiently deliver TAAs and induce BMDCs maturation through the stimulator of interferon genes (STING) pathway. By maintaining co&#8208;stimulatory markers, molecules class I (MHC&#8208;I) antigen complexes and lymphocyte homing receptors, nanoDCs efficiently migrate to lymph nodes and generate potent antigen&#8208;specific T cell responses. Consequently, vaccination with nanoDCs strongly inhibits the tumor growth and metastases formation in vivo. In particular, nanoDCs can also induce memory T cells for long&#8208;term protective immunity. This study demonstrates that nanoDCs can trigger adaptive immune protection against tumors for personalized immunotherapy and precision medicine.

         <title>Tuning the Dynamics of Viral&#8208;Factories&#8208;Inspired Compartments Formed by Peptide&#8211;RNA Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Peptide&#8211;RNA liquid compartments that are formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS) and inspired by viral factories are presented. The compartments have tunable dynamics that are regulated by light, achieved by the incorporation of a photocleavable side&#8208;chain&#8208;protecting group to the peptide building block. This system allows controlled encapsulation and light&#8208;induced release of payloads from liquid compartments.








Abstract
Viral factories are intracellular microcompartments formed by mammalian viruses in their host cells, and contain necessary machinery for viral genome replication, capsid assembly, and maturation, thus serving as &#8220;factories&#8221; for formation of new viral particles. Recent evidence suggests that these compartments are formed by liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation (LLPS)&#160;of viral proteins and nucleic acids and present dynamic properties. In this work, inspired by the remarkable functionalities of viral factories, dynamic compartments that are formed by complexation between a minimalistic, disordered peptide and RNA are designed. By systematic studies using sequence variants it is shown that the material properties of the compartments can be modulated by changes to the peptide sequence, at the single amino acid level. Moreover, by taking this approach to the next step, liquid compartments with light&#8208;induced tunable dynamics are developed. The results demonstrate that the material properties of liquid droplets can be temporally regulated by increasing peptide polarity and charge, and that these changes can be further utilized for controlled partitioning and release of payloads from the compartments.

         <title>Chemotherapy Mediated by Biomimetic Polymeric Nanoparticles Potentiates Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy via Amplification of Endoplasmic Reticulum Stress and Mitochondrial Dysfunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Redox&#8208;responsive polymeric nanoparticles (NPs) co&#8208;loaded with phosphorus dendrimer&#8211;copper(II) complexes and toyocamycin and camouflaged with cancer cell membranes are developed. The NPs can be dissociated in the tumor microenvironment to release drugs for efficient tumor chemotherapy through mitochondrial dysfunction and endoplasmic reticulum stress aggravation, which significantly potentiates tumor immunotherapy after combination with programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody to effectively inhibit tumor recurrence and metastasis.








Abstract
Construction of multifunctional nanoplatforms to elevate chemotherapeutic efficacy and induce long&#8208;term antitumor immunity still remains to be an extreme challenge. Herein, the design of an advanced redox&#8208;responsive nanomedicine formulation based on phosphorus dendrimer&#8211;copper(II) complexes (1G3&#8208;Cu)&#8208; and toyocamycin (Toy)&#8208;loaded polymeric nanoparticles (GCT NPs) coated with cancer cell membranes (CM) are reported. The designed GCT@CM NPs with a size of 210 nm are stable under physiological conditions but are rapidly dissociated in the reductive tumor microenvironment to deplete glutathione and release drugs. The co&#8208;loading of 1G3&#8208;Cu and Toy within the NPs causes significant tumor cell apoptosis and immunogenic cell death through 1G3&#8208;Cu&#8208;induced mitochondrial dysfunction and Toy&#8208;mediated amplification of endoplasmic reticulum stress, respectively, thus effectively suppressing tumor growth, promoting dendritic cell maturation, and increasing tumor&#8208;infiltrating cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Likewise, the coated CM and the loaded 1G3&#8208;Cu render the GCT@CM NPs with homotypic targeting and T1&#8208;weighted magnetic resonance imaging of tumors, respectively. With the assistance of programmed cell death ligand 1 antibody, the GCT@CM NP&#8208;mediated chemotherapy can significantly potentiate tumor immunotherapy for effective inhibition of tumor recurrence and metastasis. The developed GCT@CM NPs hold a great potential for chemotherapy&#8208;potentiated immunotherapy of different tumor types through different mechanisms or synergies.

         <title>Spintronic Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Field&#8208;Free Spin&#8211;Orbit&#8208;Torque Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly reliable spintronic physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are demonstrated by exploiting field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures. The stochastic switching polarity of the top CoFeB is achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.








Abstract
Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid&#8208;state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software&#8208;based approaches. While silicon&#8208; and memristor&#8208;based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field&#8208;free spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit&#8208;error&#8208;rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy&#8208;efficient device implementations.

The spintronic PUF is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, digital output, a zero bit-error-rate under repetitive operations, and robustness against magnetic tempering.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Physical unclonable function&#160;(PUFs) utilize inherent random physical variations of solid-state devices and are a core ingredient of hardware security primitives. PUFs promise more robust information security than that provided by the conventional software-based approaches. While silicon- and memristor-based PUFs are advancing, their reliability and scalability require further improvements. These are currently limited by output fluctuations and associated additional peripherals. Here, highly reliable spintronic PUFs that exploit field-free spin&#8211;orbit-torque switching in IrMn/CoFeB/Ta/CoFeB structures are demonstrated. It is shown that the stochastic switching polarity of the perpendicular magnetization of the top CoFeB can be achieved by manipulating the exchange bias directions of the bottom IrMn/CoFeB. This serves as an entropy source for the spintronic PUF, which is characterized by high entropy, uniqueness, reconfigurability, and digital output. Furthermore, the device ensures a zero bit-error-rate under repetitive operations and robustness against external magnetic fields, and offers scalable and energy-efficient device implementations.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Etching Bulk Covalent Organic Frameworks into Nanoparticles of Uniform and Controllable Size by the Molecular Exchange Etching Method for Sonodynamic and Immune Combination Antitumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new preparation strategy for nanoscale covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is reported, and this strategy only needs to slightly extend the commonly used COF preparation process to prepare COF nanoparticles, which is suitable for different types of imine COFs. The nanoscale COF sonosensitizer is applied for enhanced sonodynamic therapy and immunotherapy.








Abstract
To improve the therapeutic effect of sonodynamic therapy (SDT), more effective and stable sonosensitizers and therapeutic strategies are still required. A covalent organic framework (COF) sonosensitizer is developed by using a new nanoscale COF preparation strategy. This strategy uses molecular etching based on the imine exchange reaction to etch the bulk COF into nanoparticles and has universal applicability to imine&#8208;bond&#8208;based COF. The regular COF structure can prevent the loss of sonodynamic performance caused by the aggregation of porphyrin molecules and improve the chemical stability of the porphyrin unit. In addition, the coordination of Fe3+ to COF endows the nanoparticle with chemodynamic therapy performance and glutathione consumption ability. The combination of enhanced SDT and &#945;&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody achieves a good antitumor effect. The innovative nanoscale COF sonosensitizer preparation strategy provides a new avenue for clinical antitumor therapy.

         <title>Understanding H2 Evolution Electrochemistry to Minimize Solvated Water Impact on Zinc&#8208;Anode Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and using glycine additive to reduce solvated water, and it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode.








Abstract
H2 evolution is the reason for poor reversibility and limited cycle stability with Zn&#8208;metal anodes, and impedes practical application in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Here, using a combined gas chromatography experiment and computation, it is demonstrated that H2 evolution primarily originates from solvated water, rather than free water without interaction with Zn2+. Using linear sweep voltammetry (LSV) in salt electrolytes, H2 evolution is evidenced to occur at a more negative potential than zinc reduction because of the high overpotential against H2 evolution on Zn metal. The hypothesis is tested and, using a glycine additive to reduce solvated water, it is confirmed that H2 evolution and &#8220;parasitic&#8221; side reactions are suppressed on the Zn anode. This electrolyte additive is evidenced to suppress H2 evolution, reduce corrosion, and give a uniform Zn deposition in Zn|Zn and Zn|Cu cells. It is demonstrated that Zn|PANI (highly conductive polyaniline) full cells exhibit boosted electrochemical performance in 1&#160;M ZnSO4&#8211;3&#160;M glycine electrolyte. It is concluded that this new understanding of electrochemistry of H2 evolution can be used for design of relatively low&#8208;cost and safe AZIBs for practical large&#8208;scale energy storage.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Migration Mechanism: An Overall Understanding of Anionic Redox Activity in Metal Oxide Cathodes of Li/Na&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;migration mechanism is proposed to explain the different anionic redox reaction (ARR) behaviors between Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2. The theoretical and experimental results indicate that ARR activation is closely related to the migration of substitution metal from the transition metal (TM) layer to the alkali metal layer in a kinetic aspect, and vacancies in the TM layers play a vital role to activate the ARR activities.








Abstract
The anionic redox reaction (ARR) has attracted extensive attention due to its potential to enhance the reversible capacity of cathode materials in Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs/SIBs). However, the understanding of its activation mechanism is still limited by the insufficient mastering of the underlying thermodynamics and kinetics. Herein, a series of Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2 cathode materials are designed to investigate their ARR behaviors. It is found that the ARR can be activated in only Li&#8208;substituted LixMnO2 and not for Mg&#8208; and Zn&#8208;substituted ones, while all Mg/Li/Zn&#8208;substituted NaxMnO2 cathode materials exhibit ARR activities. Combining theoretical calculations with experimental results, such a huge difference between Li and Na cathodes is closely related to the migration of substitution ions from the transition metal layer to the alkali metal layer in a kinetic aspect, which generates unique Li(Na)&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;TM and/or &#9633;Li/Na&#8211;O&#8211;&#9633;TM configurations and reducing reaction activation energy to trigger the ARR. Based on these findings, an ion&#8208;migration mechanism is proposed to explain the different ARR behaviors between the NaxMnO2 and LixMnO2, which can not only reveal the origin of ARR in the kinetic aspect, but also provide a new insight for the development of high&#8208;capacity metal oxide cathode materials for LIBs/SIBs.

         <title>Interspace and Vacancy Modulation: Promoting the Zinc Storage of an Alcohol&#8208;Based Organic&#8211;Inorganic Cathode in a Water&#8211;Organic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8722;xPO4&#183;0.56C6H14O4, with enriched oxygen defects and tunable d&#8208;interspace, is designed and used as a model platform to systematically elucidate the correlation of some physicochemical properties. Coordination between the water&#8211;organic electrolyte and molecular engineering, an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile, high capacity, and long&#8208;life are achieved for Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Expanding interspace and introducing vacancies are desired to promote the mobility of Zn ions and unlock the inactive sites of layered cathodes. However, this two&#8208;point modulation has not yet been achieved simultaneously in vanadium phosphate. Here, a strategy is proposed for fabricating an alcohol&#8208;based organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material, VO1&#8722;xPO4&#183;0.56C6H14O4, to realize the conjoint modulation of the d&#8208;interspace and oxygen vacancies. Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V5+ to V4+ and the intensity of the P&#63743;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realize high chemical reactivity and redox&#8208;center optimization, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using a water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an ultrahigh&#8208;rate profile deliver a long&#8208;term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8776;142&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most of the recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This work proves the feasibility to realize the two&#8208;point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high&#8208;performance new 2D materials.

Peculiar triglycol molecules with an inclined orientation in the interlayer also boost the improvement in the conversion rate of V&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; to V&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and the intensity of the P&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;O bond. Their synergism can ensure steerable adjustment for intercalation kinetics and electron transport, as well as realize high chemical reactivity and redox-center optimization, leading to at least 200% increase in capacity. Using a water&#8211;organic electrolyte, the designed Zn-ion batteries with an ultrahigh-rate profile deliver a long-term durability (fivefold greater than pristine material) and an excellent energy density of &#8776;142&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (including masses of cathode and anode), thereby substantially outstripping most of the recently reported state-of-the-art zinc-ion batteries. This work proves the feasibility to realize the two-point modulation by using organic intercalants for exploiting high-performance new 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioactive Iridium Nanoclusters with Glutathione Depletion Ability for Enhanced Sonodynamic&#8208;Triggered Ferroptosis&#8208;Like Cancer Cell Death</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioactive HCIr nanocluster is reported for triggering effective ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death via triggering GPX4 inhibition and concurrent dual sonodynamic effect by iridium oxide nanoclusters and chlorin e6 (Ce6). These HCIr nanoclusters hold a great promise as a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent for treating intrinsic apoptotic resistance of tumors, and the findings provide a promising strategy for future studies exploring nanoclusters as anticancer agents.








Abstract
Ferroptosis is a regulated form of necrotic cell death that involves the accumulation of lipid peroxide (LPO) species in an iron&#8208; and reactive oxygen species (ROS)&#8208;dependent manner. Previous investigations have reported&#160;that ferroptosis&#8208;based cancer therapy can overcome the limitations of traditional therapeutics targeting the apoptosis pathway. However, it is still challenging to enhance the antitumor efficacy of ferroptosis due to intrinsic cellular regulation. In this study, a ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent, i.e., chlorin e6 (Ce6)&#8208;conjugated human serum albumin&#8211;iridium oxide (HSA&#8208;Ce6&#8208;IrO2, HCIr) nanoclusters, is developed to achieve sonodynamic therapy (SDT)&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. The sonosensitizing role of both Ce6 and IrO2 within the HCIr nanoclusters exhibits highly efficient 1O2 generation capacity upon ultrasound&#160;stimulation, which promotes the accumulation of LPO and subsequently induces ferroptosis. Meanwhile, the HCIr can deplete glutathione (GSH) by accelerating Ir (IV)&#8211;Ir (III) transition, which further suppresses the activity of glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) to enhance the ferroptosis efficacy. Through in vitro and in vivo experiments, it is demonstrated that HCIr possesses tremendous capacity to reduce the intracellular GSH content, which enhances SDT&#8208;triggered ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death. Thus, an iridium&#8208;nanoclusters&#8208;based ferroptosis&#8208;inducing agent is developed, providing a promising strategy for inducing ferroptosis&#8208;like cancer cell death.

         <title>A Time&#8208;Division Position&#8208;Sensitive Detector Image System for High&#8208;Speed Multitarget Trajectory Tracking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking system is designed by using a time&#8208;division position&#8208;sensitive detector system based on the lateral photovoltaic effect. There is no trade&#8208;off between framerate and resolution and the output framerate up to 62&#160;000 fps at a 0.84&#160;&#181;m spatial resolution. Moreover, frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing is demonstrated. Multichannel tracking enables object category identification, and image&#8208;distortion correction enhances the versatility in complicated environments.








Abstract
High&#8208;speed trajectory tracking with real&#8208;time processing capability is particularly important in the fields of pilotless automobiles, guidance systems, robotics, and filmmaking. The conventional optical approach to high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking involves charge coupled device (CCD) or complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor&#160;(CMOS) image sensors, which suffer from trade&#8208;offs between resolution and framerates, complexity of the system, and enormous data&#8208;analysis processes. Here, a high&#8208;speed trajectory tracking system is designed by using a time&#8208;division position&#8208;sensitive detector (TD&#8208;PSD) based on a graphene&#8211;silicon Schottky heterojunction. Benefiting from the high&#8208;speed optoelectronic response and sub&#8208;micrometer positional accuracy of the TD&#8208;PSD, multitarget real&#8208;time trajectory tracking is realized, with a maximum image output framerate of up to 62&#160;000 frames&#160;per second. Moreover, multichannel trajectory tracking and image&#8208;distortion correction functionalities are realized by TD&#8208;PSD systems through frequency&#8208;related image preprocessing, which significantly improves the capacity of real&#8208;time information processing and image quality in complicated light environments.

         <title>A Universal Chemotactic Targeted Delivery Strategy for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial chemotaxis system that shows positive chemotaxis to high concentration of inducible nitric oxide synthase and reactive oxygen species is proposed, which can precisely target inflammatory sites in vivo. Such a universal chemotactic delivery strategy aimed at the inflammatory microenvironment, can possibly avoid the problem of individual differences in the targeting strategies based on ligand&#8208;receptor specific binding.








Abstract
Above 50% of deaths can be attributed to chronic inflammatory diseases; thus, the construction of drug delivery systems based on effective interaction of inflammatory factors with chemotactic nanoparticles is meaningful. Herein, a zwitterion&#8208;based artificial chemotactic nanomotor is proposed for universal precise targeting strategy in vivo, where the high level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in inflammatory sites are used as a chemoattractant. Multidimensional static models, dynamic models, and in vivo models are established to evaluate chemotactic performance. The results show that the upregulated ROS and iNOS can induce the chemotaxis of nanomotors to diseased tissues in inflammation&#8208;related disease models. Further, mesoscale hydrodynamics simulations are performed to explain the chemotactic behavior of the nanomotors. Such a chemotactic delivery strategy is expected to improve delivery efficiency and may be applicable to a variety of inflammatory diseases.

         <title>Why it is Unfortunate that Linear Machine Learning &#8220;Works&#8221; so well in Electromechanical Switching of Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning has been lauded for its applications in materials science. The democratization has created concern about their misappropriation. In this work, it is shown how linear, nonordinal models can provide an illusion of learning details of electromechanical switching in ferroelectrics. A non&#8208;linear, ordinal deep&#8208;learning method is developed, overcoming some of the shortcomings of more simplistic models.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML)&#160;is relied on for materials spectroscopy. It is challenging to make ML models fail because statistical correlations can mimic the physics without causality. Here, using a benchmark band&#8208;excitation piezoresponse force microscopy polarization spectroscopy (BEPS) dataset the pitfalls of the so&#8208;called &#8220;better&#8221;, &#8220;faster&#8221;, and &#8220;less&#8208;biased&#8221; ML of electromechanical switching are demonstrated and overcome. Using a toy and real experimental dataset, it is demonstrated how linear nontemporal ML methods result in physically reasonable embedding (eigenvalues) while producing nonsensical eigenvectors and generated spectra, promoting misleading interpretations. A new method of unsupervised multimodal hyperspectral analysis of BEPS is demonstrated using long&#8208;short&#8208;term memory (LSTM) &#946;&#8208;variational autoencoders (&#946;&#8208;VAEs) . By including LSTM neurons, the ordinal nature of ferroelectric switching is considered. To improve the interpretability of the latent space, a variational Kullback&#8211;Leibler&#8208;divergency regularization is imposed . Finally, regularization scheduling of &#946; as a disentanglement metric is leveraged to reduce user bias. Combining these experiment&#8208;inspired modifications enables the automated detection of ferroelectric switching mechanisms, including a complex two&#8208;step, three&#8208;state one. Ultimately, this work provides a robust ML method for the rapid discovery of electromechanical switching mechanisms in ferroelectrics and is applicable to other multimodal hyperspectral materials spectroscopies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency multivalent metal plating/stripping is realized by confining Zn/Al&#8208;metal into a biomimetic scaffold through the synergy of a fractal copper array and a CaTiO3&#8208;based coating layer. The as&#8208;developed composite anodes exhibit dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, and excellent performance in multivalent metal full cells.

Rechargeable multivalent metal (e.g., zinc (Zn) and aluminum (Al)) batteries are ideal choices for large&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their intrinsic low cost and safety. However, the poor compatibility between metallic anodes and electrolytes strongly hampers their practical applications. Herein, it is demonstrated that confining multivalent metals in a biomimetic scaffold (Bio&#8208;scaffold) can achieve highly efficient multivalent metal plating/stripping. This Bio&#8208;scaffold is well&#8208;tailored through the synergy of a parallel&#8208;aligned array of fractal copper branches and a CaTiO3 (CTO)&#8208;based coating layer. By virtue of this design strategy, the as&#8208;developed Bio&#8208;scaffold&#8208;based Zn&#8208; and Al&#8208;metal anodes exhibited dendrite&#8208;free morphologies with high reversibility and long lifespan, as well as excellent performance for Zn and Al full batteries. Theoretical modeling and experimental investigations reveal that the fractal copper array not only facilitates multivalent ion diffusion and electrolyte wetting but also effectively reduces the local current densities during cycling; Meanwhile, the CTO&#8208;based coating layer effectively blocks interfacial side reactions and enables a homogeneous ionic flux. This work opens a new avenue for developing multivalent metal batteries.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Low&#8208;Fouling Zwitterionic Polymeric Colloids as Resuscitation Fluids for Hemorrhagic Shock</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;fouling N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymer is developed as a colloid for fluid resuscitation, which simultaneously improves oncotic potency and biocompatibility to resist interference with coagulation or deposition in major organs. When used as fluid therapy in a severe hemorrhagic shock model, it significantly improves resuscitation outcomes when compared with existing colloids or plasma (the gold standard).








Abstract
Colloids, known as volume expanders, have been used as resuscitation fluids for hypovolemic shock for decades, as they increase plasma oncotic pressure and expand intravascular volume. However, recent studies show that commonly used synthetic colloids have adverse interactions with human biological systems. In this work, a low&#8208;fouling amine(N)&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymer as an alternative volume expander with improved biocompatibility and efficacy is designed. It is demonstrated that the polymer possesses antifouling ability, resisting cell interaction and deposition in major organs, and is rapidly cleared via renal filtration and hepatic circulation, reducing the risk of long&#8208;term side effects. Furthermore, in vitro and in vivo studies show an absence of adverse effects on hemostasis or any acute safety risks. Finally, it is shown that, in a head&#8208;to&#8208;head comparison with existing colloids and plasma, the zwitterionic polymer serves as a more potent oncotic agent for restoring intravascular volume in a hemorrhagic shock model. The design of N&#8208;oxide&#8208;based zwitterionic polymers may lead to the development of alternative fluid therapies to treat hypovolemic shock and to improve fluid management in general.

         <title>Approaching the Intrinsic Threshold Breakdown Voltage and Ultrahigh Gain in a Graphite/InSe Schottky&#160;Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsic threshold breakdown voltage with an ultrahigh gain is observed in an avalanche photodetector (APD) based on a graphite/InSe Schottky junction, which is attributed to the high ionization rate due to the reduced dimensionality of electron&#8211;phonon scattering in layered InSe. This work opens up a new avenue for future APDs with both low energy consumption and high sensitivity.








Abstract
Realizing both ultralow breakdown voltage and ultrahigh gain is one of the major challenges in the development of high&#8208;performance avalanche photodetector. Here, it is reported that an ultrahigh avalanche gain of 3 &#215; 105 can be realized in the graphite/InSe Schottky photodetector at a breakdown voltage down to 5.5&#160;V. Remarkably, the threshold breakdown voltage can be further reduced down to 1.8&#160;V by raising the operating temperature, approaching the theoretical limit of 1.5 Eg\[{{\cal E}_{\bf g}}\]/e, with Eg${{\cal E}_{\bf g}}$ the bandgap of semiconductor. A 2D impact ionization model is developed and it is uncovered that observation of high gain at low breakdown voltage arises from reduced dimensionality of electron&#8211;phonon scattering in the layered InSe flake. These findings open up a promising avenue for developing novel weak&#8208;light detectors with low energy consumption and high sensitivity.

         <title>Nanomaterials&#8208;Mediated Co&#8208;Stimulation of Toll&#8208;Like Receptors and CD40 for Antitumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
TLR7/8 agonist R848&#8208;derived amino lipid nanoparticle (RAL&#8208;LNP) is conceived to deliver CD40 mRNA to dendritic cells (DCs) in the tumor microenvironment to increase CD40 expression on DCs. Further combination with agonistic CD40 antibodies enables the synergistic effects of TLR7/8 and CD40 signaling pathways for DC maturation and activation, thereby promoting antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Toll&#8208;like receptors (TLRs) and CD40&#8208;related signaling pathways represent critical bridges between innate and adaptive immune responses. Here, an immunotherapy regimen that enables co&#8208;stimulation of TLR7/8&#8208;&#160;and CD40&#8208;mediated pathways is developed. TLR7/8 agonist resiquimod (R848) derived amino lipids, RAL1 and RAL2, are synthesized and formulated into RAL&#8208;derived lipid nanoparticles (RAL&#8208;LNPs). The RAL2&#8208;LNPs show efficient CD40 mRNA delivery to DCs both in vitro (90.8&#160;&#177;&#160;2.7%) and in vivo (61.3&#160;&#177;&#160;16.4%). When combined with agonistic anti&#8208;CD40 antibody, this approach can produce effective antitumor activities in mouse melanoma tumor models, thereby suppressing tumor growth, prolonging mouse survival, and establishing antitumor memory immunity. Overall, RAL2&#8208;LNPs provide a novel platform toward cancer immunotherapy by integrating innate and adaptive immunity.

         <title>Engineering Electro&#8208;Optic BaTiO3 Nanocrystals via Efficient Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates whether doping can be used to maintain the true promise of BaTiO3 as electro&#8208;optic (EO) material in films.

Electro&#8208;optic (EO) modulators provide electrical&#8208;to&#8208;optical signal conversion relevant to optical communications. Barium titanate (BaTiO3) is a promising material system for EO modulation in light of its optical ultrafast nonlinearity, low optical loss, and high refractive index. To enhance further its spontaneous polarization, BaTiO3 can be doped at the Ba and Ti sites; however, doping is often accompanied by ion migration, which diminishes EO performance. Here, donor&#8211;acceptor doping and its effect on EO efficiency are investigated, finding that La&#8208;doped BaTiO3 achieves an EO coefficient of 42 pm V&#8722;1 at 1&#160;kHz, fully twice that of the pristine specimen; however, it is also observed that, with this single&#8208;element doping, the EO response falls off rapidly with frequency. From impedance spectroscopy, it is found that frequency&#8208;dependent EO is correlated with ion migration. Density functional theory calculations predict that the ion&#8208;migration barrier decreases with La3+ doping but can be recovered with further Mn2+ doping, a finding that prompts to prevent ion migration by incorporating Mn2+ into the Ti&#8208;site to compensate for the charge imbalance.

&lt;p&gt;This work investigates whether doping can be used to maintain the true promise of BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as electro-optic (EO) material in films. The role of the donor dopant in increasing EO and, critically, of the acceptor dopant in compensating for charge imbalance and thus preventing undesired ion migration, is elucidated, providing a new route to realizing on-chip high-speed optical modulators.

         <title>Rapid Regeneration of a Neoartery with Elastic Lamellae</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neoartery regenerated from a non&#8208;porous graft fabricated from tropoelastin and polyglycerol sebacate displays cellular and extracellular matrix structures approximating the adventitia and intima&#8208;media in native mouse aorta. The adventitia contains mature collagen fibrils. Within the intima&#8208;media, an internal elastic lamina is surrounded by multiple elastic lamellae sandwiched between circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers.








Abstract
Native arteries contain a distinctive intima&#8208;media composed of organized elastin and an adventitia containing mature collagen fibrils. In contrast, implanted biodegradable small&#8208;diameter vascular grafts do not present spatially regenerated, organized elastin. The elastin&#8208;containing structures within the intima&#8208;media region encompass the elastic lamellae (EL) and internal elastic lamina (IEL) and are crucial for normal arterial function. Here, the development of a novel electrospun small&#8208;diameter vascular graft that facilitates de novo formation of a structurally appropriate elastin&#8208;containing intima&#8208;media region following implantation is described. The graft comprises a non&#8208;porous microstructure characterized by tropoelastin fibers that are embedded in a PGS matrix. After implantation in mouse abdominal aorta, the graft develops distinct cell and extracellular matrix profiles that approximate the native adventitia and intima&#8208;media by 8 weeks. Within the newly formed intima&#8208;media region there are circumferentially aligned smooth muscle cell layers that alternate with multiple EL similar to that found in the arterial wall. By 8 months, the developed adventitia region contains mature collagen fibrils and the neoartery presents a distinct IEL with thickness comparable to that in mouse abdominal aorta. It is proposed that this new class of material can generate the critically required, organized elastin needed for arterial regeneration.

         <title>Polar Species for Effective Dielectric Regulation to Achieve High&#8208;Performance CsPbI3 Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polar species modification (PSM) is employed to reduce the defect capturing probability by strengthening the defect dielectric screening effect via increasing the dielectric constant of a perovskite film. The introduction of F3EAI fills the vacancy defects at surface and also produces a hydrophobic umbrella with high resistance to humidity. PSM realizes a power conversion efficiency of 20.5% for CsPbI3 perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Nonradiative losses caused by defects are the main obstacles to further advancing the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). There is focused research to boost the device performance by reducing the number of defects and deactivating defects; however, little attention is paid to the defect&#8208;capture capacity. Here, upon systematically examining the defect&#8208;capture capacity, highly polarized fluorinated species are designed to modulate the dielectric properties of the perovskite material to minimize its defect&#8208;capture radius. On the one hand, fluorinated polar species strengthen the defect dielectric&#8208;screening effect via enhancing the dielectric constant of the perovskite film, thus reducing the defect&#8208;capture radius. On the other, the fluorinated iodized salt replenishes the I&#8208;vacancy defects at the surface, hence lowering the defect density. Consequently, the power&#8208;conversion efficiency of an all&#8208;inorganic CsPbI3 PSC is increased to as high as 20.5% with an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V and a fill factor of 82.87%, all of which are among the highest in their respective categories. Furthermore, the fluorinated species modification also produces a hydrophobic umbrella yielding significantly improved humidity tolerance, and hence long&#8208;term stability. The present strategy provides a general approach to effectually regulate the defect&#8208;capture radius, thus enhancing the optoelectronic performance.

         <title>A Peritumorally Injected Immunomodulating Adjuvant Elicits Robust and Safe Metalloimmunotherapy against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet robust immunomodulating adjuvant of Zn2+&#8208;doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) is developed to potentiate cancer metalloimmunotherapy without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH simultaneously modulates immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and induces tumor immunogenic cell death, eliciting robust antitumor immunity.








Abstract
Clinical immunotherapy of solid tumors elicits durable responses only in a minority of patients, largely due to the highly immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Although rational combinations of vaccine adjuvants with inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists that relieve immunosuppression represent an appealing therapeutic strategy against solid tumors, there are unavoidable nonspecific toxicities due to the pleiotropy of cytokines and undesired activation of off&#8208;target cells. Herein, a Zn2+ doped layered double hydroxide (Zn&#8208;LDH) based immunomodulating adjuvant, which not only relieves immunosuppression but also elicits robust antitumor immunity, is reported. Peritumorally injected Zn&#8208;LDH sustainably neutralizes acidic TME and releases abundant Zn2+, promoting a pro&#8208;inflammatory network composed of M1&#8208;tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, cytotoxic T cells, and natural&#8208;killer cells. Moreover, the Zn&#8208;LDH internalized by tumor cells effectively disrupts endo&#8208;/lysosomes to block autophagy and induces mitochondrial damage, and the released Zn2+ activates the cGas&#8208;STING signaling pathway to induce immunogenic cell death, which further promotes the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens to induce antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Unprecedentedly, merely injection of Zn&#8208;LDH adjuvant, without using any cytotoxic inflammatory cytokines or immune agonists, significantly inhibits the growth, recurrence, and metastasis of solid tumors in mice. This study provides a rational bottom&#8208;up design of potent adjuvant for cancer metalloimmunotherapy against solid tumors.

         <title>Massively Parallel Selection of NanoCluster Beacons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Approximately 40&#8197;000 distinct NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are screened on next&#8208;generation sequencing chips and new NCBs that outperform the known best NCBs are identified. Dramatic fluorescence changes are observed by substituting a single nucleotide in an NCB, which can be explained by the proposed zipper&#8208;bag model. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, bright and multicolor NCBs are designed in silico.








Abstract
NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) are multicolor silver nanocluster probes whose fluorescence can be activated or tuned by a proximal DNA strand called the activator. While a single&#8208;nucleotide difference in a pair of activators can lead to drastically different activation outcomes, termed polar opposite twins (POTs), it is difficult to discover new POT&#8208;NCBs using the conventional low&#8208;throughput characterization approaches. Here, a high&#8208;throughput selection method is reported&#160;that takes advantage of repurposed next&#8208;generation&#8208;sequencing chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8776;40&#8201;000&#160;activator sequences. It is found that the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12&#160;of the 18&#8208;nucleotide&#8208;long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6&#160;and 2&#8211;4&#160;are hotspots to generate yellow&#8211;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, a &#8220;zipper&#8208;bag&#8221; model is proposed that can explain how these hotspots facilitate the formation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter their chemical yields. Combining high&#8208;throughput screening with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, a pipeline is established to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

Here, a high-throughput selection method is reported&#160;that takes advantage of repurposed next-generation-sequencing chips to screen the activation fluorescence of &#8776;40&#8201;000&#160;activator sequences. It is found that the nucleobases at positions 7&#8211;12&#160;of the 18-nucleotide-long activator are critical to creating bright NCBs and positions 4&#8211;6&#160;and 2&#8211;4&#160;are hotspots to generate yellow&#8211;orange and red POTs, respectively. Based on these findings, a &#8220;zipper-bag&#8221; model is proposed that can explain how these hotspots facilitate the formation of distinct silver cluster chromophores and alter their chemical yields. Combining high-throughput screening with machine-learning algorithms, a pipeline is established to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Selective Metabolic Reprogramming as a Prospective PD&#8208;L1 Depression Strategy to Reactivate Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, the role of mitochondria in the programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) regulation in tumors is newly revealed, making it possible to offer a prospective PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. Moreover, multi&#8208;functional IR&#8208;LND@Alb platform&#8208;induced tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming can depress PD&#8208;L1 expression and alleviate tumor hypoxia to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize photodynamic therapy.








Abstract
Currently, the role of the lysosome, endoplasmic reticulum, or dictyosome in the transcription and translation of programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is well revealed, but the role and function of mitochondria in the PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is still not fully researched, making it hard to offer a novel PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation strategy. In this research, it is newly revealed that mitochondria oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) depression can be used as an effective PD&#8208;L1&#160;down&#8208;regulation method. To offer an ideal and high&#8208;effective tumor mitochondria&#8208;targeted OXPHOS depression nanosystem, IR&#8208;LND is prepared by conjugating mitochondria&#8208;targeted heptamethine cyanine dye IR&#8208;68&#160;with mitochondrial complexes I and II depression agent lonidamine (LND), which then further self&#8208;assembled with albumin (Alb) to form IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. By doing this, PD&#8208;L1&#160;expression in tumors is selectively and effectively depressed by IR&#8208;LND@Alb nanoparticles. As expected, the anti&#8208;tumor efficacy of such a PD&#8208;L1&#160;depression strategy is superior to conventional anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;monoclonal antibodies. Interestingly, IR&#8208;LND can also be served as a novel ideal promising photodynamic therapy (PDT) drug with self&#8208;oxygen and self&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#160;regulation capacity. All in all, this tumor&#8208;selective metabolic reprogramming platform to reactivate immunotherapy and sensitize for PDT effect, would open a new window for mitochondrial immunotherapy for cancer patients.

         <title>A Novel Multi&#8208;Sulfur Source Collaborative Chemical Bath Deposition Technology Enables 8%&#8208;Efficiency Sb2S3 Planar Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>

Sb2S3 planar solar cell with a power conversion efficiency first exceeding 8% is achieved based on the high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 absorber film fabricated using a novel multi&#8208;sulfur source collaborative chemical bath deposition technology.








Abstract
Sb2S3 as a light&#8208;harvesting material has attracted great attention for applications in both single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Such solar cell has been faced with current challenge of low power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has stagnated for 8 years. It has been recognized that the synthesis of high&#8208;quality absorber film plays a critical role in efficiency improvement. Here, using fresh precursor materials for antimony (antimony potassium tartrate) and combined sulfur (sodium thiosulfate and thioacetamide), a unique chemical bath deposition procedure is created. Due to the complexation of sodium thiosulfate and the advantageous hydrolysis cooperation between these two sulfur sources, the heterogeneous nucleation and the S2&#8208; releasing processes are boosted. As a result, there are noticeable improvements in the deposition rate, film morphology, crystallinity, and preferred orientations. Additionally, the improved film quality efficiently lowers charge trapping capacity, suppresses carrier recombination, and prolongs carrier lifetimes, leading to significantly improved photoelectric properties. Ultimately, the PCE exceeds 8% for the first time since 2014, representing the highest efficiency in all kinds of Sb2S3 solar cells to date. This study is expected to shed new light on the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2S3 film and further efficiency improvement in Sb2S3 solar cells.

         <title>Cationic Polysaccharide Conjugates as Antibiotic Adjuvants Resensitize Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacteria and Prevent Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cationic polysaccharide conjugates (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) are synthesized using controllable disulfide exchange polymerization as antibiotic adjuvants to treat multidrug&#8208;resistant Acinetobacter baumannii&#8208;induced pneumonia in mice. Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn disrupts bacterial membranes and efflux pumps, and facilitates antibiotic accumulation inside bacteria. Antibiotic efficacy is restored and bacterial resistance is prevented by Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn.








Abstract
In recent years, traditional antibiotic efficacy has rapidly diminished due to the advent of multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria, which poses severe threat to human life and globalized healthcare. Currently, the development cycle of new antibiotics cannot match the ongoing MDR infection crisis. Therefore, novel strategies are required to resensitize MDR bacteria to existing antibiotics. In this study, novel cationic polysaccharide conjugates Dextran&#8208;graft&#8208;poly(5&#8208;(1,2&#8208;dithiolan&#8208;3&#8208;yl)&#8208;N&#8208;(2&#8208;guanidinoethyl)pentanamide) (Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSSn) is synthesized using disulfide exchange polymerization. Critically, bacterial membranes and efflux pumps are disrupted by a sub&#8208;inhibitory concentration of Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30, which enhances rifampicin (RIF) accumulation inside bacteria and restores its efficacy. Combined Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 and RIF prevents bacterial resistance in bacteria cultured over 30 generations. Furthermore, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 restores RIF effectiveness, reduces inflammatory reactions in a pneumonia&#8208;induced mouse model, and exhibits excellent in vivo biological absorption and degradation capabilities. As an antibiotic adjuvant, Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 provides a novel resensitizing strategy for RIF against MDR bacteria and bacterial resistance. This Dex&#8208;g&#8208;PSS30 research provides a solid platform for future MDR applications.

         <title>A Silica&#8208;Reinforced Composite Electrolyte with Greatly Enhanced Interfacial Lithium&#8208;Ion Transfer Kinetics for High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte composed of fumed silica and poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based gel polymer electrolyte is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, homogeneous Li+ flux regulation, and inorganic Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase, the prepared solid&#8208;like electrolyte enables superb cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Developing quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, a novel solid&#8208;like electrolyte (SLE) with enhanced Li+ interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8211;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li+&#8208;transport channels, the prepared SLE exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the SLE can homogenize Li+ flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li2S&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on the lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the SLE. Therefore, the lithium&#8208;metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8211;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li2S&#8208;rich SEI, as well as the homogeneous Li+ flux. Full cells with LiFePO4 cathode can still display&#160;a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2&#8201;C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy on quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes provides a promising avenue for next&#8208;generation metal&#8208;based batteries.

&lt;p&gt;A quasi-solid-state electrolyte composed of fumed silica and poly(vinylidene fluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-hexafluoropropylene)-based gel polymer electrolyte is designed and fabricated. Benefiting from the high ionic conductivity, good mechanical strength, homogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux regulation, and inorganic Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich solid electrolyte interphase, the prepared solid-like electrolyte enables superb cycling stability of lithium-metal batteries.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Developing quasi-solid-state electrolytes with superior ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength is urgently desired to improve the safety and cycling stability of lithium-metal batteries. Herein, a novel solid-like electrolyte (SLE) with enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; interfacial transfer kinetics is rationally designed by soaking bulk nanostructured silica&#8211;polymer composites in liquid electrolytes. Benefiting from the high content of inorganic silica and abundant interfaces for fast Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-transport channels, the prepared SLE exhibits superb ionic conductivity and high mechanical strength. Furthermore, fumed silica with a high specific area in the SLE can homogenize Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux and electrical field gradient. More importantly, a Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) is constructed on the lithium metal due to the intimate ion coordination in the SLE. Therefore, the lithium-metal anode exhibits excellent electrochemical performance in symmetric Li&#8211;Li cells due to the merits of superior ionic conductivity, high modulus, Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S-rich SEI, as well as the homogeneous Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; flux. Full cells with LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; cathode can still display&#160;a capacity retention of 98% at 0.2&#8201;C after 400 cycles. The proposed strategy on quasi-solid-state electrolytes provides a promising avenue for next-generation metal-based batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Memory Window of van der Waals Heterostructure Devices Based on MOCVD&#8208;Grown 2D Layered Ge4Se9</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ge4Se9, a new insulating 2D&#8208;layered material, is synthesized using metal&#8211;organic chemical vapor deposition at 240 &#176;C&#160;with&#160;low&#8208;reactive&#160;precursors.&#160;The 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 forms a low band offset with MoS2, exhibiting a large memory window with linear gate&#8208;tunability. As an artificial synapse, the MoS2/Ge4Se9 heterostructure exhibits synaptic updates with low non&#8208;linearity of 0.26 and low energy consumption of 15 fJ.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have drawn much interest over the last decade owing to their absence of dangling bonds and their intriguing low&#8208;dimensional properties. The emergence of 2D materials has enabled the achievement of significant progress in both the discovery of physical phenomena and the realization of superior devices. In this work, the group IV metal chalcogenide 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is introduced as a new selection of insulating vdW material. 2D&#8208;layered Ge4Se9 is synthesized with a rectangular shape using the metalcorganic chemical vapor deposition system using a liquid germanium precursor at 240 &#176;C. By stacking the Ge4Se9 and MoS2, vdW heterostructure devices are fabricated with a giant memory window of 129&#160;V by sweeping back gate range of &#177;80&#160;V. The gate&#8208;independent decay time reveals that the large hysteresis is induced by the interfacial charge transfer, which originates from the low band offset. Moreover, repeatable conductance changes are observed over the 2250 pulses with low non&#8208;linearity values of 0.26 and 0.95 for potentiation and depression curves, respectively. The energy consumption of the MoS2/Ge4Se9 device is about 15 fJ for operating energy and the learning accuracy of image classification reaches 88.3%, which further proves the great potential of artificial synapses.

         <title>Crystalline Lattice&#8208;Confined Atomic Pt in Metal Carbides to Match Electronic Structures and Hydrogen Evolution Behaviors of Platinum</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides with &#8220;real&#8221; matched properties as metallic platinum are developed using Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#63743;W/Mo covalent bonds. The WC lattice&#8208;confined Pt atoms exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states, similar electronic structures, and matched hydrogen evolution behaviors as Pt(111) surface; remarkably, they offer 40 times greater mass activity than Pt@C&#8208;20% in alkaline conditions.








Abstract
Platinum&#8208;based catalysts occupy a pivotal position in diverse catalytic applications in hydrogen chemistry and electrochemistry, for instance, the hydrogen evolution reactions (HER). While adsorbed Pt atoms on supports often cause severe mismatching on electronic structures and HER behaviors from metallic Pt due to the different energy level distribution of electron orbitals. Here, the design of crystalline lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in metal carbides using the Pt&#8208;centered polyoxometalate frameworks with strong Pt&#63743;O&#8208;metal covalent bonds is reported. Remarkably, the lattice&#8208;confined atomic Pt in the tungsten carbides (Ptdoped@WCx, both Pt and W have atomic radii of 1.3&#160;&#197;) exhibit near&#8208;zero valence states and similar electronic structures as metallic Pt, thus delivering matched energy level distributions of the Pt 5dz2 and H 1s orbitals and similar acidic hydrogen evolution behaviors. In alkaline conditions, the Ptdoped@WCx exhibits 40 times greater mass activity (49.5&#160;A&#160;mgPt&#8722;1 at &#951;&#160;=&#160;150&#160;mV) than the Pt@C because of the favorable water dissociation and H* transport. These findings offer a universal pathway to construct urgently needed atomic&#8208;scale catalysts for broad catalytic reactions.

         <dc:description>
N,B co&#8208;doped conductive hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies are rationally synthesized and used for Li&#8211;S batteries. The catalysts can subtly guide the Li2S nucleation and deposition in the 3D framework, avoiding the formation of L2S passivation layer and leaving enough channels for the continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S.








Abstract
Currently, extensive research efforts are being devoted to suppressing the shuttle effect of polysulfides. The uncontrollable deposition of insulating Li2S onto the surface of sulfur host materials dramatically inhibits the continuous reduction of polysulfides in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Herein, N,B co&#8208;doped hollow carbon microspheres embedded with dense FeSe&#8211;MnSe heterostructures and abundant Se vacancies (FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC) are rationally designed and synthesized via a facile hydrothermal reaction using ionic liquids as dopants. The introduction of abundant heterostructures subtly guides Li2S nucleation and deposition in 3D frameworks, thus avoiding the formation of the Li2S passivation layer and allowing for continuous Li+ diffusion and subsequent nucleation of Li2S. Owing to these beneficial features, Li&#8211;S batteries comprising an FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC electrode exhibit significantly improved performance, including a high initial capacity of 1334 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and ultralong cycle stability with a low capacity fading rate of 0.029% cycle&#8722;1 over 1000 cycles at 1.0 C. Remarkably, the FeSe&#8211;MnSe/NBC pouch cell delivers a considerable areal capacity of 3.6 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This study provides valuable insight into heterostructures and Se vacancies for developing practical Li&#8211;S batteries.

         <title>Probing the Spin Dimensionality in Single&#8208;Layer CrSBr Van Der Waals Heterostructures by Magneto&#8208;Transport Measurements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The magneto&#8208;transport properties of 2D CrSBr vertical van der Waals heterostructures are inspected, revealing a spontaneous spin alignment along the b&#8208;axis together with spin&#8208;reorientation and field&#8208;induced phases. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed with large negative magnetoresistance. This makes CrSBr of high interest not only as a new 2D magnetic model but also as a potential spintronic component.








Abstract
2D magnetic materials offer unprecedented opportunities for fundamental and applied research in spintronics and magnonics. Beyond the pioneering studies on 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6, the field has expanded to 2D antiferromagnets exhibiting different spin anisotropies and textures. Of particular interest is the layered metamagnet CrSBr, a relatively air&#8208;stable semiconductor formed by antiferromagnetically&#8208;coupled ferromagnetic layers (Tc&#8764;150 K) that can be exfoliated down to the single&#8208;layer. It presents a complex magnetic behavior with a dynamic magnetic crossover, exhibiting a low&#8208;temperature hidden&#8208;order below T*&#8764;40 K. Here, the magneto&#8208;transport properties of CrSBr vertical heterostructures in the 2D limit are inspected. The results demonstrate the marked low&#8208;dimensional character of the ferromagnetic monolayer, with short&#8208;range correlations above Tc and an Ising&#8208;type in&#8208;plane anisotropy, being the spins spontaneously aligned along the easy axis b below Tc. By applying moderate magnetic fields along a and c axes, a spin&#8208;reorientation occurs, leading to a magnetoresistance enhancement below T*. In multilayers, a spin&#8208;valve behavior is observed, with negative magnetoresistance strongly enhanced along the three directions below T*. These results show that CrSBr monolayer/bilayer provides an ideal platform for studying and controlling field&#8208;induced phenomena in two&#8208;dimensions, offering new insights regarding 2D magnets and their integration into vertical spintronic devices.

         <title>Perovskite or Not Perovskite? A Deep&#8208;Learning Approach to Automatically Identify New Hybrid Perovskites from X&#8208;ray Diffraction Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A deep&#8208;learning approach is developed to automatically and accurately assign the structure type from the X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns of new hybrid lead halides. An accuracy of 92% is obtained and the new insights provided by the model allow the ability of scientists to discriminate manually between different structure types of new materials to be augmented.








Abstract
Determining the crystal structure is a critical step in the discovery of new functional materials. This process is time consuming and requires extensive human expertise in crystallography. Here, a machine&#8208;learning&#8208;based approach is developed, which allows it to be determined automatically if an unknown material is of perovskite type from&#160;powder X&#8208;ray diffraction. After training a deep&#8208;learning model on a dataset of known compounds, the structure types of new unknown compounds can be predicted using their experimental powder X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns. This strategy is used to distinguish perovskite&#8208;type materials in a series of new hybrid lead halides. After validation, this approach is shown to accurately identify perovskites (accuracy of 92% with convolutional neural network). From the identification of the key features of the patterns used to discriminate perovskites versus nonperovskites, crystallographers can learn how to quickly identify low&#8208;dimensional perovskites from X&#8208;ray diffraction patterns.

         <title>Realizing a 10&#160;&#176;C Cooling Effect in a Flexible Thermoelectric Cooler Using a Vortex Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a film&#8208;based FTEC, which shows outstanding cooling performance by using an innovative quadra&#8208;layered structure and a light vortex generator (VG). The FTEC consumes 68.5&#160;W to maintain a comfortable Tskin in the major hot spots of the walking human body, as strongly opposed to its ultrahigh counterpart (1.5&#160;kW) by traditional centralized cooling systems.








Abstract
In this study, flexible thermoelectric coolers (FTECs) are used to develop an alternative personalized cooling technology to achieve a large temperature drop of 10 &#176;C and cooling capacity of 256 W m&#8211;2. Such an excellent cooling performance is attributed to the innovative design of the quadra&#8208;layered Ag2Se/poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate structure in FTECs and the induced air vortices by the vortex generator attached to the hot surface of the device. The applied pulse&#8208;width modulation technique guarantees human body comfort at inconsistent ambient temperature by modulating the duty ratio of the power source, which also saves 35% of the power consumption. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared FTECs only consume 68.5&#160;W so as to maintain a comfortable skin temperature (32&#160;&#177;&#160;0.5 &#176;C) when the ambient temperature is at 31 &#176;C. This technology provides a reliable and adjustable solution for personalized cooling in environments where comfortable temperatures are exceeded.

         <title>Zn&#8208;Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Derived Ordered Mesoporous Carbon&#8208;Based Nanostructure for High&#8208;Performance and Universal Multivalent Metal Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Cu&#8208;doped Zn&#8211;MOF (metal&#8211;organic framework) derived orderly mesoporous carbon&#8208;based nanostructure is synthesized by template&#8208;free pyrolysis and the Cu doping presents a direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation process of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. This orderly mesoporous derivative provides a fruitful platform to achieve a class of high&#8208;performance electrodes for universal multivalent metal ion storage in aqueous electrolytes.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derivatives promise great potential in energy storage and conversion because of their excellent tunability in both the active metal sites, organic links, and the overall structures down to atomic and up to mesoscale. Nevertheless, a big challenge is to precisely control and thoroughly understand the actual MOF&#8208;to&#8208;derivative conversion process to realize the template&#8208;free synthesis of the MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous materials. Here, a class of ordered mesoporous N&#8208;doped carbon nanoflakes is presented with slit&#8208;shaped pores synthesized by one&#8208;step pyrolysis of Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF, where the Cu doping plays a critically important direction&#8208;inducing function on the dissociation of organic ligands during the pyrolysis. Benefiting from the uniquely ordered mesoporous structure and large specific surface area (910 m2 g&#8722;1), the Zn1Cux&#8211;MOF&#8208;derived ordered mesoporous carbon nanoflakes present outstanding electrochemical storage performance for multivalent metal ions, such as Mg2+, Ca2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Al3+, and Zn2+, demonstrating the universal nature of the slit&#8208;shaped pores in enabling the multivalent metal ions for energy storage. Moreover, the assembled flexible Zn&#8208;ion hybrid supercapacitor (ZHSC) delivers a high specific capacity of 134 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, excellent cycling and mechanical stability, showing great application potential in the new generation energy storage devices.

Lithium bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (LiFSI) salt is stripped of fluorine at the anode and further decomposed at the cathode, causing a 3&#215; reduction in lithium solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth relative to symmetric cells and a 3&#215; increase in cathode capacity fade relative to cells with graphite anode.








Abstract
While crossover effects, such as transition&#8208;metal dissolution, are well&#8208;understood in lithium&#8208;ion batteries, there is a limited understanding of the effect of crossed&#8208;over chemical species in cells with oxide cathodes and lithium&#8208;metal anodes. In this work, the effects of cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode and anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode crossover are explored in cells with a high&#8208;nickel cathode, lithium&#8208;metal anode, and a localized high&#8208;concentration electrolyte (LHCE). Dramatic differences are found among cells; a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with a high&#8208;nickel cathode has three times less solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase growth than a lithium&#8208;metal anode paired with lithium metal. Meanwhile, the cathode paired with lithium metal has 2&#8211;3 times higher capacity fade than the same cathode paired with graphite. Decomposition and crossover of the FSI salt is identified as the main source of these changes. The fluorine in the salt is first stripped off at the lithium&#8208;metal anode, and the remaining sulfur and nitrogen cross over to the cathode. Although the reduction in fluorine content harms the surface stability of the cathode, the lithium&#8208;metal anode benefits from the increased fluorine content. Because the lithium&#8208;metal anode is typically the bottleneck for cells with thin lithium, crossover is a major factor in the enhanced performance of lithium&#8208;metal batteries with LHCE.

         <title>Overcoming the Limitations of MXene Electrodes for Solution&#8208;Processed Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recently, various applications of MXenes have been intensively explored, except for optoelectronics, in which poor environmental stability severely impedes their practical application. This work provides a simple but effective approach to develop an environmentally stable MXene electrode that exhibits a high work function of 5.84 eV and distinguished solution processibility as the electrode for large&#8208;area organic light&#8208;emitting diodes.








Abstract
MXenes constitute a rapidly growing family of 2D materials that are promising for optoelectronic applications because of numerous attractive properties, including high electrical conductivity. However, the most widely used titanium carbide (Ti3C2Tx) MXene transparent conductive electrode exhibits insufficient environmental stability and work function (WF), which impede practical applications Ti3C2Tx electrodes in solution&#8208;processed optoelectronics. Herein, Ti3C2Tx MXene film with a compact structure and a perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) barrier layer is presented as a promising electrode for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). The electrode shows excellent environmental stability, high WF of 5.84&#160;eV, and low sheet resistance RS of 97.4&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. The compact Ti3C2Tx structure after thermal annealing resists intercalation of moisture and environmental contaminants. In addition, the PFSA surface modification passivates interflake defects and modulates the WF. Thus, changes in the WF and RS are negligible even after 22&#160;days of exposure to ambient air. The Ti3C2Tx MXene is applied for large&#8208;area, 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;passive matrix flexible OLEDs on substrates measuring 6&#160;&#215;&#160;6&#160;cm. This work provides a simple but efficient strategy to overcome both the limited environmental stability and low WF of MXene electrodes for solution&#8208;processable optoelectronics.

         <title>Real&#8208;Time Measurement of Cell Mechanics as a Clinically Relevant Readout of an In Vitro Lung Fibrosis Model Established on a Bioinspired Basement Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;breathing&#8221; human&#8208;based in vitro mini&#8208;lung with a patient&#8208;derived triple coculture fibrosis model introduces longitudinal pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics studies to in vitro testing of inhaled drugs. This technology relies on a novel copolymeric basement membrane for cell culturing, which overcomes the shortcomings of silicon&#8208;based membranes, and on a novel method for real&#8208;time monitoring tissue mechanics as clinically relevant functional readout.








Abstract
Lung fibrosis, one of the major post&#8208;COVID&#160;complications, is a progressive and ultimately fatal disease without a cure. Here, an organ&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific&#160;in vitro&#160;mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model equipped with noninvasive real&#8208;time monitoring of cell mechanics is introduced as a functional readout. To establish an intricate multiculture model under physiologic conditions, a biomimetic ultrathin basement (biphasic elastic thin for air&#8211;liquid culture conditions, BETA) membrane (&lt;1&#160;&#181;m) is developed&#160;with unique properties, including biocompatibility,&#160;permeability, and high elasticity (&lt;10&#160;kPa) for cell culturing under air&#8211;liquid interface and cyclic mechanical stretch conditions. The human&#8208;based triple coculture fibrosis model, which includes epithelial and endothelial cell lines combined with primary fibroblasts from&#160;idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients established on the BETA membrane, is integrated into a millifluidic bioreactor system (cyclic in vitro cell&#8208;stretch, CIVIC) with dose&#8208;controlled aerosolized drug delivery, mimicking inhalation therapy. The real&#8208;time measurement of cell/tissue stiffness (and compliance) is shown as a clinical biomarker of the progression/attenuation of fibrosis upon drug treatment, which is confirmed for&#160;inhaled&#160;Nintedanib&#8212;an antifibrosis drug.&#160;The mini&#8208;lung fibrosis model allows the combined longitudinal testing of pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of drugs, which is expected to enhance the predictive capacity of&#160;preclinical&#160;models&#160;and hence facilitate the development of approved therapies for lung fibrosis.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Protein Glues with Superior Adhesion Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of protein complex glues with outstanding adhesion performance is fabricated by molecular engineering. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the protein complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. The combined robust interfacial adhesion and superior antibacterial activity endow the materials as highly favorable for visceral hemostasis and tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Naturally inspired proteins are investigated for the development of bioglues that combine adhesion performance and biocompatibility for biomedical applications. However, engineering such adhesives by rational design of the proteins at the molecular level is rarely reported. Herein, it is shown that a new generation of protein&#8208;based glues is generated by supramolecular assembly through de novo designed structural proteins in which arginine triggers robust liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The encoded arginine moieties significantly strengthen multiple molecular interactions in the complex, leading to ultrastrong adhesion on various surfaces, outperforming many chemically reacted and biomimetic glues. Such adhesive materials enable quick visceral hemostasis in 10 s and outstanding tissue regeneration due to their robust adhesion, good biocompatibility, and superior antibacterial capacity. Remarkably, their minimum inhibitory concentrations are orders of magnitude lower than clinical antibiotics. These advances offer insights into molecular engineering of de novo designed protein glues and outline a general strategy to fabricate mechanically strong protein&#8208;based materials for surgical applications.

         <title>A Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Enhanced Simultaneous and Multimodal Sensor Based on Moist&#8208;Electric Powered Graphene Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Graphene oxide multimodal sensor (GO&#8208;MS) capable of self&#8208;powered sensing of various environmental stimuli based on a spontaneously generated moist&#8208;electric potential is developed. Through the decoupling of characteristic response signals by machine&#8208;learning models, simultaneous monitoring of multiple stimuli by a single GO&#8208;MS is realized, providing a promising technical means for real&#8208;time multimodal perception and complex information system identification.








Abstract
Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of a future human&#8211;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multisensor networks with cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process have heavily restricted practical applications.

&lt;p&gt;Graphene oxide multimodal sensor (GO-MS) capable of self-powered sensing of various environmental stimuli based on a spontaneously generated moist-electric potential is developed. Through the decoupling of characteristic response signals by machine-learning models, simultaneous monitoring of multiple stimuli by a single GO-MS is realized, providing a promising technical means for real-time multimodal perception and complex information system identification.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Simultaneous multimodal monitoring can greatly perceive intricately multiple stimuli, which is important for the understanding and development of a future human&#8211;machine fusion world. However, the integrated multisensor networks with cumbersome structure, huge power consumption, and complex preparation process have heavily restricted practical applications. Herein, a graphene oxide single-component multimodal sensor (GO-MS) is developed, which enables simultaneous monitoring of multiple environmental stimuli by a single unit with unique moist-electric self-power supply. This GO-MS can generate a sustainable moist-electric potential by spontaneously adsorbing water molecules in air, which has a characteristic response behavior when exposed to different stimuli. As a result, the simultaneous monitoring and decoupling of the changes of temperature, humidity, pressure, and light intensity are achieved by this single GO-MS with machine-learning (ML) assistance. Of practical importance, a moist-electric-powered human&#8211;machine interaction wristband based on GO-MS is constructed to monitor pulse signals, body temperature, and sweating in a multidimensional manner, as well as gestures and sign language commanding communication. This ML-empowered moist-electric GO-MS provides a new platform for the development of self-powered single-component multimodal sensors, showing great potential for applications in the fields of health detection, artificial electronic skin, and the Internet-of-Things.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 Ternary Alloy Nanosheets to Boost Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. Ternary alloying produces a miscible phase over a wide range. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions and support that ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.








Abstract
Alloying of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a pioneering method for engineering electronic structures with expanded applications. In this study, MoSe2&#8211;VSe2&#8211;NbSe2 ternary alloy nanosheets are synthesized via a colloidal reaction. The composition is successfully tuned over a wide range to adjust the 2H&#8211;1T phase transition. The alloy nanosheets consist of miscible atomic structures at all compositions, which is distinct from immiscible binary alloys. Compared to each binary alloy, the ternary alloys display higher electrocatalytic activity toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) in an acidic electrolyte. The HER performance exhibits a volcano&#8208;type composition dependence, which is correlated with the experimental d&#8208;band center (&#949;d). Spin&#8208;polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations consistently predict the homogenous atomic distributions. The Gibbs free energy of H adsorption (&#916;GH*) and the activation barrier (Ea) support that miscible ternary alloying greatly enhances the HER performance.

         <title>Balancing the Selective Absorption and Photon&#8208;to&#8208;Electron Conversion for Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics with 5.0% Light&#8208;Utilization Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Balancing the selective absorption and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Following this, ST&#8208;OPV with a high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0% is reached via comprehensive optimization on materials, active layers, and device structures. Furthermore, the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good upscaling and thermal control ability, representing a promising candidate adaptive to versatile applications.








Abstract
Efficiently converting invisible light while allowing full visible light transmission is key to achieving high&#8208;performance semitransparent organic photovoltaics (ST&#8208;OPVs). Here, a detailed balance strategy is explored to optimize the ST&#8208;OPV via taking both absorption and carrier dynamics into consideration. Based on this principle, comprehensive optimizations are carried out, including a ternary strategy, donor:acceptor blend ratio, thickness, antireflection, etc., to compromise the invisible energy conversion and visible transmission for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs. As a result, the opaque OPV device exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.35% (certificated 19.07%), and most strikingly, the best ST&#8208;OPV shows a remarkably high light&#8208;utilization efficiency of 5.0%, where the efficiency and the average visible transmission are 12.95% and 38.67%, respectively. An efficiency of 12.09% is achieved on the upscaled device with an area of 1.05 cm2, demonstrating its promise for large&#8208;area fabrication. These results are among the best values for ST&#8208;OPVs. Besides, it is demonstrated that the ST&#8208;OPV exhibits good infrared light&#8208;reflection capability for thermal control. This work provides a rational design of balancing the absorbing selectivity and photon&#8208;to&#8208;electron conversion for high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OPVs, and may pave the way toward the practical application of solar windows.

         <title>Perovskite Wide&#8208;Angle Field&#8208;Of&#8208;View Camera</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras (fish eye camera and compound eye camera) simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution is still a huge challenge. To solve this problem, a new type of wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite&#8208;based photodetector and computational technology.








Abstract
Researchers have attempted to create wide&#8208;angle field&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOV) cameras inspired by the structure of the eyes of animals, including fisheye and compound eye cameras. However, realizing wide&#8208;angle FOV cameras simultaneously exhibiting low distortion and high spatial resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel wide&#8208;angle FOV camera is developed by combining a single large&#8208;area flexible perovskite photodetector (FP&#8208;PD) using computational technology. With this camera, the proposed single&#8208;photodetector imaging technique can obtain high&#8208;spatial&#8208;resolution images using only a single detector, and the large&#8208;area FP&#8208;PD can be bent further to collect light from a wide&#8208;angle FOV. The proposed camera demonstrates remarkable features of an extraordinarily tunable wide FOV (greater than 150&#176;), high spatial resolution of 256&#160;&#215;&#160;256 pixels, and low distortion. It is believed that the proposed compatible and extensible camera prototype will promote the development of high&#8208;performance versatile FOV cameras.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Negative Differential Resistance and High Tunneling Current Density in GeSn Esaki Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Negative differential resistance (NDR) in GeSn Esaki diodes at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios is reported. By applying tensile stresses on GeSn epitaxial films, a record&#8208;high tunneling current density of 0.5 MA cm&#8722;2 is achieved among all group&#8208;IV Esaki diodes since phonon participation is no longer required in direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin.








Abstract
Tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs) are a promising candidate for low&#8208;power applications owing to their steep subthreshold swing of sub&#8208;60 mV per decade. For silicon&#8208; or germanium&#8208;based TFETs, the drive current is low due to the indirect band&#8208;to&#8208;band tunneling (BTBT) process. Direct&#8208;bandgap germanium&#8211;tin (GeSn) can boost the TFET performance since phonon participation is not required during the tunneling process. Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high&#8208;performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak&#8208;to&#8208;valley current ratios of 15&#8211;53 from 300 K to 4 K. A record&#8208;high peak current density of 545 kA cm&#8722;2 at 4 K is also reported for the tensile&#8208;strained Ge0.925Sn0.075 device (strain &#8776;0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile&#8208;strained n&#8208;GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.

Esaki diodes with negative differential resistance (NDR) are used to characterize the BTBT properties and calibrate the tunneling rates for TFET applications. This work demonstrates high-performance GeSn Esaki diodes with clear NDR at room temperature with very high peak-to-valley current ratios of 15&#8211;53 from 300 K to 4 K. A record-high peak current density of 545 kA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at 4 K is also reported for the tensile-strained Ge&lt;sub&gt;0.925&lt;/sub&gt;Sn&lt;sub&gt;0.075&lt;/sub&gt; device (strain &#8776;0.6 %). By applying tensile stresses to n-GeSn epitaxial films, the direct BTBT process dominates, leading to high tunneling rates. Hall measurements further confirm that more electrons populate in the direct &#915; valley in the tensile-strained n-GeSn epitaxial&#160;films.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells with a High Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Over 1.2&#160;V Achieved by a Dual&#8208;Side Passivation Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New synthesized non&#8208;conjugated polyelectrolyte is introduced as an interfacial layer between the charge&#8208;transport layer and perovskite absorbent, which significantly reduce both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination losses, but also aligns the interface's energy level. The modified perovskite solar cells show a power conversion efficiency of 24.4% (open&#8208;circuit voltage 1.21&#160;V) with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Suppressing nonradiative recombination at the interface between the organometal halide perovskite (PVK) and the charge&#8208;transport layer (CTL) is crucial for improving the efficiency and stability of PVK&#8208;based solar cells (PSCs). Here, a new bathocuproine (BCP)&#8208;based nonconjugated polyelectrolyte (poly&#8208;BCP) is synthesized and this is introduced as a &#8220;dual&#8208;side passivation layer&#8221; between the tin oxide (SnO2) CTL and the PVK absorber. Poly&#8208;BCP significantly suppresses both bulk and interfacial nonradiative recombination by passivating oxygen&#8208;vacancy defects from the SnO2 side and simultaneously scavenges ionic defects from the other (PVK) side. Therefore, PSCs with poly&#8208;BCP exhibits a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.4% and a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.21&#160;V with a reduced voltage loss (PVK bandgap of 1.56&#160;eV). The non&#8208;encapsulated PSCs also show excellent long&#8208;term stability by retaining 93% of the initial PCE after 700 h under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation in nitrogen atmosphere conditions.

         <title>Construction of Ultrathin S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions of Single Ni Atom Immobilized Ti&#8208;MOF and BiVO4 for CO2 Photoconversion of nearly 100% to CO by Pure Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>

Wide&#8208;spectrum heterojunctions are successfully fabricated by coupling single&#8208;atom Ni immobilized single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer NTU&#8208;9 as a reformative reduction half semiconductor with 2DBiVO4 through H&#8208;bonding induction, which represents a novel S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalyst model. Favorable charge separation and efficient catalytic sites of single Ni atoms with unique local microenvironment synergistically promote CO2 photoconversion, achieving up to 66&#8208;fold conversion rate by pure water compared to reference BiVO4 nanoparticles, together with nearly 100% selectivity to CO without any H2.








Abstract
To rationally design single&#8208;atom metal&#8211;organic&#160;framework&#160;(MOF)&#8208;involving photocatalysts remains an ongoing challenge for efficient CO2 conversion. Here, cuppy microstructures, consisting of a Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and three linked carboxylic moieties, in the single&#8208;coordination&#8208;layer Ti2(H2dobdc)3 MOF (NTU&#8208;9) are exploited to immobilize abundant single Ni(II) sites (Ni@MOF). The coupling of Ni@MOF with BiVO4 (BVO) nanosheets by H&#8208;bonding&#8208;induced assembly process obtains wide&#8208;spectrum 2D heterojunctions. The optimal heterojunction exhibits competitive performance and enables around 66&#8208;fold CO2 conversion of that for BVO nanoparticles by pure water, with nearly 100% CO selectivity. The exceptional photoactivity is attributed to favorable S&#8208;scheme charge transfer from BVO to MOF then to single Ni(II) sites. Noteworthily, single Ni(II) sites anchored by the Ti(IV)&#8208;oxo node and vicinal carboxylic moieties serving as a unique local microenvironment (LME) are found to synergistically catalyze CO2 conversion. Specifically, the hydroxyl groups of carboxylic moieties can form H&#8208;bonds with CO2 to promote its adsorption on single Ni(II) sites, and also can provide accessible protons to facilitate H&#8208;assisted CO2 reduction. Moreover, the CO desorption and subsequent CO2 adsorption on single Ni(II) sites with LME is proved to be thermodynamically favored, and hence dominates the high CO selectivity. This work highlights the significance of modulating the LME of single atoms to rationally design photocatalysts for realizing carbon neutralization.

Abstract
Materials with target nonlinear mechanical response can support the design of innovative soft robots, wearable devices, footwear, and energy&#8208;absorbing systems, yet it is challenging to realize them. Here, mechanical metamaterials based on hinged quadrilaterals are used as a platform to realize target nonlinear mechanical responses. It is first shown that by changing the shape of the quadrilaterals, the amount of internal rotations induced by the applied compression can be tuned, and a wide range of mechanical responses is achieved. Next, a neural network is introduced that provides a computationally inexpensive relationship between the parameters describing the geometry and the corresponding stress&#8211;strain response. Finally, it is shown that by combining the neural network with an evolution strategy, one can efficiently identify geometries resulting in a wide range of target nonlinear mechanical responses and design optimized energy&#8208;absorbing systems, soft robots, and morphing&#160;structures.

         <title>Observation of Superconducting Collective Modes from Competing Pairing Instabilities in Single&#8208;Layer NbSe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental observation of Leggett collective modes in the superconducting state of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) is reported. Leggett modes have been rarely seen in nature and represent the first type of collective modes observed in 2D TMD superconductors, which highlights the rather unconventional superconducting properties of this family of materials in the single&#8208;layer limit.








Abstract
In certain unconventional superconductors with sizable electronic correlations, the availability of closely competing pairing channels leads to characteristic soft collective fluctuations of the order parameters, which leave fingerprints in many observables and allow the phase competition to be scrutinized. Superconducting layered materials, where electron&#8211;electron interactions are enhanced with decreasing thickness, are promising candidates to display these correlation effects. In this work, the existence of a soft collective mode in single&#8208;layer NbSe2, observed as a characteristic resonance excitation in high&#8208;resolution tunneling spectra is reported. This resonance is observed along with higher harmonics, its frequency &#937;/2&#916;&#160;is anticorrelated with the local superconducting gap &#916;, and its amplitude gradually vanishes by increasing the temperature and upon applying a magnetic field up to the critical values (TC and HC2), which sets an unambiguous link to the superconducting state. Aided by a microscopic model that captures the main experimental observations, this resonance is interpreted as a collective Leggett mode that represents the fluctuation toward a proximate f&#8208;wave triplet state, due to subleading attraction in the triplet channel. These findings demonstrate the fundamental role of correlations in superconducting 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, opening a path toward unconventional superconductivity in simple, scalable, and transferable 2D superconductors.

Fluorescent Nanomaterials
By repurposing next&#8208;generation sequencing chips, millions of fluorescent NanoCluster Beacons (NCBs) can be screened in a single experiment. Combining this high&#8208;throughput screening platform with machine&#8208;learning algorithms, in article number 2204957, Hsin&#8208;Chih Yeh and co&#8208;workers establish a pipeline to design bright and multicolor NCBs in silico.

Biomimetic Membranes
In article number 2205083, Ali Doryab, Otmar Schmid, and co&#8208;workers describe how a biomimetic basement (BETA) membrane with a thickness of only 1 &#956;m and excellent biocompatibility demonstrates the formation of the nanoscale fibrous network structure of extracellular matrix proteins (green) deposited by the cells (violet). These unique features of the BETA membrane including Young's modulus &lt;10 kPa allow monitoring of cell mechanics in real&#8208;time.

         <title>Recent Progress in Smart Polymeric Gel&#8208;Based Information Storage for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
New anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials to deal with the endless phenomena of information leakage and misinformation are a very important and promising field. As one of the most attractive candidates, smart gels possess excellent modifiability and unique stimulus responsiveness. Moreover, elaborate polymeric gels with chemical or physical colors can display polychrome and multistage information through the synergy of multiple functions.








Abstract
Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies.

     alt="Recent Progress in Smart Polymeric Gel-Based Information Storage for Anti-Counterfeiting"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;New anti-counterfeiting materials to deal with the endless phenomena of information leakage and misinformation are a very important and promising field. As one of the most attractive candidates, smart gels possess excellent modifiability and unique stimulus responsiveness. Moreover, elaborate polymeric gels with chemical or physical colors can display polychrome and multistage information through the synergy of multiple functions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti-counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies. Modified intelligent polymeric gels exhibit color changes and shape morphing under external stimuli, which give them great potential for applications in information storage. This paper provides an overview of the latest progress in polymeric gel-based information storage materials in relation to counterfeiting. Following a brief introduction of anti-counterfeiting materials, the preparation methods for intelligent gels with adjustable colors (e.g., chemical colors and physical colors) and various encryption/decryption modes involving dimensions and diverse colors are outlined. Finally, the challenges and prospects for information storage and anti-counterfeiting based on smart gels are discussed.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Emerging Solid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Phase&#8208;Change Materials for Thermal&#8208;Energy Harvesting, Storage, and Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 41, October 13, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An holistic analysis on the recent developments of solid&#8208;state phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) for innovative thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) applications. The phase&#8208;transition fundamentals of solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid (S&#8211;S) PCMs are introduced and discussed, developing strategies and molecular engineering design toward potential applications. The current challenges and future research directions on S&#8211;S PCMs in TES applications are also proposed.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) offer tremendous potential to store thermal energy during reversible phase transitions for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art applications. The practicality of these materials is adversely restricted by volume expansion, phase segregation, and leakage problems associated with conventional solid&#8208;liquid PCMs. Solid&#8211;solid PCMs, as promising alternatives to solid&#8211;liquid PCMs, are gaining much attention toward practical thermal&#8208;energy storage (TES) owing to their inimitable advantages such as solid&#8208;state processing, negligible volume change during phase transition, no contamination, and long cyclic life. Herein, the aim is to provide a holistic analysis of solid&#8211;solid PCMs suitable for thermal&#8208;energy harvesting, storage, and utilization. The developing strategies of solid&#8211;solid PCMs are presented and then the structure&#8211;property relationship is discussed, followed by potential applications. Finally, an outlook discussion with momentous challenges and future directions is presented. Hopefully, this review will provide a guideline to the scientific community to develop high&#8208;performance solid&#8211;solid PCMs for advanced TES applications.

         <title>An Electric&#8208;Field&#8208;Reinforced Hydrophobic Cationic Sieve Lowers the Concentration Threshold of Water&#8208;In&#8208;Salt Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A small number of hydrophobic cations are introduced to appropriate concentration electrolyte (ACE) (13.8&#160;m). The added cations can form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses HER. Thus, the ALIBs with HCS&#8208;ACE can possess a compatible stable electrochemical window and achieve lower cost and better kinetic performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;concentration water&#8208;in&#8208;salt (WIS) electrolytes expand the stable electrochemical window of aqueous electrolytes, leading to the advent of high&#8208;voltage (above 2&#160;V) aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries (ALIBs). However, the high lithium salt concentration electrolytes of ALIBs result&#160;in their high cost and deteriorate kinetic performance. Therefore, it is challenging for ALIBs to explore aqueous electrolytes with appropriate concentration to balance the electrochemical window and kinetic performance as well as the cost. In contrast to maintaining high concentrations of aqueous electrolytes (&gt;20&#160;m), a small number of hydrophobic cations are introduced to a much lower electrolyte concentration (13.8&#160;m), and it is found that, compared with WIS electrolytes, ALIBs with these concentration&#8208;lowered electrolytes possess a compatible stable electrochemical window (3.23&#160;V) and achieve better kinetic performance. These findings originate from the added cations, which form an electric&#8208;field&#8208;reinforced hydrophobic cationic sieve (HCS) that blocks water away from the anode and suppresses the hydrogen evolution reaction. Meanwhile, the lower electrolyte concentration provides significant benefits to ALIBs, including lower cost, better rate capability (lower viscosity of 18&#160;cP and higher ionic conductivity of 22&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C), and improved low&#8208;temperature performance (liquidus temperature of &#8722;10.18&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Extracellular&#8208;Vesicle&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems for Enhanced Antitumor Therapies through Modulating the Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Extracellular&#8208;vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems show huge potential for improved antitumor immunotherapy. Five key steps during the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle of extracellular vesicles are reviewed; namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells.








Abstract
Although immunotherapy harnessing activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T&#8208;cell&#8208;mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on efficiency of triggering the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, namely, tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. Due to high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting, and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle (EV)&#8208;based drug delivery systems are widely used to amplify anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. This review summarizes various mechanisms related to affecting cancer&#8208;immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, preparation and application of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer&#8208;immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, opportunities and challenges of EV&#8208;based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications are briefly discussed.

         <title>Integrated Memory Devices Based on 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Confinement&#8208;Driven Inverse Domain Scaling in Polycrystalline ErMnO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polycrystalline ErMnO3 displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO3 or Pb(Zr,Ti)O3. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti&#8208;vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO3 and their interaction with elastic strain fields.








Abstract
The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order.

&lt;p&gt;Polycrystalline ErMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; displays an anomalous domain size/grain size scaling behavior in comparison to classical ferroelectric materials, such as BaTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or Pb(Zr,Ti)O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The fundamental difference is due to the formation of topologically protected vortex/anti-vortex pairs in polycrystalline ErMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and their interaction with elastic strain fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The research on topological phenomena in ferroelectric materials has revolutionized the way people understand polar order. Intriguing examples are polar skyrmions, vortex/anti-vortex structures, and ferroelectric incommensurabilties, which promote emergent physical properties ranging from electric-field-controllable chirality to negative capacitance effects. Here, the impact of topologically protected vortices on the domain formation in improper ferroelectric ErMnO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; polycrystals is studied, demonstrating inverted domain scaling behavior compared to classical ferroelectrics. It is observed that as the grain size increases, smaller domains are formed. Phase field simulations reveal that elastic strain fields drive the annihilation of vortex/anti-vortex pairs within the grains and individual vortices at the grain boundaries. The inversion of the domain scaling behavior has far-reaching implications, providing fundamentally new opportunities for topology-based domain engineering and the tuning of the electromechanical and dielectric performance of ferroelectrics in general.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomimetic Bacteriophage&#8208;Like Particles Formed from Probiotic Extracts and NO Donors for Eradicating Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitric oxide (NO) donors are combined with probiotic extracts to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles, which are used to construct a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) to meet different conditions. The DMAH can treat bacterial wounds through phage&#8208;like therapy in the dark. Meanwhile, DMAH can perform rapid disinfection through the synergistic photothermal/NO therapy under near&#8208;infrared light to cure infected wounds.








Abstract
Effectively clearing multidrug&#8208;resistant bacteria through nonantibiotic treatments is crucial for the recovery of infected tissues in favorable biological environments. Herein, a thermally responsive donor of cell&#8208;messenger nitric oxide (NO) is combined with extracts of food&#8208;grade Lactobacillus casei to form biomimetic phage&#8208;like microparticles with a tailspike structure. These particles can invade bacterial membranes and release NO to disrupt nitrogen and respiratory metabolisms, which initiates the programmed death of multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) for inducing lysis, like the bacterial virus. Experiments suggest that these microparticles can also weaken bacterial toxicity and provide favorable conditions for cell proliferation because of the continuously released NO. By encapsulating these microparticles into graphene&#8208;oxide&#8208;doped polymers, a dual&#8208;mode antibacterial hydrogel (DMAH) can be constructed. In vivo results reveal that the DMAH achieves a long&#8208;time sterilization of MRSA with 99.84 &#177; 0.13% antibacterial rate in the dark because of the phage&#8208;like performance of the biomimetic microparticles. In its other antibacterial mode, DMAH subjected to 20&#160;min of near&#8208;infrared irradiation release NO, which, together with the photothermal effect, synergistically damages bacterial cell membranes to achieve very fast disinfection (97.13 &#177; 0.41% bactericidal rate). This multifunctional hydrogel can also significantly accelerate wound healing due to the phage&#8208;like particles.

         <title>Readily Accessible Metallic Micro&#8208;Island Arrays for High&#8208;Performance Metal Oxide Thin&#8208;Film Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide (IGZO) TFT performance can be substantially enhanced by placing aluminum micro&#8208;island arrays (Al&#8208;MIAs) directly on top of the IGZO back channel. The MIA channel coverages/dimensions can be readily optimized by vapor depositing Al through tailored honeycomb cinnamate&#8208;cellulose film shadow masks, demonstrating the great versatility of this route to enhance metal oxide thin&#8208;film&#8208;transistor performance.








Abstract
Thin&#8208;film transistors using metal oxide semiconductors are essential in many unconventional electronic devices. Nevertheless, further advances will be necessary to broaden their technological appeal. Here, a new strategy is reported to achieve high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed metal oxide thin&#8208;film transistors (MOTFTs) by introducing a metallic micro&#8208;island array (M&#8208;MIA) on top of the MO back channel, where the MO is a&#8208;IGZO (amorphous indium&#8208;gallium&#8208;zinc&#8208;oxide). Here Al&#8208;MIAs are fabricated using honeycomb cinnamate cellulose films, created by a scalable breath&#8208;figure method, as a shadow mask. For IGZO TFTs, the electron mobility (&#181;e) increases from &#8776;3.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 to near 15.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for optimal Al&#8208;MIA dimension/coverage of 1.25 &#181;m/51%. The Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFT performance is superior to that of controls using compact/planar Al layers (Al&#8208;PL TFTs) and Au&#8208;MIAs with the same channel coverage. Kelvin probe force microscopy and technology computer&#8208;aided design simulations reveal that charge transfer occurs between the Al and the IGZO channel which is optimized for specific Al&#8208;MIA dimensions/surface channel coverages. Furthermore, such Al&#8208;MIA IGZO TFTs with a high&#8208;k fluoride&#8208;doped alumina dielectric exhibit a maximum &#181;e of &gt;50.2 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 . This is the first demonstration of a micro&#8208;structured MO semiconductor heterojunction with submicrometer resolution metallic arrays for enhanced transistor performance and broad applicability to other devices.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky&#8208;end&#8208;coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self&#8208;assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross&#8208;sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine&#8208;tuned for the self&#8208;assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.

         <title>Observation of H2 Evolution and Electrolyte Diffusion on MoS2 Monolayer by In Situ Liquid&#8208;Phase Transmission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM) facilitates real&#8208;time observation of the H2 evolution reaction (HER) on MoS2 monolayer. Time&#8208;series LPTEM shows sequential activation, H2 bubble formation, and electrolyte flow on different types of catalytic active sites. Directionality of H2 bubbling and competitive wetting between the bubbles and electrolyte on catalyst surface significantly affect the HER activity of the&#160;active sites.








Abstract
Unit&#8208;cell&#8208;thick MoS2 is a promising electrocatalyst for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) owing to its tunable catalytic activity, which is determined based on the energetics and molecular interactions of different types of HER active sites. Kinetic responses of MoS2 active sites, including the reaction onset, diffusion of the electrolyte and H2 bubbles, and continuation of these processes, are important factors affecting the catalytic activity of MoS2. Investigating these factors requires a direct real&#8208;time analysis of the HER occurring on spatially independent active sites. Herein, the H2 evolution and electrolyte diffusion on the surface of MoS2 are observed in real time by in situ electrochemical liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LPTEM). Time&#8208;dependent LPTEM observations reveal that different types of active sites are sequentially activated under the same conditions. Furthermore, the electrolyte flow to these sites is influenced by the reduction potential and site geometry, which affects the bubble detachment and overall HER activity of MoS2.

         <title>Organic Neuroelectronics: From Neural Interfaces to Neuroprosthetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic neuroelectronics have been researched to treat and diagnose neurological diseases. The organic materials provide large advantages for neural interfaces. Also, organic nervetronics provides efficient data processing by emulating functional behavior of neural systems. Recent progress in organic neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics, with aspects of materials, devices, and systems, and finally suggests future directions, is presented.








Abstract
Requirements and recent advances in research on organic neuroelectronics are outlined herein. Neuroelectronics such as neural interfaces and neuroprosthetics provide a promising approach to diagnose and treat neurological diseases. However, the current neural interfaces are rigid and not biocompatible, so they induce an immune response and deterioration of neural signal transmission. Organic materials are promising candidates for neural interfaces, due to their mechanical softness, excellent electrochemical properties, and biocompatibility. Also, organic nervetronics, which mimics functional properties of the biological nerve system, is being developed to overcome the limitations of the complex and energy&#8208;consuming conventional neuroprosthetics that limit long&#8208;term implantation and daily&#8208;life usage. Examples of organic materials for neural interfaces and neural signal recordings are reviewed, recent advances of organic nervetronics that use organic artificial synapses are highlighted, and then further requirements for neuroprosthetics are discussed. Finally, the future challenges that must be overcome to achieve ideal organic neuroelectronics for next&#8208;generation neuroprosthetics are discussed.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Unparalleled Strength and Supertoughness of Poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with Shape Memory and Clusterization&#8208;Triggered Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A molecularly engineered poly(urea&#8208;urethane) with unparalleled strength (&#8776;84.2&#160;MPa) and supertoughness (&#8776;322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3) that&#160;simultaneously features shape&#8208;memory effects, fatigue resistance, and clusterization&#8208;triggered emission properties,&#160;by regulating the reversible microphase&#8208;separation structure composed of the rigid unit and multiple hydrogen bonds and molecular weight of soft segment, is reported.








Abstract
To address the challenge of realizing multifunctional polymers simultaneously exhibiting high strength and high toughness through molecular engineering, ultrastrong and supertough shape&#8208;memory poly(urea&#8208;urethane) (PUU) is fabricated by regulating: i) the reversible cross&#8208;links composed of rigid units and multiple hydrogen bonds, and ii) the molecular weight of soft segments. The optimal material exhibits an unparalleled strength of 84.2&#160;MPa at a large elongation at a break of 925.6%, a superior toughness of 322.8&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and remarkable fatigue resistance without fracture. The repeated stretching of this material induces an irreversible deformation, which, however, can be rapidly recovered by heating. Moreover, all samples are capable of temporary shape fixation at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C (recovering the original shape at 30&#160;&#176;C) and exhibit blue fluorescence when excited at the optimum wavelength, which is ascribed to clusterization&#8208;triggered emission (CTE) due to the formation of microphase&#8208;separation structures. Thus, the adopted approach provides a solution to a long&#8208;standing problem and paves the way to the realization of intrinsically luminescent shape&#8208;memory materials exhibiting both ultrahigh strength and ultrahigh toughness.

         <title>Ru&#8208;Doping&#8208;Induced Spin Frustration and Enhancement of the Room&#8208;Temperature Anomalous Hall Effect in La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced anomalous Hall effect (AHE) in ferromagnetic La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 epitaxial films is explored, which circumvents the long&#8208;standing dilemma between large AHE and high Tc in transition&#8208;metal oxides. It is found that Ru doping can modulate the local exchange coupling and thus cause considerable spin frustration. The resultant spin frustration can dramatically enhance the skew&#8208;scattering and the extrinsic AHE.








Abstract
In transition&#8208;metal&#8208;oxide heterostructures, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) is a powerful tool for detecting the magnetic state and revealing intriguing interfacial magnetic orderings. However, achieving a larger AHE at room temperature in oxide heterostructures is still challenging due to the dilemma of mutually strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling and magnetic exchange interactions. Here, Ru&#8208;doping&#8208;enhanced AHE in La2/3Sr1/3Mn1&#8722;xRuxO3 epitaxial films is exploited. As the B&#8208;site Ru doping level increases up to 20%, the anomalous Hall resistivity at room temperature can be enhanced from n&#937; cm to &#181;&#937;&#160;cm scale. Ru doping leads to strong competition between the ferromagnetic double&#8208;exchange interaction and the antiferromagnetic superexchange interaction. The resultant spin frustration and spin&#8208;glass state facilitate a strong skew&#8208;scattering process, thus significantly enhancing the extrinsic AHE. The findings can pave a feasible approach for boosting the controllability and reliability of oxide&#8208;based spintronic devices.

         <title>Novel (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) Nonbonding Active Structures on Defective Carbon from Oxygen&#8208;Rich Coal Tar Pitch for Efficient HER and ORR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters in defective carbon supports derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch. The (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active sites exhibit excellent catalytic activity for the oxygen reduction reaction and hydrogen evolution reaction. The mass activity is far superior to commercial 20% Pt/C.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale utilization and coordination structure of Pt electrocatalyst is extremely crucial to decrease loading mass and maximize activity for hydrogen evolution reactions (HERs) and oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs). A novel atomic&#8208;scale (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure is designed and constructed by anchoring Pt single atoms and Co atomic clusters on the defective carbon derived from oxygen&#8208;rich coal tar pitch (CTP). The Pt loading mass is extremely low and only 0.56&#160;wt%. A new nonbonding interaction phenomenon between Pt&#8208;Ox and Co&#8208;Oy is found and confirmed based on X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations. Based on the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure, surface chemical field coupling with electrocatalysis for the HER and ORR is confirmed. It is found that the (Pt&#8208;Ox)&#8208;(Co&#8208;Oy) nonbonding active structure exhibits high mass activities of 64.4 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at an overpotential of 100&#160;mV) and 7.2 A cm&#8722;2 mgPt&#8722;1 (at 0.8&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) for the HER and ORR, respectively. The values are 6.5 and 11.6 times as much as those of commercial 20% Pt/C. The work provides innovative insight to design and understand efficient active sites of atomic&#8208;scale Pt on oxygen&#8208;rich CTP&#8208;derived carbon supports for electrocatalysis.

         <dc:description>
An activity&#8208;based photosensitizer for targeting histone deacetylases (HDACs) is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing its full potential for malignant tumor treatment.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has been a well&#8208;accepted clinical treatment for malignant tumors owing to its noninvasiveness and high spatiotemporal selectivity. However, the treatment outcome of current PDT applications is hindered by hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance of solid tumors. Recent studies have shown that inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) can induce cell ferroptosis, reverse hypoxia, and elevate oxidative status. Theoretically, the design and synthesis of activity&#8208;based photosensitizers that target HDACs can address the bottlenecks of PDT. Herein, the concept of an activity&#8208;based photosensitizer is presented for targeting HDACs, which is designed based on a quinoxalinone scaffold through a pharmacophore migration strategy. The developed activity&#8208;based photosensitizer can inhibit HDACs, and overcome hypoxia and intracellular oxidative resistance, realizing the full potential of photosensitizers for malignant tumor treatment. The molecular design strategy proposed in this project should provide theoretical guidance for the development of ideal photosensitizers for practical applications.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Graded Electrodes Mitigate the Mismatch between Mechanical Reliability and Energy Density for Foldable Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to mitigate the mismatch between mechanical reliability and energy density for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). The up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrode&#8208;based LIBs enable a remarkable figure of merit (FOM) value of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3, proving the brilliant comprehensive performance of flexible high&#8208;energy&#8208;density LIBs.








Abstract
Flexible lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) with high energy density are highly desirable for wearable electronics. However, difficult to achieve excellent flexibility and high energy density simultaneously via the current approaches for designing flexible LIBs. To mitigate the mismatch, mechano&#8208;graded electrodes with gradient&#8208;distributed maximum allowable strain are proposed to endow high&#8208;loading&#8208;mass slurry&#8208;coating electrodes with brilliant intrinsic flexibility without sacrificing energy density. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the up&#8208;graded LiNi1/3Mn1/3Co1/3O2 cathodes (&#8776;15&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;70&#160;&#181;m) and graphite anodes (&#8776;8&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, &#8776;105&#160;&#181;m) can tolerate an extremely low bending radius of 400 and 600&#160;&#181;m, respectively. Finite element analysis (FEA) reveals that, compared with conventionally homogeneous electrodes, the flexibility of the up&#8208;graded electrodes is enhanced by specifically strengthening the upper layer and avoiding crack initiation. Benefiting from this, the foldable pouch cell (required bending radius of &#8776;600&#160;&#181;m) successfully realizes a remarkable figure of merit (FOM, energy density vs bending radius) of 121.3 mWh cm&#8722;3. Moreover, the up&#8208;graded&#8208;electrodes&#8208;based pouch cells can deliver a stable power supply, even under various deformation modes, such as twisting, folding, and knotting. This work proposes new insights for harmonizing the mechanics and electrochemistry of energy storage devices to achieve high energy density under flexible extremes.

         <title>Synthetic Nanoarchitectonics of Functional Organic&#8211;Inorganic 2D Germanane Heterostructures via Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; synthetic approach is devised for covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich organic nanomaterials (i.e., carbon dots) onto commercially available 2D allyl germanane via the thiol&#8211;ene click reaction. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks that are inaccessible to the pristine 2D germanane counterpart.








Abstract
Succeeding graphene, 2D inorganic materials made of reactive van der Waals layers, like 2D germanane (2D&#8208;Ge) derivatives, have attracted great attention because their physicochemical characteristics can be entirely tuned by modulating the nature of the surface substituent. Although very interesting from a scientific point of view, almost all the reported works involving 2D&#8208;Ge derivatives are focused on computational studies. Herein, a first prototype of organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge heterostructure has been synthesized by covalently anchoring thiol&#8208;rich carbon dots (CD&#8211;SH) onto 2D allyl germanane (2D&#8208;aGe) via a simple and green &#8220;one&#8208;pot&#8221; click chemistry approach. Remarkably, the implanted characteristics of the carbon nanomaterial provide new physicochemical features to the resulting 0D/2D heterostructure, making possible its implementation in yet unexplored optoelectronic tasks&#8212;e.g., as a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) sensing system triggered by supramolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions&#8212;that are inaccessible for the pristine 2D&#8208;aGe counterpart. Consequently, this work builds a foundation toward the robust achievement of functional organic&#8211;inorganic 2D&#8208;Ge nanoarchitectonics through covalently assembling thiol&#8208;rich carbon nanoallotropes on commercially available 2D&#8208;aGe.

         <title>Magnetic Ordering in a High&#8208;Spin Donor&#8211;Acceptor Conjugated Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations within a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin&#8208;center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.








Abstract
The development of open&#8208;shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high&#8208;spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2&#8208;c;4,5&#8208;c&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long&#8208;range &#960;&#8208;correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability.

&lt;p&gt;The development of organic materials that magnetically order at room temperature remains a grand challenge central to integrating spin, magnetic, and quantum mechanical effects within emerging technologies. This work demonstrates that long-range &#960;-correlations within a high-spin conjugated polymer provide a viable path toward spin-center generation, robust intermolecular exchange interactions, anisotropic spin ordering at elevated temperatures, and high chemical stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The development of open-shell organic molecules that magnetically order at room temperature,which can be practically applied, remains a grand challenge in chemistry, physics, and materials science. Despite the exploration of vast chemical space, design paradigms for organic paramagnetic centers generally result in unpaired electron spins that are unstable or isotropic. Here, a high-spin conjugated polymer is demonstrated, which is composed of alternating cyclopentadithiophene and benzo[1,2-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;;4,5-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;&#8242;]bis[1,2,5]thiadiazole heterocycles, in which macromolecular structure and topology coalesce to promote the spin center generation and intermolecular exchange coupling. Electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy is consistent with spatially localized spins, while magnetic susceptibility measurements show clear anisotropic spin ordering and exchange interactions that persist at room temperature. The application of long-range &#960;-correlations for spin center generation promotes remarkable stability. This work offers a fundamentally new approach to the implementation of this long-sought-after physical phenomenon within organic materials and the integration of manifold properties within emerging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multiphase Morphology with Enhanced Carrier Lifetime via Quaternary Strategy Enables High&#8208;Efficiency, Thick&#8208;Film, and Large&#8208;Area Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A quaternary strategy is used to achieve desirable carrier behaviors and optimized multiphase morphology; thus, the device shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the device with &#8776;300&#160;nm&#8208;thick film shows a high efficiency of 17.55%, and the large&#8208;area devices (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) deliver encouraging PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, which are among the highest values reported so far.








Abstract
With the continuous breakthrough of the efficiency of&#160;organic photovoltaics (OPVs), their practical applications are on the agenda. However, the thickness tolerance and upscaling in recently reported high&#8208;efficiency devices remains challenging. In this work, the multiphase morphology and desired carrier behaviors are realized by utilizing a quaternary strategy. Notably, the exciton separation, carrier mobility, and carrier lifetime are enhanced significantly, the carrier recombination and the energy loss (Eloss) are reduced, thus beneficial for a higher short&#8208;circuit density (JSC), fill factor (FF), and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of the quaternary system. Moreover, the intermixing&#8208;phase size is optimized, which is favorable for constructing the thick&#8208;film and large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the device with a 110&#160;nm&#8208;thick active layer shows an outstanding power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.32% (certified 19.35%). Furthermore, the large&#8208;area (1.05 and 72.25 cm2) devices with 110&#160;nm thickness present PCEs of 18.25% and 12.20%, and the device with a 305&#160;nm&#8208;thick film (0.0473 cm2) delivers a PCE of 17.55%, which are among the highest values reported. The work demonstrates the potential of the quaternary strategy for large&#8208;area and thick&#8208;film OPVs and promotes the practical application of OPVs in the future.

         <title>Bimetallic Rechargeable Al/Zn Hybrid Aqueous Batteries Based on Al&#8211;Zn Alloys with Composite Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 5&#160;m Al(OTF)3&#160;+ 1&#160;m HOTF + 1&#160;m Zn(OTF)2 mixed electrolyte is designed in Al/Zn&#8211;MnO batteries. During charging&#8208;discharging, a topological transformation of MnO at the cathode avoids the collapse of the structure, the Al&#8211;Zn regional alloy at the anode avoids the corrosion of metal aluminum, and the intercalation of Zn ions makes it exhibit good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Aluminum is abundant and exhibits a high theoretical capacity and volumetric energy density. Additionally, the high safety of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries makes them strong candidates for large&#8208;scale energystorage systems. However, the frequent collapse of the cathode material and passive oxide film results in the difficult development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries. This work provides a novel battery system, namely, Al&#8211;Zn/Al(OTF)3+HOTF+Zn(OTF)2/AlxZnyMnO2&#183;nH2O, with a mixed electrolyte. The cathode applies MnO topology transformation to ensure that the cathode forms AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O. Topology transformation alters the structure of the cathode material so that Zn2+ can be intercalated into the AlxMnO2&#183;nH2O spinel structure to provide support for the material structure. Regarding the anode, Zn2+ in the electrolyte is deposited onto Al of the anode to produce a regional Al&#8211;Zn alloy. Zn2+ is reduced to Zn metal during discharging, which adds a platform for secondary discharge beneficial for battery capacity enhancement. This system can provide a 1.6&#160;V discharge platform, while the first cycle discharge can reach 554 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1, thereby maintaining a high capacity of 313 mAh&#160;g&#8208;1 after 100 cycles. This study provides a new idea for the further development of aqueous aluminum&#8208;ion batteries (AAIBs).

         <title>Boosting Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Activity via Atom&#8208;Stepped Interfaces Architected with Kinetic Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy yet stable interface architecture with abundant catalytically active atom steps can be facilely fabricated by utilizing the kinetic frustration effect in glass&#8208;forming alloys during rapid solidification. These atomic steps can be well stabilized due to the confinement effect imposed by the disordered glassy matrix and provide fast&#8208;catalytic kinetics for oxygen&#8208;evolving reaction.








Abstract
A highly active interface is extremely critical for the catalytic efficiency of an electrocatalyst; however, facilely tailoring its atomic packing characteristics remains challenging. Herein, a simple yet effective strategy is reported to obtain copious high&#8208;energy atomic steps at the interface via controlling the solidification behavior of glass&#8208;forming metallic liquids. By adjusting the chemical composition and cooling rate, highly faceted FeNi3 nanocrystals are in&#160;situ formed in an Fe&#63743;Ni&#63743;B metallic glass (MG) matrix, leading to the creation of order/disorder interfaces. Benefiting from the catalytically active and stable atomic steps at the jagged interfaces, the resultant free&#8208;standing FeNi3 nanocrystal/MG composite exhibits a low oxygen&#8208;evolving overpotential of 214&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a small Tafel slope of 32.4&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1, and good stability in alkaline media, outperforming most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. This approach is based on the manipulation of nucleation and crystal growth of the solid&#8208;solution nanophases (e.g., FeNi3) in glass&#8208;forming liquids, so that the highly stepped interface architecture can be obtained due to the kinetic frustration effect in MGs upon undercooling. It is envisaged that the atomic&#8208;level stepped interface engineering via the physical metallurgy method can be easily extended to other MG systems, providing a new and generic paradigm for designing efficient yet cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts.

         <title>Modular Nanostructures Facilitate Low Thermal Conductivity and Ultra&#8208;High Thermoelectric Performance in n&#8208;Type SnSe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Formation of 2D modular intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n nanostructures with periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the bulk SnSe matrix significantly scatters the phonons and reduces the lattice thermal conductivity&#160; drastically to an ultra&#8208;low value of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1. Thereby, a record high thermoelectric figure of merit of 2.0 at &#8776;800 K is achieved in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe.








Abstract
Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (zT) of p&#8208;type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &gt;2.5, zT of n&#8208;type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high zT of 2.0 in n&#8208;type polycrystalline SnSe0.92&#160;+ x mol% MoCl5 (x&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of n&#8208;type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano&#8208;heterostructures in SnSe matrix. Modular nanostructures of layered intergrowth [(SnSe)1.05]m(MoSe2)n like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra&#8208;low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;lat) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 798 K in SnSe0.92&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl5. The 2D layered modular intergrowth compound resembles the nano&#8208;heterostructure and their periodicity of 1.2&#8211;2.6&#160;nm in the SnSe matrix matches the phonon mean free path of SnSe, thereby blocking the heat carrying phonons, which result in low &#954;lat and ultra&#8208;high thermoelectric performance in n&#8208;type SnSe.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single crystals of SnSe have gained considerable attention in thermoelectrics due to their unprecedented thermoelectric performance. However, polycrystalline SnSe is more favorable for practical applications due to its facile chemical synthesis procedure, processability, and scalability. Though the thermoelectric figure of merit (&lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt;) of &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-type bulk SnSe polycrystals has reached &amp;gt;2.5, &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type counterpart is still lower and lies around &#8776;1.5. Herein, record high &lt;i&gt;zT&lt;/i&gt; of 2.0 in &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type polycrystalline SnSe&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+ &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; mol% MoCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; (&lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt;&#160;= 0&#8211;3) samples is reported, when measured parallel to the spark plasma sintering pressing direction due to the simultaneous optimization of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;-type carrier concentration and enhanced phonon scattering by incorporating modular nano-heterostructures in SnSe matrix.

   &lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; like compounds embedded in SnSe matrix scatters the phonons significantly leading to an ultra-low lattice thermal conductivity (&#954;&lt;sub&gt;lat&lt;/sub&gt;) of &#8776;0.26&#160;W m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 798 K in SnSe&lt;sub&gt;0.92&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;+ 3 mol% MoCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.

Abstract
Here, the authors report a highly efficient integrated ideal&#8208;bandgap perovskite/bulk&#8208;heterojunction solar cell (IPBSC) with an inverted architecture, featuring a near infrared (NIR) polymer DTBTI&#8208;based bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) layer atop guanidinium bromide (GABr)&#8208;modified FA0.7MA0.3Pb0.7Sn0.3I3 perovskite film as the photoactive layer. The IPBSC shows cascade&#8208;like energy level alignment between the charge&#8208;extractionlayer/perovskite/BHJ and efficient passivation effect of BHJ on perovskite. Thanks to the well&#8208;matched energy level alignment and high&#8208;quality ideal bandgap&#8208;based perovskite film, an efficient charge transfer occurs between the charge&#8208;extraction&#8208;layer/perovskite/BHJ. Moreover, the NIR polymer DTBTI on the perovskite film leads to an improved NIR light response for the IPBSC. In addition, the O, S and N atoms in the DTBTI polymer yield a strong interaction with perovskite, which is conducive to reducing the defects of the perovskite and suppressing charge recombination. As a result, the solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.27% (certificated value at 23.4% with 0.283&#8208;volt voltage loss), currently the recorded efficiency for both IPBSCs and Pb&#8208;Sn alloyed PSCs, and which is over the highest efficiency of perovskite&#8211;organic tandem solar cell. Moreover, the thermal, humidity and long&#8208;term operational stabilities of the IPBSCs are also significantly improved compared with the control PSCs.

         <title>Tropocollagen&#8208;Inspired Hierarchical Spiral Structure of Organic Fibers in Epoxy Bulk for 3D High Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully organic yet 3D thermoconductive bulk material is fabricated via weaving the hierarchical spiral poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) fibers into an epoxy matrix. Significantly, not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral, and weaving structure of poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole), but also the bridging noncrystalline chains enable spatially phonon transport. This paves the way for fully organic materials in the fields of advanced thermal management.








Abstract
Polymers are usually considered thermal insulators; however, significant enhancements in thermal conductivity (k) have been observed in oriented fibers and films. Despite being advantageous in real&#8208;world applications, extending the linear thermal&#8208;transport advantage of polymers into the 3D space in bulk materials is still limited due to the spatially interfacial phonon&#8208;conduction barriers. Herein, inspired by the structure of tropocollagen, it is discovered that weaving hierarchically arranged poly(p&#8208;phenylene benzobisoxazole) (PBO) fibers with a spiral configuration into an epoxy matrix can yield a 3D continuous thermal pathway. This achieves both a through&#8208;plane k of 10.85&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1 and an in&#8208;plane k of 7.15&#160;W&#8201;m&#8722;1&#8201;K&#8722;1. Theoretical molecular simulations in combination with classical nonlinear modeling attribute the above spatially thermally conductive achievement to not only the hierarchical molecular, spiral and weaving structure of PBO, but also the noncrystalline chains that carry overlapping phonon density of states, thus thermally bridging adjacent high&#8208;k crystals in the PBO fiber. Consequently, the interfacial thermal resistance among high&#8208;k PBO crystals is suppressed to be on the order of 10&#8722;10&#8201;m2&#8201;K&#8201;W&#8722;1 in both the through&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane directions. Other advantages include being lightweight, mechanically strong, flexible, and non&#8208;combustible. This material creates opportunities for organic polymers in high&#8208;performance thermal management applications.

         <title>Wireless Miniature Magnetic Phase&#8208;Change Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed wireless miniature phase&#8208;change soft actuators exhibit enhancing output force and work capacity, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. This output performance enables the actuator to have the ability for angioplasty applications, locomotion in granular media, and programmable magnetic deformation, demonstrating its potential in medical and other robotic applications.








Abstract
Wireless miniature soft actuators are promising for various potential high&#8208;impact applications in medical, robotic grippers, and artificial muscles. However, these miniature soft actuators are currently constrained by a small output force and low work capacity. To address such challenges, a miniature magnetic phase&#8208;change soft composite actuator is reported. This soft actuator exhibits an expanding deformation and enables up to a 70&#160;N output force and 175.2&#160;J&#160;g&#8722;1 work capacity under remote magnetic radio frequency heating, which are 106&#8211;107 times that of traditional magnetic soft actuators. To demonstrate its capabilities, a wireless soft robotic device is first designed that can withstand 0.24&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 fluid flows in an artery phantom. By integrating it with a thermally&#8208;responsive shape&#8208;memory polymer and bistable metamaterial sleeve, a wireless reversible bistable stent is designed toward future potential angioplasty applications. Moreover, it can additionally locomote inside and jump out of granular media. At last, the phase&#8208;change actuator can realize programmable bending deformations when a specifically designed magnetization profile is encoded, enhancing its shape&#8208;programming capability. Such a miniature soft actuator provides an approach to enhance the mechanical output and versatility of magnetic soft robots and devices, extending their medical and other potential applications.

         <title>Balanced Interfacial Ion Concentration and Migration Steric Hindrance Promoting High&#8208;Efficiency Deposition/Dissolution Battery Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The important influence of interfacial ion effect on aqueous zinc&#8211;manganese batteries is proposed. The interfacial ion concentration and steric hindrance in the electric double layer are comprehensively balanced from the perspective of thermodynamics and kinetics, respectively, to achieve both high specific capacity and long cycle stability simultaneously.








Abstract
The solid&#8211;liquid transition reaction lays the foundation of electrochemical energy storage systems with high capacity, but realizing high efficiency remains a challenge. Herein, in terms of thermodynamics and dynamics, this work demonstrates the significant role of both interfacial H+ concentration and Mn2+ migration steric hindrance for the high&#8208;efficiency deposition/dissolution chemistry of zinc&#8211;manganese batteries. Specially, the introduction of formate anions can buffer the generated interfacial H+ to stabilize interfacial potential according to the Nernst equation, which stimulates high capacity. Compared with acetate and propionate anions, the formate anion&#160;also provides high adsorption density on the cathode surface to shield the electrostatic repulsion due to the small spatial hindrance. Particularly for the solvated Mn2+, the formate&#8208;anion&#8208;induced lower energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step during the step&#8208;by&#8208;step desolvation process results in lower polarization and higher electrochemical reversibility. In&#160;situ tests and theoretical calculations verify that the electrolyte with formate anions achieve a good balance between ion concentration and ion&#8208;migration steric hindrance. It exhibits both the high energy density of 531.26&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8208;1&#160;and long cycle life of more than 300&#160;cycles without obvious decay.

Abstract
The development of eco&#8208;friendly, ultralow&#8208;power and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process electronics is facing dominant challenges in emerging off&#8208;the&#8208;grid applications, such as the Internet of Things (IoTs) and extreme environment explorations at the south/north&#160;pole, in the deep sea, and in outer space. Eco&#8208;friendly, biodegradable, lightweight, and flexible paper&#8208;based electronics can provide many new possibilities for next&#8208;generation devices and circuits. Here, enhancement&#8208;mode (E&#8208;mode, remaining off state at zero gate voltages) carbon nanotube (CNT) complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) thin&#8208;film transistors (TFTs) are built on paper substrates through a printing&#8208;based process. Benefitting from the CMOS circuit style and E&#8208;mode transistors, the fabricated CMOS inverters exhibit high voltage gains (more than 11) and noise margins (up to 75% 1/2 VDD at VDD of 0.4&#160;V), and rail&#8208;to&#8208;rail operation down to a VDD as low as 0.2&#160;V and record low power dissipation as low as 0.0124 pW &#956;m&#8722;1. Furthermore, the transistors and integrated circuits (ICs) show an excellent radiation tolerance of a total ionizing dose (TID) exceeding 2 Mrad with a high dose rate of 365&#8201;rad&#8201;s&#8722;1. The record power consumption and outstanding radiation tolerance behavior achieved in paper&#8208;based and easy&#8208;to&#8208;process CNT electronics are attractive for emerging energy&#8208;saving and environmentally friendly ICs in harsh environment (such as outer&#8208;space) applications.

         <title>Role of Moisture and Oxygen in Defect Management and Orderly Oxidation Boosting Carbon&#8208;Based CsPbI2Br Solar Cells to a New Record Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Orderly oxidation of CsPbI2Br film in moist air leads to more efficient defect passivation in film by grain boundary oxidation, and higher hole extraction efficiency in device via the energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and oxidation product CsPbIBr2. The champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.








Abstract
Large energy loss (Eloss) caused&#160;by defect&#8208;assisted recombination makes the photovoltaic performance of carbon&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (C&#8208;PSCs) inferior to that of metal&#8208;electrode ones. Herein, the influence of environmental factors (moisture and oxygen) on defect management during re&#8208;annealing process of CsPbI2Br crystalline films is systematically studied. Density functional theory and experimental results indicate that moisture in the air can significantly reduce the oxidation kinetics of crystalline films, resulting in orderly oxidation. Concomitantly, the oxidation decomposition products PbO and CsPbIBr2 are enriched at grain boundaries, passivating surface defects efficiently. Simultaneously, energy band coupling between CsPbI2Br and CsPbIBr2 improves the hole extraction efficiency. The photovoltage of corresponding C&#8208;PSCs is increased from 1.05 to 1.32&#160;V, indicating a reduced Eloss derived from orderly oxidation strategy. Correspondingly, the champion cell achieves an efficiency of 15.27%, and a certified efficiency of 14.7%, which is a new record efficiency for CsPbI2Br C&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Engineered Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicles as Controllable Two&#8208;Way Adaptors to Activate Macrophage Phagocytosis for Improved Tumor Immunotherapy</title>

An outer membrane vesicle (OMV)&#8208;based controllable PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb remarkedly increase the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activate tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM) phagocytosis of tumor cells via inducing M1 polarization and blocking &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.








Abstract
The most immune cells infiltrating tumor microenvironment (TME), tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) closely resemble immunosuppressive M2&#8208;polarized macrophages. Moreover, tumor cells exhibit high expression of CD47 &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal, which obstructs macrophage phagocytosis. The precise and efficient activation of TAMs is a promising approach to tumor immunotherapy; however, re&#8208;education of macrophages remains a challenge. Bacteria&#8208;derived outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are highly immunogenic nanovesicles that can robustly stimulate macrophages. Here, an OMV&#8208;based controllable two&#8208;way adaptor is reported, in which a CD47 nanobody (CD47nb) is fused onto OMV surface (OMV&#8208;CD47nb), with the outer surface coated with a polyethylene glycol (PEG) layer containing diselenide bonds (PEG/Se) to form PEG/Se@OMV&#8208;CD47nb. The PEG/Se layer modification not only mitigates the immunogenicity of OMV&#8208;CD47nb, thereby remarkedly increasing the dose that can be administered safely through intravenous injection, but also equips the formulation with radiation&#8208;triggered controlled release of OMV&#8208;CD47nb. Application of radiation to tumors in mice injected with the nanoformulation results in remodeling of TME. As two&#8208;way adaptors, OMV&#8208;CD47nb activates TAM phagocytosis of tumor cells via multiple pathways, including induction of M1 polarization and blockade of &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal. Moreover, this activation of TAMs results in the stimulation of T cell&#8208;mediated antitumor immunity through effective antigen presentation.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Homogeneous Ru&#63743;Cu Alloy Nanoparticles for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An atomic&#8208;scale homogeneous alloy of immiscible metals is first implemented in electrocatalytic nitrogen reduction (NRR) by a unique carbothermal shock method. Atomic&#8208;scale mixing of ruthenium and copper facilitates pivotal reaction steps in NRR, showing high selectivity and formation rate to ammonia. This paves the way for developing numerous potential homogeneous alloys of immiscible metal combinations for future efficient NRR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is the most widely used metal as an electrocatalyst for nitrogen (N2) reduction reaction (NRR) because of the relatively high N2 adsorption strength for successive reaction. Recently, it has been well reported that the homogeneous Ru&#8208;based metal alloys such as Ru&#63743;Rh, Ru&#63743;Pt, and Ru&#63743;Co significantly enhance the selectivity and formation rate of ammonia (NH3). However, the metal combinations for NRR have been limited to several miscible combinations of metals with Ru, although various immiscible combinations have immense potential to show high NRR performance. In this study, an immiscible combination of Ru and copper (Cu) is first utilized, and homogeneous alloy nanoparticles (Ru&#63743;Cu NPs) are fabricated by the carbothermal shock method. The Ru&#63743;Cu homogeneous NP alloys on cellulose/carbon nanotube sponge exhibit the highest selectivity and NH3 formation rate of &#8776;31% and &#8722;73&#160;&#956;mol h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2, respectively. These are the highest values of the selectivity and NH3 formation rates among existing Ru&#8208;based alloy metal combinations.

         <title>Universal Hopping Motion Protected by Structural Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Universal scaling behavior of hopping motion determined by the shape of the interface and its topology is discovered through the current&#8208;driven motion of magnetic skyrmions. This provides insights for implementing the skyrmionic devices and, for understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface, which appears in a wide range of physical systems.








Abstract
A scaling law elucidates the universality in nature, presiding over many physical phenomena which seem unrelated. Thus, exploring the universality class of scaling law in a particular system enlightens its physical nature in relevance to other systems and sometimes unearths an unprecedented new dynamic phase. Here, the dynamics of weakly driven magnetic skyrmions are investigated, and its scaling law is compared with the motion of a magnetic domain wall (DW) creep. This study finds that the skyrmion does not follow the scaling law of the DW creep in 2D space but instead shows a hopping behavior similar to that of the particle&#8208;like DW in 1D confinement. In addition, the hopping law satisfies even when a topological charge of the skyrmion is removed. Therefore, the distinct scaling behavior between the magnetic skyrmion and the DW stems from a general principle beyond the topological charge. This study demonstrates that the hopping behavior of skyrmions originates from the bottleneck process induced by DW segments with diverging collective lengths, which is inevitable in any closed&#8208;shape spin structure in 2D. This work reveals that the structural topology of magnetic texture determines the universality class of its weakly driven motion, which is distinguished from the universality class of magnetic DW creep.

         <title>Large Room Temperature Anomalous Transverse Thermoelectric Effect in Kagome Antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 exhibits a maximum transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776; 2.4 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at 200 K. More importantly, a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of &#8776; 2 &#181;V&#160;K&#8722;1 at 300 K is observed, which is the highest value for any antiferromagnetic material. This large ANE value can be attributed to the presence of a Dirac point and flat band close to the Fermi level with intrinsic Berry curvature.








Abstract
Kagome magnets possess several novel nontrivial topological features owing to the strong correlation between topology and magnetism that extends to their applications in the field of thermoelectricity. Conventional thermoelectric (TE) devices use the Seebeck effect to convert heat into electrical energy. In contrast, transverse thermoelectric devices based on the Nernst effect are attracting recent attention due to their unique transverse geometry, which uses a single material to eliminate the need for a multitude of electrical connections compared to conventional TE devices. Here, a large anomalous transverse thermoelectric effect of &#8776;2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in a kagome antiferromagnet YMn6Sn6 single crystal is obtained. The obtained value is larger than that of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials and comparable with ferromagnetic systems. The large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) can be attributed to the net Berry curvature near the Fermi level. Furthermore, the ANE of the AFM YMn6Sn6 exceeds the magnetization scaling relationship of conventional ferromagnets. The results clearly illustrate that AFM material YMn6Sn6 is an ideal topological material for room&#8208;temperature transverse thermoelectric applications.

         <title>A Simple Preheating&#8208;Pyrolysis Strategy Leading to Superior Oxygen Reduction Reaction Activity in Fe&#8208;N/Carbon Black</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple pyrolysis strategy by mixing FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline, and carbon black can impart high oxygen reduction reaction activities and stabilities to commercial carbon black; the catalyst obtained by this simple method has a stronger catalytic activity than metal&#8211;organic frameworks derived carbon, metal&#8208;loaded graphene, and single&#8208;atom sites catalysts. This approach can also be extended to other nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands.








Abstract
Maintaining the high catalytic activity of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) while reducing costs is a long&#8208;standing effort to promote the application of polymer electrolyte fuel cells. Here, the binding of nitrogen&#8208;containing ligands and carbon black is enhanced by controlling the pyrolysis conditions of a FeSO4, 1,10&#8208;phenanthroline (phen), carbon black mixture, which significantly improves the ORR catalytic activity of the pyrolysis products. Preheating is proposed as a process improvement method using a heat treatment at a temperature between the melting and boiling points of phen before high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis, which achieves an effective combination of phen and carbon black, and enhances the interaction between phen and ferrous ions. This method substantially increases the number of FeNx active centers in the pyrolysis product, resulting in an impressive Fe&#8208;N/C catalyst with half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2) up to 0.93&#160;V and a diffusion&#8208;limited current density (jL) of 5.9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8211;2 and no obvious decay after 20&#160;000 cyclic voltammetry cycles in 0.1&#160;m&#160;KOH, which are all among the best&#8208;reported data known to date. The interaction between the ratio of Fe/phen and the pyrolysis conditions is also investigated. Under the right conditions, cheap raw materials can also generate highly catalytically active sites.

         <title>&#8220;Red Carbon&#8221;: A Rediscovered Covalent Crystalline Semiconductor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon suboxide is a molecule spontaneously polymerizing into conjugated ladder oligomers composed of carbon and oxygen atoms only, and named &#8220;red carbon.&#8221; Herein, this partially forgotten chemistry is brought back to the attention of the community of covalent semiconductors. As&#8208;synthesized red carbon generates superoxide species upon light irradiation, acting as an efficient photocatalyst, with performance superior to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art carbon nitrides.








Abstract
Carbon suboxide (C3O2) is a unique molecule able to polymerize spontaneously into highly conjugated light&#8208;absorbing structures at temperatures as low as 0&#160;&#176;C. Despite obvious advantages, little is known about the nature and the functional properties of this carbonaceous material. In this work, the aim is to bring &#8220;red carbon,&#8221; a forgotten polymeric semiconductor, back to the community's attention. A solution polymerization process is adapted to simplify the synthesis and control the structure. This allows one to obtain this crystalline covalent material at low temperatures. Both spectroscopic and elemental analyses support the chemical structure represented as conjugated ladder polypyrone ribbons. Density functional theory calculations suggest a crystalline structure of AB stacks of polypyrone ribbons and identify the material as a direct bandgap semiconductor with a medium bandgap that is further confirmed by optical analysis. The material shows promising photocatalytic performance using blue light. Moreover, the simple condensation&#8211;aromatization route described here allows the straightforward fabrication of conjugated ladder polymers and can be inspiring for the synthesis of carbonaceous materials at low temperatures in general.

         <title>An Irradiance&#8208;Adaptable Near&#8208;Infrared Vertical Heterojunction Phototransistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A near&#8208;infrared phototransistor using the graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel is fabricated. The device demonstrates an intense gate voltage&#8208;dependent photoresponse. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.








Abstract
Bioinspired artificial visual perception devices with the optical environment&#8208;adaptable function have attracted significant attention for their promising potential in applications like robotics and machine vision. In this regard, a photodetector with in&#8208;sensor adaptability is longed for in terms of complexity, efficiency, and cost. Here, a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with a benign light irradiance&#8208;adaptability is presented. The phototransistor uses a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. Compared with ordinary lead sulfide quantum dots&#8208;decorated graphene phototransistors, the present device demonstrates a faster photoresponse speed and an abnormal transfer characteristic. The latter characteristic is induced by the gate voltage&#8208;tunable Fermi level in the heterojunction and the abundant electron trap states in the quantum dot film, which jointly results in an intense dependence of the photoresponse on the gate voltage. The dynamic trapping and de&#8208;trapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhibition or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively. By providing an irradiance&#8208;adaptable photodetector with a spectral response beyond visible light, this work should inspire future research on artificial environment&#8208;adaptable perception devices.

         <title>An Electret&#8208;Powered Skin&#8208;Attachable Auditory Sensor that Functions in Harsh Acoustic Environments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electret&#8208;powered skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor operating without a bulky battery is presented. The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragm array with elastomer nanodroplets facilitates high sensing performance and clear voice detection in a harsh acoustic environment. The acoustic sensor shows a strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications.








Abstract
Auditory sensors have shortcomings with respect to not only personalization with wearability and portability but also detecting a human voice clearly in a noisy environment or when a mask covers the mouth. In this work, an electret&#8208;powered and hole&#8208;patterned polymer diaphragm is exploited into a skin&#8208;attachable auditory sensor. The optimized charged electret diaphragm induces a voltage bias of &gt;400&#160;V against the counter electrode, which reduces the necessity of a bulky power source and enables the capacitive sensor to show high sensitivity (2.2&#160;V&#160;Pa&#8722;1) with incorporation of an elastomer nanodroplet seismic mass. The sophisticated capacitive structure with low mechanical damping enables a flat frequency response (80&#8211;3000&#160;Hz) and good linearity (50&#8211;80&#160;dBSPL). The hole&#8208;patterned electret diaphragms help the skin&#8208;attachable sensor detect only neck&#8208;skin vibration rather than dynamic air pressure, enabling a person's voice to be detected in a harsh acoustic environment. The sensor operates reliably even in the presence of surrounding noise and when the user is wearing a gas mask. Therefore, the sensor shows strong potential of a communication tool for disaster response and quarantine activities, and of diagnosis tool for vocal healthcare applications such as cough monitoring and voice dosimetry.

         <title>Direct Exciton Harvesting from a Bound Triplet Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficacy of using bound triplet pairs directly for electrical and chemical work is demonstrated. In support of this it is shown that triplet pairs can be directly harvested and&#160;that significant benefit in the achievable quantum efficiency is achieved by utilizing the triplet pair before annihilation processes occur.








Abstract
Singlet fission is commonly defined as the generation of two triplet excitons from a single absorbed photon. However, ambiguities within this definition arise due to the complexity of the various double triplet states that exist in SF chromophores and the corresponding interconversion processes. To clarify this process, singlet fission is frequently depicted as sequential two&#8208;step conversion in which a singlet exciton decays into a bound triplet&#8208;pair biexciton state that dissociates into two &#8220;free&#8221; triplet excitons. However, this model discounts the potential for direct harvesting from the coupled biexciton state. Here, it is demonstrated that individual triplet excitons can be extracted directly from a bound triplet pair. It is demonstrated that due to the requirement for geminate triplet&#8211;triplet annihilation in intramolecular singlet fission compounds, unique spectral and kinetic signatures can be used to quantify triplet&#8208;pair harvesting yields. An internal quantum efficiency for triplet exciton transfer from the triplet pair of &gt;50%, limited only by the solubility of the compounds is achieved. The harvesting process is not dependent on the net multiplicity of the triplet&#8208;pair state, suggesting that an explicit, independent dissociation step is not a requirement for using triplet pairs to do chemical or electrical work.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Scale Observation of Grain Boundary Dominated Unsynchronized Phase Transition in Polycrystalline Cu2Se</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The second&#8208;order phase transition behavior of the grains in the polycrystalline system is highly dependent on the surrounding grain boundaries environment. Atomic&#8208;scale observations show that the dominating effect of different grain boundaries leads to coexistence of high&#8208; and low&#8208;temperature phases of Cu2Se in one grain.








Abstract
Phase transition is a physical phenomenon that attracts great interest of researchers. Although the theory of second&#8208;order phase transitions is well&#8208;established, their atomic&#8208;scale dynamics in polycrystalline materials remains elusive. In this work, second&#8208;order phase transitions in polycrystalline Cu2Se at the transition temperature are directly observed by in situ aberration&#8208;corrected transmission electron microscopy. Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu2Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu2Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic&#8208;scale understanding of second&#8208;order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.

Phase transitions in microcrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se start at the grain boundaries and extend inside the grains. This phenomenon is more pronounced in nanosized grains. Analysis of phase transitions in nanocrystalline Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se with different grain boundaries demonstrates that grain boundary energy dominates unsynchronized phase transition behavior. This suggests that the energy of grain boundaries is the key factor influencing the energetic barrier for initiation of phase transition. The findings advance atomic-scale understanding of second-order phase transitions, which is crucial for the control of this process in polycrystalline materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Formation CoO Nanodots Catalyst in Co(TFSI)2&#8208;Modified Electrolyte for High Efficient Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A CoO nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive for Li&#8208;O2 batteries. The highly dispersed CoO NDs integrate both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst, which can make a contribution to promoting the formation and decomposition of Li2O2, achieving a superior cyclability.








Abstract
The major challenges for Li&#8208;O2 batteries are sluggish reaction kinetics and large overpotentials due to the cathode passivation resulting from insulative and insoluble Li2O2. Here, a novel nanodot (ND)&#8208;modified electrolyte is designed by employing cobalt bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide (Co(TFSI)2) as an electrolyte additive. The Co(TFSI)2 additive can react with discharge intermediate LiO2 and product Li2O2 to form CoO NDs. The generated CoO NDs are well dispersed in electrolyte, which integrates both the high catalytic activity of solid catalyst and the good wettability of soluble catalyst. Under the catalytis of CoO NDs, Li2O2 is produced and deposits on the cathode together with them. At the recharge process, these well dispersed CoO NDs help to decompose solid Li2O2 at a lower overpotential. The Li&#8208;O2 cells with Co(TFSI)2 exhibit a long cycle life of 200 cycles at a current density of 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 under a cutoff capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1, as well as a superior reversibility associated with the Li2O2 formation and decomposition. The study is expected to broaden the range of electrolyte additives and provide a new view to developing highly dispersed NDs&#8208;based catalysts for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.

         <title>Unbreakable Hydrogels with Self&#8208;Recoverable 10&#8239;200% Stretchability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unbreakable networks are simply constructed in hydrogels via copolymerization of divinyl benzene micellar with acrylamide. The network provides both dynamic hydrophobic association for recoverable small deformations and homogeneous crosslinking for reversible alignment of polymer chains to resist ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit self&#8208;recoverable 102 times stretchability, and superior resistance of fracture and fatigue.








Abstract
Design of tough hydrogels maintaining structural integrity under multivariable mechanical loads remains hugely challenging because the anticipated characteristics such as stretchability, strength, toughness, and fracture resistance can hardly be compatible. Herein, a simple but robust hydrogel network formed by copolymerization of divinyl benzene with acrylamide in micellar solutions for ultra&#8208;high fracture resistance and self&#8208;recoverable stretchability is proposed. The network provides dynamic association of hydrophobic domains and homogeneous crosslinking of hydrophilic chains, which shows step&#8208;by&#8208;step deformation process. The dynamic associations allow recoverable small deformations, then the homogeneous crosslinking ensures reversible unfolding and alignment of polymer chains to self&#8208;strengthen for ultra&#8208;large deformations without crack propagations. The resultant hydrogels exhibit comprehensive unbreakable feature with self&#8208;recoverable ultra&#8208;high stretchability (100% recovery from 10&#8239;200% strain), superior fracture resistance (toughness &gt; 26&#160;kJ m&#8722;2), and anticrack propagation and fatigue (fatigue threshold: &#8776;2.5&#160;kJ m&#8722;2). Even the prenotched hydrogels can undergo tens cyclic loads at 10&#8239;200% strain and thousands cyclic loads at 200% strain without noticeable changes in mechanical performance. The robust network prepared from homogeneous hydrophobic crosslinking provides a facile approach and a new mechanism to explore tough hydrogels with superior antifracture and extreme self&#8208;recoverable deformability for diverse applications.

         <title>In Situ Silver&#8208;Based Electrochemical Oncolytic Bioreactor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor has been established to unlock anti&#8208;tumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly&#8208;efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating reactive oxygen species production, wherein reduced graphene oxide featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than graphene oxide allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with VitC&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.








Abstract
In this study, it is shown for the first time that a reduced graphene oxide (rGO) carrier has a 20&#8208;fold higher catalysis rate than graphene oxide in Ag+ reduction. Based on this, a tumor microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) which switched Ag+ prodrugs into in situ therapeutic silver nanoparticles with and above 95% transition rate is constructed to inhibit the growths of various tumors. In this SEOB&#8208;enabled intratumoral nanosynthetic medicine, intratumoral H2O2 and rGO act as the reductant and the catalyst, respectively. Chelation of aptamers to the SEOB&#8208;unlocked prodrugs increases the production of silver nanoparticles in tumor cells, especially in the presence of Vitamin C, which is broken down in tumor cells to supply massive amounts of H2O2. Consequently, apoptosis and pyroptosis are induced to cooperatively contribute to the considerably&#8208;elevated anti&#8208;tumor effects on subcutaneous HepG2 and A549 tumors and orthotopic implanted HepG2 tumors in livers of nude mice. The specific aptamer targeting and intratumoral silver nanoparticle production guarantee excellent biosafety since it fails to elicit tissue damages in monkeys, which greatly increases the clinical translation potential of the SEOB system.

         <title>Fully Textured, Production&#8208;Line Compatible Monolithic Perovskite/Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 29% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>

An ultrathin hybrid hole transporting layer&#160;employing NiOx/[2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid enables complete and uniform coverage on fully textured indium tin oxide (ITO)/silicon surface with pyramid structures of 2&#8211;5&#160;&#181;m sizes. As a result of the depleted shunt pathways between ITO and perovskite top cell, a certified record efficiency&#8212;28.84%&#8212;is achieved on perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells with fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible bottom silicon wafers.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells are promising avenues for achieving high&#8208;performance photovoltaics with low costs. However, the highest certified efficiency of perovskite/silicon tandem devices based on economically matured silicon heterojunction technology (SHJ) with fully textured wafer is only 25.2% due to incompatibility between the limitation of fabrication technology which is not compatible with the production&#8208;line silicon wafer. Here, a molecular&#8208;level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiOx/2PACz ([2&#8208;(9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite layer on top. The NiOx interlayer facilitates a uniform self&#8208;assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top&#8208;cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2&#8208;cm2 masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production&#8208;line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.

Here, a molecular-level nanotechnology is developed by designing NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;/2PACz ([2-(9H-carbazol-9-yl) ethyl]phosphonic acid) as an ultrathin hybrid hole transport layer (HTL) above indium tin oxide (ITO)&#160;recombination junction, to serve as a vital pivot for achieving a conformal deposition of high-quality perovskite layer on top. The NiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; interlayer facilitates a uniform self-assembly of 2PACz molecules onto the fully textured surface, thus avoiding direct contact between ITO and perovskite top-cell for a minimal shunt loss. As a result of such interfacial engineering, the fully textured perovskite/silicon tandem cells obtain a certified efficiency of 28.84% on a 1.2-cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; masked area, which is the highest performance to date based on the fully textured, production-line compatible SHJ. This work advances commercially promising photovoltaics with high performance and low costs by adopting a meticulously designed HTL/perovskite interface.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visible Light Induced Ag&#8211;Polyoxometalate Coassembly into Single&#8208;Cluster Nanowires</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A schematic diagram of single&#8208;cluster nanowires constructed by Ag&#8208;polyoxometalate (POM) coassembly is presented. Ag clusters are generated by visible light induced reduction, which are then connected with POM clusters to form 1D superstructures with alternative arrangement. Ag&#8208;P2W17 nanowires perform enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization, due to the promoted electron transfer in nanowire heterojunctions.








Abstract
1D superlattices with long&#8208;ranged periodicity present extraordinary application properties due to their unique electronic structures. Here, the visible light driven synthesis of 1D single&#8208;cluster chains constructed by polyoxometalate (POM) and Ag clusters is reported, where two types of clusters align alternatively along the nanowire. Low symmetrical POM clusters of [P2W17O61]10&#8211;, [P2W15O56]12&#8211;, and [EuW10O36]9&#8211; can be used as building blocks. The directly bonding cluster units result in interactive electronic structures of Ag and POM clusters, as well as the greatly promoted electron transfer during the redox reaction. The Ag&#8211;P2W17 nanowires perform significantly enhanced activities in both electrochemical sensing and catalytic gasoline desulfurization compared with individual building blocks, demonstrating the extraordinary application properties and promising potentials of cluster&#8208;based heteroconstructions.

         <title>Multidimensional Perovskites for High Detectivity Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite thin films with a 2D&#8211;3D gradient result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Low&#8208;dimensional perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increase the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lower the dark current density to a record&#8208;value of 10&#8211;9&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, resulting in maximized sensitivity.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional perovskites attract increasing interest due to tunable optoelectronic properties and high stability. Here, it is shown that perovskite thin films with a vertical gradient in dimensionality result in graded electronic bandgap structures that are ideal for photodiode applications. Positioning low&#8208;dimensional, vertically&#8208;oriented perovskite phases at the interface with the electron blocking layer increases the activation energy for thermal charge generation and thereby effectively lowers the dark current density to a record&#8208;low value of 5 &#215; 10&#8722;9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 without compromising responsivity, resulting in a noise&#8208;current&#8208;based specific detectivity exceeding 7 &#215; 1012 Jones at 600&#160;nm. These multidimensional perovskite photodiodes show promising air stability and a dynamic range over ten orders of magnitude, and thus represent a new generation of high&#8208;performance low&#8208;cost photodiodes.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Anode&#8208;Less All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries via the Conversion Reaction of Metal Fluorides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A room&#8208;temperature anode&#8208;less all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery is reported by utilizing the conversion reaction of metal fluorides. Silver fluoride is identified as a seed component to induce uniform and reversible lithium plating via a conversion reaction that produces metallic silver nanodomains. These nanodomains, together with the lithium fluoride formed during the conversion reaction, enable sustainable cycling with an extremely high areal capacity.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) that employ anode&#8208;less electrodes have drawn attention from across the battery community because they offer competitive energy densities and a markedly improved cycle life. Nevertheless, the composite matrices of anode&#8208;less electrodes impose a substantial barrier for lithium&#8208;ion diffusion and inhibit operation at room temperature. To overcome this drawback, here, the conversion reaction of metal fluorides is exploited because metallic nanodomains formed during this reaction induce an alloying reaction with lithium ions for uniform and sustainable lithium (de)plating. Lithium fluoride (LiF), another product of the conversion reaction, prevents the agglomeration of the metallic nanodomains and also protects the electrode from fatal lithium dendrite growth. A systematic analysis identifies silver (I) fluoride (AgF) as the most suitable metal fluoride because the silver nanodomains can accommodate the solid&#8208;solution mechanism with a low nucleation overpotential. AgF&#8208;based full cells attain reliable cycling at 25 &#176;C even with an exceptionally high areal capacity of 9.7 mAh cm&#8722;2 (areal loading of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2&#160;= 50&#160;mg cm&#8211;2). These results offer useful insights into designing materials for anode&#8208;less electrodes for sulfide&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assembly of spherical, superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles on gold nanorods yields magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) that align in applied magnetic fields. Magnetic manipulation of the surface plasmon resonance of MagGNRs is comprehensively investigated through structural and optical characterization, and an analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment behavior. Dynamic alignment of MagGNRs is demonstrated in rotating magnetic fields.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of the MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. The MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <dc:description>
A zinc&#8208;ion battery (ZIB)&#160;pressuresensor where the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB is&#160;itself designed as a flexible pressure sensor has excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance, endowing it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs and ultrahigh stability. The sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.








Abstract
Accurate and continuous pressure signal detection without external power supply is a key technology to realize the miniaturization of wearable electronic equipment, the internet of things, and artificial intelligence. However, it is difficult to be achieved by using current sensor technologies. Here, a new one&#8208;body strategy, i.e., zinc&#8208;ion battery pressure (ZIB&#8208;P) sensor technology, which designs the rechargeable solid&#8208;state ZIB itself as a flexible pressure sensor is reported. In the device, an isolation layer is introduced into the sandwich configuration solid&#8208;state battery to realize the change of device internal resistance by pressure during the transformation of the mechanical signal to the electrical signal. This battery pressure sensor possesses good flexibility, fast response/recovery time (76.0/88.0&#160;ms), stable long&#8208;term response, excellent cycle stability (100&#8239;000 times), and wide pressure detection range (2.0 to 3.68 &#215; 105&#160;Pa). Especially, the excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance in the ZIB&#8208;P sensor endows it with the real&#8208;time detection ability of human vital signs (pulse, limb movement, etc.) and ultrahigh stability without degradation even under 100&#8239;000 times pressure stimulation. The ZIB&#8208;P sensor strategy provides a new solution for the future development of miniaturized wearable electronic devices.

         <title>Super&#8208;Linear&#8208;Threshold&#8208;Switching Selector with Multiple Jar&#8208;Shaped Cu&#8208;Filaments in the Amorphous Ge3Se7 Resistive Switching Layer in a Cross&#8208;Point Synaptic Memristor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial neural network consisting of a hardware&#8208;based cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array should employ selectors with two&#8208;terminal electrodes to prevent an undesired sneak current and to improve learning and inference efficiencies. Here, a highly reliable super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped Cu&#8208;filaments in the amorphous Ge3Se7 resistive switching layer by controlling the Cu ion concentration depth profile is developed.








Abstract
The learning and inference efficiencies of an artificial neural network represented by a cross&#8208;point synaptic memristor array can be achieved using a selector, with high selectivity (Ion/Ioff) and sufficient death region, stacked vertically on a synaptic memristor. This can prevent a sneak current in the memristor array. A selector with multiple jar&#8208;shaped conductive Cu filaments in the resistive switching layer is precisely fabricated by designing the Cu ion concentration depth profile of the CuGeSe layer as a filament source, TiN diffusion barrier layer, and Ge3Se7 switching layer. The selector performs super&#8208;linear&#8208;threshold&#8208;switching with a selectivity of &gt; 107, death region of &#8722;0.70&#8211;0.65 V, holding time of 300 ns, switching speed of 25 ns, and endurance cycle of &gt;&#160;106. In addition, the mechanism of switching is proven by the formation of conductive Cu filaments between the CuGeSe and Ge3Se7 layers under a positive bias on the top Pt electrode and an automatic rupture of the filaments after the holding time. Particularly, a spiking deep neural network using the designed one&#8208;selector&#8208;one&#8208;memory cross&#8208;point array improves the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology classification accuracy by &#8776;3.8% by eliminating the sneak current in the cross&#8208;point array during the inference process.

Phototransistors
In article number 2205679, Peiguang Yan, Zhenhua Sun, and co&#8208;workers report a near&#8208;infrared phototransistor with benign light&#8208;irradiance adaptability using a vertically stacking graphene/lead sulfide quantum dots/graphene heterojunction as the conductive channel. The dynamic trapping and detrapping processes in the quantum dot film enable the inhabitation or potentiation of the photoresponse, based on which the photopic or scotopic adaptation behavior of the human retina is successfully mimicked, respectively.

Skyrmion Motion
Understanding skyrmion motion is essential for the efficient operation of skyrmionic devices. In article number 2203275, Chanyong Hwang, Kyoung&#8208;Whan Kim, Albert Min Gyu Park, Kab&#8208;Jin Kim, and co&#8208;workers uncover a universal scaling behavior in the current&#8208;driven motion of skyrmions. The topology of the shape of the interface drags the skyrmions and causes them to show hopping properties distinct from the creep motion expected for magnetic domains. The universal scaling can provide insights for implementing skyrmion devices and understanding the dynamics of moving bodies with a closed interface.

Bioreactors
In article number 2109973, Liping Zhong, Kun Zhang, Yongxiang Zhao, and co&#8208;workers describe how a tumor&#8208;microenvironment&#8208;enabled in situ silver&#8208;based electrochemical oncolytic bioreactor (SEOB) unlocks antitumor Ag+ prodrugs for highly efficient subcutaneous and orthotopic tumor recession via activating production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Reduced graphene oxide (rGO), featuring 20&#8208;fold larger catalysis rate than GO, allows intratumoral H2O2 as reductants to reduce Ag+ into silver nanoparticles especially after uniting with vitamin&#8208;C&#8208;mediated H2O2 production.

         <title>Necklace&#8208;Like Nanostructures: From Fabrication, Properties to Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Due to their intriguing and specific appearance and architecture, necklace&#8208;like nanostructures carry some unique features over simple 1D nanogeometries. In this review, necklace&#8208;like structures by focusing on their diverse synthetic strategies, distinctive properties, and applications, as well as future directions for fabricating and capitalizing on necklace&#8208;like structures are summarized.








Abstract
The shape&#8208;controlled synthesis of nanocrystals remains a hot research topic in nanotechnology. Particularly, the fabrication of 1D structures such as wires, rods, belts, and tubes has been an interesting and important subject within nanoscience in the last few decades. 1D necklace&#8208;like micro/nanostructures are a sophisticated geometry that has attracted increasing attention due to their anisotropic and periodic structure, intrinsic high surface area, abundant transport channels, exposure of each component to the surface, and multiscale roughness of the surface. These characteristics enable their unique electrical, optical, and catalytic properties. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the advanced research progress on the fabrication strategies, novel properties, and various applications of necklace&#8208;like structures. It begins with the main fabrication methods of necklace&#8208;like structures and subsequently details a variety of their properties and applications. It concludes with the authors&#8217; perspectives on future research and development of the necklace&#8208;like structures.

         <title>Amplifying Molecular Scale Rotary Motion: The Marriage of Overcrowded Alkene Molecular Motor with Liquid Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 40, October 6, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amplifying the molecular rotary motion of photoresponsive overcrowded alkene molecular motor (OAMM) by liquid crystal provides great opportunities in design and fabrication of advanced materials and functional systems. This review summarizes the recent progress of the OAMM triggered light&#8208;directed systems and the challenges and outlooks in the development of OAMM&#8208;liquid crystal composite system are concluded.








Abstract
Design and fabrication of macroscopic functional devices by molecular engineering is an emerging and effective strategy in exploration of advanced materials. Photoresponsive overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motor (OAMM) is considered as one of the most promising molecular machines due to the unique rotary motion driven by light with high temporal and spatial precision. Amplifying the molecular rotary motions into macroscopic behaviors of photodirected systems links the molecular dynamics with macroscopic motions of materials, providing new opportunities to design novel materials and devices with a bottom&#8208;up strategy. In this review, recent developments of the light&#8208;responsive liquid crystal system triggered by OAMM will be summarized. The mechanism of amplification effect of liquid crystal matrix will be introduced first. Then progress of the OAMM&#8208;driven liquid crystal materials will be described including light&#8208;controlled photonic crystals, texture&#8208;tunable liquid crystal coating and microspheres, photoactuated soft robots, and dynamic optical devices. It is hoped that this review provides inspirations in design and exploration of light&#8208;driven soft matters and novel functional materials from molecular engineering to structural modification.
