         <title>Phonon Driven Ferroelectricity and Raman Active Modes in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric domains, a hallmark of ferroelectricity, are studied using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy to uncover characteristic phonons associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in different n&#8208;value HOIPs. Higher n&#8208;value HOIP demonstrate a reduced ferroelectric switching energy barrier, providing valuable insights for optimizing domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising ferroelectric semiconductors, yet the phonon signatures governing their ferroelectricity remain poorly understood. Here, by analyzing the temperature&#8208;dependent Raman peak profiles of highly ordered ferroelectric domains in HOIPs, a framework to systematically investigate the dimensionality (n)&#8208;dependent phonons that are critical to ferroelectric behaviour is established. By tracking phonon evolution across the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in HOIPs with different n, characteristic modes associated with the ferroelectric symmetry&#8208;breaking process are identified. Notably, in the ferroelectric phase of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (n = 3), these modes exhibit a redshift compared to those in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (n = 2), reflecting a reduced energy barrier for ferroelectric switching. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further correlate these modes with their spectral signatures in Raman spectroscopy, particularly highlighting zone&#8208;boundary modes that diminish upon transitioning to the paraelectric phase. Polarized Raman mapping further reveals adjacent ferroelectric domains with orthogonal polarization orientations, directly linking phonon activity to domain configuration. This work elucidates the role of phonons in HOIP ferroelectricity, offering insights for tailoring domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Probing the Effect of Electrode Thermodynamics on Reaction Heterogeneity in Thick Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thick electrodes promise higher battery energy density but suffer from reaction heterogeneity. While typically attributed to sluggish charge transport, this study shows how thermodynamic properties of active materials also have critical influence. Through advanced X&#8208;ray characterization of LiFePO4 and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 thick electrodes, stark differences in their reaction gradients are revealed and a predictive metric to guide electrode design is introduced.








Abstract
Thick electrodes present a viable strategy for enhancing energy density and reducing manufacturing costs of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, reaction heterogeneity during cycling compromises their rate capability and cycle life. While this nonuniformity is commonly attributed to sluggish charge transport, it is demonstrated here that the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material play an equally critical role. Through combined X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy and absorption near&#8208;edge structure spectroscopy, reaction distributions in LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) thick electrodes with matched porosity and tortuosity are compared. LFP electrodes develop pronounced depth&#8208;oriented state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SOC) gradients that worsen with increasing discharge rates, whereas NMC maintains much more uniform SOC distributions under such conditions. This difference originates from their distinct SOC dependence of equilibrium potentials and is quantifiable through a dimensionless &#8220;reaction uniformity&#8221; number. Intriguingly, LFP thick electrodes also exhibit lateral SOC variations that strengthen during slow discharge. The enhanced reaction uniformity in NMC correlates with better active material utilization and slower capacity fade than LFP, highlighting electrode thermodynamics as a key design consideration for thick electrodes.

         <title>Catalytically Active Light Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scale 3D&#8208;printed multi&#8208;material structures incorporating photocatalytically active Ru(II) sites using a dual&#8208;function photoresin is introduced. The system utilizes a Ru(II)&#8208;functionalized monomer, enabling the assembly of 3D structures with commercially available crosslinkers. The catalytic activity is demonstrated through the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced additive manufacturing (3D printing) has revolutionized manufacturing and its integration into the fabrication of catalysts holds key potential to enable facile access to optimized catalyst geometries and designs. Herein &#8211; for the first time &#8211; micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;sized photocatalytically active 3D printed objects are introduced via a dual&#8208;function photoresin using a ruthenium(II) complex containing monomer as both a photoinitiator for the 3D printing process and as the active photocatalyst within the printed structure. The approach leverages the spatial and temporal control afforded by light&#8208;induced 3D printing techniques during both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon printing to precisely position the photocatalyst within intricate geometries using a pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) based resin. The successful incorporation of ruthenium(II) complexes is demonstrated via time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) into desired sections of 3D&#8208;printed objects. The one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon fabricated architectures show photocatalytic activity in the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides. The potential of tailored catalytically active 3D objects is exemplified by one of the microscale designs. This design, utilizing only 1% of the volume of a macroscale structure fabricated from the same resin, achieved 75% of the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Cloud Inspired White and Grey Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Camouflaged Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by clouds' role in Earth's thermal management, this work presents disordered plasmonic metasurfaces that mimic their radiative effects. The white metasurface enhances backscattering, acting as a cooling layer with camouflage properties. The grey state suppresses backscattering and enhances light trapping, surpassing conventional black absorbers. These metasurfaces enable advancements in camouflage, low&#8208;emissivity coatings, and thermal infrared stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's color&#8208;driven thermal regulation mechanisms and the atmospheric radiative effects of cloud&#8208;aerosol interactions, this work presents the design of disordered metasurfaces capable of achieving white and grey plasmonic colors. This innovation advances light and thermal management technologies within the framework of stealth and camouflage applications. The white plasmonic metasurfaces emulate the cooling effects of clouds, reducing substrate temperatures by a relative &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C under standard solar illumination through backscattering. In contrast, transitioning to a grey state with a nanocomposite absorber suppresses backscattering and enables efficient light trapping, resulting in a relative +10 &#160;&#176;C temperature increase compared to conventional black absorbers. These findings introduce a novel approach to localized thermal management, distinct from traditional passive cooling strategies that rely on high&#8208;emissivity materials. The metasurfaces&#8217; low&#8208;emissivity properties and visible appearance open opportunities in advanced camouflage, stealth technologies, and thermal energy solutions. Additionally, the scalable, sustainable design, realized through all&#8208;in&#8208;chamber nanofabrication via sputtering, eliminates the need for chemically intensive synthesis methods while ensuring long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Manipulating Ferroelectric Topological Polar Structures with Twisted Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate dynamic control of ferroelectric order in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 using twisted ultraviolet light carrying orbital angular momentum. Our approach harnesses non&#8208;resonant multiphoton absorption and induced strain to modulate topological of ferroelectric polarization textures. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray coherent imaging and Raman spectroscopy reveal reversible, nanoscale polarization transitions, enabling efficient stabilization of topological solitons and paving the way for novel optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The dynamic control of non&#8208;equilibrium states represents a central challenge in condensed matter physics.

&lt;p&gt;We demonstrate dynamic control of ferroelectric order in quasi-2D CsBiNb2O7 using twisted ultraviolet light carrying orbital angular momentum. Our approach harnesses non-resonant multiphoton absorption and induced strain to modulate topological of ferroelectric polarization textures. In-situ X-ray coherent imaging and Raman spectroscopy reveal reversible, nanoscale polarization transitions, enabling efficient stabilization of topological solitons and paving the way for novel optoelectronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Atmospheric Water Sorption&#8211;Desorption as a Pathway for Green Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the energy conversion from the process of sorption and desorption of water molecules. By detailing the mechanism studies, guidelines are provided for the performance enhancement in the sequence of energy conversion. It provides insights into understanding the recent advances of hydrovoltaic technology and leads to future improvement of the harnessed energy.








Abstract
Beyond the indispensable resource for living creatures, water has recently been explored as an eco&#8208;friendly source of energy, known as the hydrovoltaic technology. Of significant interest, the cyclic sorption/desorption of water molecules physically and chemically induces the gaseous/liquid&#8211;solid interactions with the substances, demonstrating potential for harnessing electricity. Existing efforts have focused on materials engineering and structural design of the energy generators, enhancing the generated electricity for real&#8208;life applications. Despite the substantial achievements, the principal interpretation of the process from water molecules to electricity establishes the foundation and serves as the guidance for device modification and performance enhancement. Herein, this review thoroughly discusses the energy conversion, from the introduction of water molecules to the generation of electricity, starting with an understanding of the sorption/desorption of water molecules. Mechanisms in charge creation from the interaction are then elucidated, where water molecules themselves serve as ions or stimulate ion dissociation from the substances. It continues with an overview of the existing advancements in sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity generation and practical demonstrations of the developed electricity. Based on the conversion procedure, insights for upcoming generator designs are proposed subsequently. Finally, present challenges to be addressed and perspectives on future development in the sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity are discussed in detail.

         <title>2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse Realizing In&#8208;Sensor Intensity&#8208;Spanning Visual Feature Fusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D TSAS that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion is presented, enabled by combined in&#8208;plane anisotropy and time&#8208;stretching photoresponse of 2D NbOI2. Leveraging these properties, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains has been constructed, achieving accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, offering a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.








Abstract
High&#8208;dynamic&#8208;range (HDR) visual environments, where extremely bright and dark regions coexist, pose major challenges for conventional imaging systems that rely on multi&#8208;frame exposure fusion and cloud&#8208;based post&#8208;processing. These approaches often suffer from high latency, limited efficiency, and privacy concerns, making them unsuitable for real&#8208;time or edge&#8208;level intelligent vision. Here, a 2D Time&#8208;Stretching Anisotropic Synapse (2D TSAS) is reported that enables in&#8208;sensor intensity&#8208;spanning feature fusion from a single image frame. The 2D TSAS uniquely integrates two key features of NbOI2 material: in&#8208;plane anisotropy, which gives rise to polarization&#8208;resolved optical responses, and a time&#8208;stretching photoresponse arising from multi&#8208;channel transition&#8208;relaxation. This dual&#8208;mode mechanism enables direct encoding and temporal integration of spatial&#8208;polarization and luminance features during photoexcitation. Leveraging this behavior, a neuromorphic preprocessing strategy is constructed for single&#8208;shot visual learning across extreme brightness domains. The system achieves accelerated model convergence with minimal training loss, reaching recognition accuracies of &#8776;95.41% on NWPU&#8208;RESISC45 and &#8776;95.39% on MNIST. This work offers a compact and efficient solution for contrast&#8208;adaptive intelligent vision in complex real&#8208;world environments.

         <title>Highly Efficient and Stable Green Quantum Rod LEDs Enabled by Material and Charge Injection Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS quantum rods with gradient shell, uniform shape, and shortened ligands enable high PLQY and efficient charge injection. Combined with a double hole transport layer structure to suppress electron leakage and enhance hole injection, the resulting QRLEDs achieve 24% EQE, &gt;500&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2 brightness, and &gt;22&#8201;000 h T&#8325;&#8320; lifetime, advancing high&#8208;performance display applications.








Abstract
Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are a promising technology for the next generation of flexible and large&#8208;area displays, offering high brightness, tunable narrow emission, and high display contrast. Although internal quantum efficiency (IQE) has reached unity, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of LEDs utilizing spherical quantum dots (QDs) is limited by low light outcoupling efficiency (&#951;out). A promising approach to improve &#951;out is using horizontal alignment of nanocrystals&#8217; transition dipole moments, such as aligned quantum rods (QRs), which provide directional light emission. Though the IQE for QRs has recently improved significantly, creating efficient and bright green&#8208;emitting QRs (515&#8211;560 nm) remains a big challenge, which is essential for full&#8208;color display applications. In this study, a uniform and highly bright green&#8208;emitting CdSe/ZnxCd1&#8208;xS QRs of gradient shell structure are synthesized with minimized shell thickness and reduced Zn content, coupled with shorter organic ligands to reduce the energy barriers and enhance carriers injection. The electron leakage current at the interface between the polymeric hole transport layer (HTL) and QRs is the primary factor limiting the QRLED's performance. HTL with a higher energy offset is employed to prevent electron leakage at the organic/inorganic interface. Furthermore, is developed a bilayer HTL that enhances hole injections while minimizing electron leakage, thereby improving charge balance. The resulting QRLEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high efficiency, with an EQE of 24%, current efficiency (CE) of 89 cd&#160;A&#8722;1, and maximum brightness (Lmax) exceeding 500k cd&#160;m&#8722;2. Additionally, they exhibited an extended operational T50 lifetime of over 22k h at 100 cd&#160;m&#8722;2, making them well&#8208;suited for high&#8208;color&#8208;gamut display and lighting applications.

         <title>Universal Ion Migration Suppression Strategy Based on Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Interaction for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional layers are stabilized by the simultaneous suppression of the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules (C8A). The C8A&#8208;doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a PCE of 26.01% (certified 25.68%). The C8A&#8208;modified p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%). The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015 h of continuous operation at maximum power point.








Abstract
The migration of multiple chemical species is are main factor leading to the intrinsic instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a universal ion migration suppression strategy is innovatively reported to stabilize multiple functional layers by simultaneously suppressing the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules. After incorporating 4&#8208;tert&#8208;butylcalix[8]arene (C8A), the interfacial defects are passivated, suppressing trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the p&#8208;doping of Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is facilitated, and the extraction and transport of holes are promoted for n&#8208;i&#8208;p regular PSCs. The C8A doped regular devices based on the two&#8208;step perovskite deposition method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% (certified 25.68%), which is the record PCE ever reported for the TiO2&#8208;based planar PSCs. The C8A passivated p&#8208;i&#8208;n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%), which is the highest PCE for the PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation method. The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015&#160;h of continuous operation at maximum power point.

     alt="Universal Ion Migration Suppression Strategy Based on Supramolecular Host&#8211;Guest Interaction for High-Performance Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Multiple functional layers are stabilized by the simultaneous suppression of the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules (C8A). The C8A-doped regular devices based on the two-step perovskite deposition method achieve a PCE of 26.01% (certified 25.68%). The C8A-modified p-i-n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%). The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015 h of continuous operation at maximum power point.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The migration of multiple chemical species is are main factor leading to the intrinsic instability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a universal ion migration suppression strategy is innovatively reported to stabilize multiple functional layers by simultaneously suppressing the migration of multiple mobile chemical species based on host&#8211;guest interaction via calixarene supramolecules. After incorporating 4-tert-butylcalix[8]arene (C8A), the interfacial defects are passivated, suppressing trap-assisted nonradiative recombination. Moreover, the p-doping of Spiro-OMeTAD is facilitated, and the extraction and transport of holes are promoted for n-i-p regular PSCs. The C8A doped regular devices based on the two-step perovskite deposition method achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.01% (certified 25.68%), which is the record PCE ever reported for the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-based planar PSCs. The C8A passivated p-i-n inverted PSCs obtain a champion PCE of 27.18% (certified 26.79%), which is the highest PCE for the PSCs using the vacuum flash evaporation method. The resulting unsealed inverted device retains 95% of its initial PCE after 1015&#160;h of continuous operation at maximum power point. This work provides a feasible and effective avenue to address the intrinsic instability of perovskite-based photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stretchable, Multiplexed, and Bimodal Sensing Electronic Armor for Colonoscopic Continuum Robot Enhanced by Triboelectric Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colonoscopic continuum robots lack sensing, endangering intestinal tissue. An ideal sensing array is hard to integrate. This work introduces a 3D crosslinked stretchable E&#8208;armor with full&#8208;coverage and multiplexing. It has bimodal sensing, forms a triboelectric synapse, uses CNN&#8208;LSTM, and has a hydrogel and innovative triboelectric materials. A control strategy and digital twin interface enhance safety and interaction in colonoscopy.








Abstract
Colonoscopic continuum robots often lack sensing capabilities, risking tissue damage. An ideal robot electronic skin should offer full&#8208;body coverage, multiplexing, stretchability, and multifunctionality, but integration is challenging due to the robot's elongated structure. This work presents a stretchable electronic armor (E&#8208;armor) with a 3D crosslinked structure that enables 300&#160;mm full coverage while accomplishing multiplexed simultaneous tactile and strain sensing through bioinspired artificial synapse mechanisms. The E&#8208;armor integrates 48 tactile sensing points through bilayer co&#8208;electrode strategy, reducing wiring while combining triboelectric encoding intelligence with innovative stretchable triboelectric interlinked films (TIFs) to form a triboelectric artificial synapse that generates digitally encoded signal pairs upon contact. A convolutional neural network and long short&#8208;term memory network (CNN&#8208;LSTM) deep learning framework achieve 99.31% accuracy in identifying multi&#8208;point tactile signals. A sodium alginate/polyacrylamide/sodium chloride (SA/PAM/NaCl) conductive hydrogel serves as a strain sensing element, providing excellent stretchability and biocompatibility, and allowing precise inference of bending angles at 12 strain sensing edges. A compliance control strategy coordinates tactile and strain signals to autonomously adjust continuum robot postures while ensuring smooth operation. The digital twin&#8208;based 3D visualization interface enhances human&#8211;robot interaction by digitally reconstructing both tactile and strain feedback, enabling real&#8208;time visualization of the continuum robot's intracolonic posture.

Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Single&#8208;Step Approach for the Controlled Synthesis of Multifunctional Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile one&#8208;pot strategy combines bipolar electrochemistry and the water&#8208;organic interface to synthesize in a single&#8208;step complex patchy particles, which cannot be achieved by any other deposition process. Under the influence of an electric field, microparticles undergo selective surface modification via coupled redox reactions, enabling simultaneous deposition of several materials, resulting in distinct patches with different chemical features.








Abstract
Multicomponent patchy particles offer unique opportunities for diverse applications, yet their controlled synthesis remains challenging. Here a strategy is presented that allows generating complex microparticles, having distinct patches of different chemical composition, by using a one&#8208;pot and single&#8208;step approach. The concept is based on the synergetic combination of bipolar electrochemistry and a water/organic (w/o) interface as the reaction space. Positioning conducting microspheres at the w/o interface allows for targeted surface modification with multiple components. Under the influence of an applied electric field, oriented parallel to the interface, simultaneous redox reactions in both phases lead to the selective deposition of up to four different materials at opposite faces of the particles. This very versatile approach can also be extended beyond spherical particles for the controlled modification of 2D materials. The simplicity of the method and the inherent precise control over multiple functional components allows for the design of advanced multicomponent patchy particles, which cannot be obtained by any other deposition process.

         <title>Exceptional Oxidation Resistance of High&#8208;Entropy Carbides up to 3600&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
(Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C high&#8208;entropy carbides with exceptional oxidation resistance of 2.7 &#181;m&#183;s&#8722;1 up to 3600&#160;&#176;C are successfully explored through a high&#8208;entropy compositional engineering strategy. The exceptional oxidation resistance primarily results from the formation of unique dual&#8208;structural oxide layers that involve numerous high&#8208;melting&#8208;point W particles uniformly embedded within the molten (Hf, Me)6(Ta, Me)2O17 major phase.








Abstract
Achieving exceptional oxidation resistance at elevated temperatures is long desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;temperature materials to be used in relevant applications such as hypersonic flights, re&#8208;entry vehicles, and propulsion systems. However, their practical service temperatures are typically limited to below 3000&#160;&#176;C. Here, the exploration of (Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C high&#8208;entropy carbides with exceptional oxidation resistance of 2.7 &#181;m&#183;s&#8722;1 up to 3600&#160;&#176;C through a high&#8208;entropy compositional engineering strategy is reported. This impressive oxidation behavior arises from the formation of unique dual&#8208;structural oxide layers involving numerous high&#8208;melting&#8208;point W particles uniformly embedded within molten (Hf, Me)6(Ta, Me)2O17 (Me = metal element, Hf, Ta, Zr, and W) primary oxides. The developed (Hf, Ta, Zr, W)C demonstrates a significant breakthrough for ultrahigh&#8208;temperature applications up to 3600&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for further design of advanced ultrahigh&#8208;temperature materials capable of serving at higher service temperatures.

The VTCB technique is developed for wafer&#8208;scale, ultra&#8208;clean stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs with precise angular control. This method overcomes conventional limitations, enhancing interfacial integrity, uniformity, compositional flexibility, and twist&#8208;angle manipulation, exemplified by multilayer 3R&#8208;MoS&#8322; retaining bulk&#8208;like properties. The technique is semiconductor&#8208;process&#8208;compatible, offering a scalable platform for fundamental research and device development.








Abstract
The twisting and stacking of 2D materials have emerged as transformative strategies for discovering novel physical phenomena and designing advanced materials and devices. A significant challenge, however, is achieving pristine interfaces with precise angular control while maintaining the long&#8208;range order over large areas. In this work, a novel dry&#8208;transfer method is presented that enables the ultra&#8208;clean integration of epitaxial, single&#8208;crystalline transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) via vacuum thermocompression bonding (VTCB). This technique facilitates the fabrication of wafer&#8208;scale twisting and stacking of single&#8208;crystalline TMDCs to form homo&#8208;and heterostructures with intrinsic material properties and precise angular control. The layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer reconstruction of single&#8208;crystalline multilayer 2H&#8208;and 3R&#8208;MoS2 is demonstrated, with structural, electrical, and optical properties comparable to those of the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, the approach is fully compatible with standard semiconductor fabrication workflows and equipment, offering a scalable pathway for automated high&#8208;throughput fabrication. This findings provide a new avenue for the large&#8208;scale production of multi&#8208;stacked materials and twist&#8208;electronic device arrays.

&lt;p&gt;The VTCB technique is developed for wafer-scale, ultra-clean stacking of single-crystalline TMDCs with precise angular control. This method overcomes conventional limitations, enhancing interfacial integrity, uniformity, compositional flexibility, and twist-angle manipulation, exemplified by multilayer 3R-MoS&#8322; retaining bulk-like properties. The technique is semiconductor-process-compatible, offering a scalable platform for fundamental research and device development.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Ga2O3 In&#8208;Memory DUV Photodetectors By Interface Charge Reservoir Design for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. The device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance. Further, the potential of the device in weak&#8208;light imaging enhancement, light information storage, and light moving path recording in the passive mode is excavated for the first time.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance detectors has played a key role in the innovation of modern optoelectronics. However, the implementation of high&#8208;performance detectors has been a huge challenge, especially the present detectors with only optoelectronic conversion functions cannot satisfy the growing demands of the multifunction required in single devices. Here, it is demonstrated a novel in&#8208;memory photodetector based on wide bandgap semiconductor Ga2O3 by integrating memory characteristics into the detector. Originating from the dynamic control of the channel carriers by the interface charge reservoir under illumination and electrical, the device exhibits extraordinary memory characteristics and photodetection performance. The ultrahigh&#8208;speed programming/erasing operations in the range of nanoseconds with an extinction ratio up to 109 is achieved. Moreover, the in&#8208;memory photodetectors achieve near&#8208;zero dark current, record high responsivity (6.7 &#215; 107 A&#160;W&#8722;1), and sensitivity for UV light, making them the most sensitive UV photodetectors. Further, the potential of the device in weak&#8208;light imaging enhancement, light information storage, and light moving path recording in the passive mode is excavated for the first time. This work enables new device capabilities and opens new opportunities for the development of high&#8208;performance in&#8208;memory detectors.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

         <dc:description>
This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention. In recent years, cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials enable delicate nano&#8208;/microscale structural construction, thus promoting developments in the field of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. However, there is still a limited number of reviews focused on cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials for applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. This review aims to fill this research gap by introducing various cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials and providing a detailed analysis of their fashionable applications in nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors. The goal is to present cellulose&#8208;templated nanomaterials as highly promising template and guest materials for templating technologies, offering sustainable nano&#8208;/microscale control over advanced materials for the foreseeable future. This potential is promising for new applications in the fields of nanogenerators and self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It covers key biopolymer types, structures, and properties, and explores their applications as artificial SEIs, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The review highlights how these biopolymers enhance electrochemical performance and discusses current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) and zinc (Zn) metals are emerging as promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation rechargeable metal batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacities. However, issues such as uneven metal ion deposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth result in poor electrochemical stability, limited cycle life, and rapid capacity decay. Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

         <title>Emerging Sustainable Structural Materials by Assembling Cellulose Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Derived Carbon Materials for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <title>Biopolymer&#8208;Based Flame Retardants and Flame&#8208;Retardant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

&lt;p&gt;2,2,6,6-Tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean-electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell-level energy density of 503 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mg&lt;sub&gt;sulfur&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-oxyl radical (TEMPO)-oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean-electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter-glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh g&lt;sub&gt;sulfur&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte-to-sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sub&gt;sulfur&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), yielding a high cell-level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecularly Functionalized Biomass Hydrogels for Sustainable Atmospheric Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <title>Sustainable Silk Fibroin Ionic Touch Screens for Flexible Biodegradable Electronics with Integrated AI and IoT Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post-processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering Triboelectric Paper for Energy Harvesting and Smart Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering nano&#8208;graphite coated paper (NG@P) is produced to serve as triboelectric layers and electrodes for TENGs. Ultra&#8208;high power density above 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2 is achieved due to the electrostatic discharge on the surface. Moreover, smart home sensors are fabricated using the NG@P for motion sensing and sleep monitoring, which could be used for security and healthcare applications.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract

     alt="A Bio-Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo-materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Wood and Cellulose: the Most Sustainable Advanced Materials for Past, Present, and Future Civilizations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Defect Nitrogen&#8208;Rich Carbon Nitride&#8208;Based Heterostructural Nanocatalyst for Improving the Therapeutic Efficacy of &#945;PD&#8208;1 via Tumor Immune Microenvironment Remodelling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrasound responsive carbon nitride&#8208;based heterostructural nanocatalyst of tri&#8208;modality catalytic ROS generation and cell cuproptosis inducing properties is fabricated and employed to remodel the suppressive tumor immune microenvironment, by triggering immunogenic cell death of tumor, activating systematic antitumor immune response, and repolarizing the tumor&#8208;associated macrophages, which remarkably improves the therapeutic efficacy of &#945;PD&#8208;1 on orthotopic osteosarcoma.








Abstract
Low immunogenicity, insufficient immune infiltrates, and inhibitive microenvironment of tumors ruthlessly weakened the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapies. How to improve the therapy efficacy by reshaping the tumor immune microenvironment still remains a challenge that needs to be urgently addressed. Here, a novel dual&#8208;defect nitrogen&#8208;rich carbon nitride&#8208;based heterostructural nanocatalyst (CNO@CuMS) possessing brilliant piezocatalytic H2O2 generation, sonocatalytic 1O2 generation, Fenton&#8208;like catalytic &#8226;OH generation, and cell cuproptosis inducing properties are developed. Accompanied by the ultrasonic treatment, immunogenic cell death (ICD) and the subsequent releasing of damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) of tumor cells are successfully triggered by CNO@CuMS, which resulted in the activation of systematic antitumor response and enhanced the infiltration of CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells at tumor site. The large quantitatively generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) also promoted the polarization of M2&#8208;type macrophage to M1&#8208;type as well. Benefitting from this tumor immune microenvironment remodelling effect, remarkable malignant orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy efficacy is achieved employing CNO@CuMS + &#945;PD&#8208;1 combination strategy under ultrasonic treatment, with no significant side effects are observed. This research not only proposes a method to fabricate high proformance carbon nitride&#8208;based nanocatalyst but also provides a new strategy to realize highly efficient malignant bone tumor therapy during clinical practice.

         <title>Designing Moderately&#8208;Solvating Electrolytes for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly&#8208;solvating solvent, a weakly&#8208;solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent. The optimal MSE significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs by doubling that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and enables stable calendar life for at least seven months.








Abstract
New electrolytes are critical for high&#8208;energy lithium (Li)&#8211;sulfur (S) batteries (LSBs) to ensure their stability against Li metal anode and polysulfides (PSs) shuttling which hinder the large&#8208;scale application of LSBs. In this study, the design principle of moderately solvating electrolytes (MSEs) for LSBs is demonstrated by using a multiple&#8208;solvent system comprising of a highly solvating solvent, a weakly solvating solvent, and a non&#8208;solvating solvent to create a well&#8208;balanced electrolyte system. This resulting electrolyte significantly improves the cycle life of LSBs, achieving 300 cycles, which is twice as long as that of similar cells with the conventional electrolyte and it also ensures stable calendar life for at least seven months. The optimal MSE forms robust passivation layers enhancing the structural integrity of both S and Li metal electrodes after cycling. These virtues effectively hinder parasitic side reactions and self&#8208;discharge behavior of LSBs. This electrolyte design principle is versatile and can be applied to other battery chemistries, providing a potential path toward the development of a more efficient and stable battery system. By addressing key challenges such as the instability of electrodes and shuttling of polysulfides, this electrolyte approach offers promising solutions for advancing LSB technology.

         <title>Directionally Modulated Zinc Deposition by a Robust Zincophilic Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine Protective Layer in Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the precisely anchored zincophilic sites, the ample transport channels with rich redox active sites, and the suppressed hydrogen evolution by the copper (Cu) sites, a highly conjugated robust Cu&#8208;Phthalocyanine covalent organic framework layer is designed and applied for directional modulation of zinc (Zn) ions and dendrite&#8208;free Zn deposition in aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The directional modulation of zinc (Zn) deposition with further investigation of the dendrite&#8208;formation mechanism is vital in artificial anode protective layer for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, a robust metalated covalent organic framework (CuPc&#8208;COF) used as the artificial anode protective layer is proposed, in which the zincophilic sites of &#960;&#8208;conjugated periodic skeletons are precisely designed to modulate the directional migration of Zn2+, the multiple redox&#8208;active sites facilitate the Zn2+ confinement and transfer, and the central metal copper (Cu)&#160;serves as the inhibitor to eliminate the hydrogen evolution side reactions. By combining theoretical calculations with experiments, the &#960;&#8208;conjugated planar CuPc&#8208;COF layer is a desired protective coating of AZIB anodes with directionally transport channels and abundant redox active sites, thus inducing two&#8208;dimensional deposition of Zn. Attributed to these superiorities, the fabricated CuPc&#8208;COF@Zn anode demonstrates excellent cycling lifespan in both symmetrical cell (exceeding 2500&#160;h at 1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and full cell with different cathodes (more than 3000 cycles at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), outperforming most reported zinc anodes with COF&#8208;based layers.

         <title>High Entropy Alloy Thin Films as Efficient Spin&#8208;Orbit Torque Sources for Spintronic Memories</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;entropy alloys with significantly diluted heavy metal content are found to be a very efficient source of spin&#8208;orbit torques for spintronic applications. Epitaxially&#8208;grown 4&#8208;, 5&#8208;, 6&#8208;element alloy thin films are successfully integrated in magnetic racetrack memory devices, showing efficient domain wall motion, thereby adding a large family of materials to those that can be exploited for spin current generation.








Abstract
High entropy alloys (HEAs) containing multiple elements are emerging as advanced materials with enhanced functionalities. However, their use for spintronic applications remains elusive. Here, it is demonstrated that iridium based HEAs, grown by magnetron sputtering at room temperature, can be used as spin Hall layers. These films display highly efficient conversion of charge current into spin current. They also allow for the epitaxial growth of magnetic multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy as well as synthetic antiferromagnets using a ternary RuAlGa antiferromagnetic coupling layer. It is demonstrated that iridium&#8208;based HEAs serve as effective sources of spin&#8208;orbit torque, as quantified by spin&#8208;torque ferromagnetic resonance and harmonic Hall measurements, enabling current&#8208;induced magnetization reversal and domain wall motion. The threshold current density for current&#8208;induced magnetization switching is found to be as low as &#8764;10 MA cm&#8722;2 with reproducible deterministic switching, and that domain walls in HEA&#8208;based racetracks can be driven at speeds of up to 300 m s&#8722;1 at a current density of 65 MA cm&#8722;2. These results show that HEAs should be considered for high&#8208;performance spintronic applications.

         <title>Single&#8211;Atom Supported Catalysts and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In contrast to traditional supports, single&#8211;atom catalyst supports possess abundant unsaturated coordination sites and diverse electronic states. They are used to accommodate active metal species, thereby modulating the strong metal&#8208;support interactions and influencing catalytic performance. The enhancement mechanisms due to site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interactions in single&#8211;atom supported catalysts can be categorized into two types: electronic interaction and synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Tuning electronic configurations of active components in supported metal catalysts can be achieved via strong metal&#8211;support interaction (SMSI) between loaded metal species and support, which has a profound effect on catalytic efficiency. Distinct from conventional supports, single&#8211;atom catalysts, due to their rich unsaturated coordination metal sites and versatile electronic states, are employed as supports to load active metal species, which can manipulate the SMSI and thereby regulate catalytic performance. Although single&#8211;atom supported catalysts have demonstrated remarkable advance in catalytic capabilities, this field is still in its infancy with a large room for improvement. Here, definition, classification, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art characterization techniques of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts are summarily demonstrated. The enhancement mechanisms influenced by site&#8208;specific strong metal&#8208;support interaction within single&#8211;atom supported catalysts including electronic interactions and synergistic catalysis are highlighted to present their potentials and advantages for catalysis community. Moreover, various single&#8211;atom supported catalysts with advanced components are summarized to discuss the relationships between components and catalytic properties. Finally, challenges and perspectives of single&#8211;atom supported catalysts for directions of future development are provided.

         <title>Heterocluster&#8208;Assembled Crystalline Hydrophobic Complexes with Delayed Fluorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia, integrating [Sn4O8] and [Cu8S8] SBUs via a bifunctional m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (D&#8208;A ligand) is presented. The donor&#8211;acceptor heterojunction spatially separates HOMO ([Cu8S8] core) and LUMO (carboxylate), enabling thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) through minimized &#916;EST, driven by D&#8208;A ligand&#8208;enhanced CT&#8208;state emission. mMBA suppresses nonradiative decay while hydrophobic Sn&#8324; units confer hydrolytic stability without quenching Cu&#8211;S luminescence. This work pioneers heterocluster MOFs for stable optoelectronic materials.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with metal&#9472;sulfur bonds exhibit unique electrical, redox, and optical properties. However, their development has been hindered by rapid nucleation during crystallization. To address this challenge, amine&#8208;based modulators to retard nucleation through competitive coordination with ligands, enabling the synthesis of a series of Cu&#8208;S cluster&#8208;based MOFs with diverse network topologies: Cu&#8208;BDT&#8208;hcb (1), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;acs (2), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;pcu (3), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;sql (4), Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;dia (5), and Cu&#8208;TBT&#8208;hcb (6), are utilized. Using donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) ligands (o/p&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid&#8212;o/pMBA), [Sn4]&#8208;based MOFs: Sn&#8208;oDTBA&#8208;cds (7) and Sn&#8208;pDTBA&#8208;pcu (8), are fabricated. During synthesis, sulfhydryl groups underwent reductive coupling to generate novel dicarboxylate ligands with disulfide (S&#8211;S) linkages. Notably, the first bimetallic heterocluster MOF, SnCu&#8208;mMBA&#8208;dia (9), incorporating both a metal&#8208;oxygen cluster [Sn4O2(carboxylate)4] and a metal&#8208;sulfur cluster [Cu8(thiolate)8] is developed. This framework, constructed using m&#8208;mercaptobenzoic acid (mMBA) as a D&#8211;A bifunctional ligand, exhibits spatially separated HOMO and LUMO, minimizing the singlet&#8211;triplet energy gap to promote thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF). Compound 9 also demonstrates exceptional hydrolytic stability due to steric shielding by hydrophobic organotin moieties. This work pioneers a modulator&#8208;assisted strategy for heterocluster MOF construction, offering a paradigm for designing stable luminescent materials with tailored optoelectronic functionalities.

         <title>Superwetting Catalysts: Principle, Design, and Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here strategies for constructing superwetting catalyst systems via physical mixing and chemical modification are highlighted. The physical mixing strategy emphasizes the selection and classification of diverse superwetting inorganic materials and polymers, while the chemical modification approach focuses on the design of molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks, and single&#8208;atom catalysts with tailored surface wettability.








Abstract
Superwettability has revolutionized catalyst design for multiphase reactions by significantly enhancing interfacial interactions and mass transport. Here the design principles and synthesis strategies of superwetting catalysts are primarily introduced, with a particular focus on their confinement effects and mass transport mechanisms. First, the critical roles of superwettability is highlighted in facilitating efficient reactant mass transport, product desorption, and intermediate confinement within catalysts, which are pivotal for optimizing multiphase reaction systems. Besides, the key strategies, including physical mixing and chemical modification, are summarized to engineer superwettability interfaces in catalysts. Particular attention is given to wettability regulation in porous materials such as molecular sieves, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs), and single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), emphasizing its effect on improving mass transport and confinement effects. The materials used for superwetting catalysts design are summarized. Finally, future directions, including large&#8208;scale fabrication of superwetting membrane reactors, dynamic wettability tuning under operational conditions, and advanced in situ characterization techniques to capture real&#8208;time triple&#8208;phase interfacial phenomena, are outlined. These advancements are poised to expand the application of superwetting catalysts in sustainable energy, environmental remediation, and industrial catalysis, addressing key challenges in multiphase reaction systems.

         <title>A Metabolism&#8208;Oriented Strategy to Directly Generate Photosensitizer&#8208;Engineered Extracellular Vesicles from Cancer Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and effective metabolic approach utilizing glucose&#8208;modified photosensitizer as substrate is employed for the in situ biosynthesis of engineered extracellular vesicles (EVs) enriched with photosensitizers. This strategy offers increased yield and high labeling efficiency of engineered EVs. Moreover, the extracted engineered EVs exhibite excellent targeting ability and superior photodynamic therapy efficacy for inducing tumor ablation.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) hold great potential for delivering cancer therapy drugs. However, limited efficiency and sophisticated drug encapsulation procedures have hindered their effectiveness. Herein, &#946;&#8208;D&#8208;glucose is modified with the synthesized photosensitizer (1&#8208;(4&#8208;carboxybutyl)&#8208;4&#8208;(7&#8208;(4&#8208;(diphenylamino)phenyl)benzo[c][1,2,5] thiadiazol&#8208;4&#8208;yl)pyridin&#8208;1&#8208;ium, named TB) via amide bond to form a glucose&#8208;conjugated photosensitizer, referred to as TBG, which is further utilized as a metabolic substrate for cancer cells. Through simple co&#8208;incubation with TBG, cancer cells directly generate TBG&#8208;engineered EVs in situ via a metabolism&#8208;driven process, in which glucose transporters play a critical role. Notably, a higher yield of engineered EVs is observed in TBG&#8208;treated cells compared to the TB&#8208;treated group. This enhancement could be attributed to increased glucose transporter activity and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthesis, highlighting the significance of glucose&#8208;modified chemicals. Remarkably, this metabolism&#8208;driven strategy has been successfully validated across three cell lines, highlighting its versatility and broad applicability. The extracted TBG&#8208;EVs maintain a strong targeting ability toward cancer cells and demonstrate enhanced efficacy in photodynamic therapy for tumor ablation. The study offers an alternative strategy to efficiently produce cargo&#8208;loading EVs via direct biological metabolism.

         <title>Recent Advances in Impurity&#8208;Induced Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights recent advances in organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), emphasizing the critical role of trace impurities. Their origins, mechanisms, and potential applications are discussed for RTP systems while underscoring the importance of purity analysis to avoid misinterpretations and ensure an accurate understanding of RTP mechanisms.








Abstract
Organic room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) materials with large Stokes shifts and prolonged afterglows are gaining increasing attention in a variety of applications, including displays, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, and bioimaging. However, achieving high&#8208;performance organic RTP remains challenging due to weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, rapid non&#8208;radiative decay, and unstable triplet excitons. Early studies focused on crystal engineering, as ordered lattices restrict molecular motion and stabilize triplet excitons. Analyzing crystal structures and packing provides valuable insights into intermolecular interactions, while theoretical calculations have clarified electronic structures, laying the foundation for rational RTP material design. However, recent findings suggest RTP in many single&#8208;component systems may arise from trace impurities, significantly influencing RTP properties. This discovery has greatly advanced the understanding of impurity&#8208;induced phosphorescence. This review systematically examines the role of impurities in RTP, detailing their origins from starting materials, solvents, and side reactions. It also explores how these identified impurities can serve as essential building blocks for designing new RTP materials. Finally, essential methods for evaluating compound purity, emphasizing the critical importance of rigorous analysis and validation are presented. Material purity plays a pivotal role in RTP research, as impurities can distort experimental data, potentially leading to misinterpretations that can impede advancements in understanding the underlying mechanisms.

         <title>Conjugation Pathway of Benzobisoxazoles in Polymer Donors Mediates the Charge Management and Enables Organic Solar Cells with Record Certified Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, the conjugation pathway isomerism of the benzobisoxazole (BBO) building block is systematically compared, by which a certified efficiency of 19.1% is obtained in corresponding all&#8208;polymer solar cells.








Abstract

Charge management plays a pivotal role in achieving high&#8208;performance bulk heterojunction (BHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs). In this study, two efficient polymer donors are designed, P[4,8]BBO and P[2,6]BBO, by regulating the conjugation pathways of benzobisoxazoles (BBO) through 4,8&#8208; and 2,6&#8208;linkages, respectively. Comparing to P[2,6]BBO, the isomer of conjugation pathway has been proved to enable P[4,8]BBO a shallower highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) energy level of &#8722;5.20 eV, significantly enhanced luminescence efficiency, and reduced aggregation property. These improvements lead to a dramatic increase in device efficiencies from 2.6% for P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl to 19.0% for P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl. The combined characterizations show that a better comprehensive charge management can be reached in P[4,8]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based OSCs, yielding a significantly higher short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF) parameters compared to P[2,6]BBO:eC9&#8208;2Cl&#8208;based&#160;ones. Furthermore, P[4,8]BBO demonstrates good applicability and can achieve an impressive efficiency of 19.4% in all&#8208;polymer solar cells with a third&#8208;party certified efficiency of 19.1%. This work highlights the critical role of conjugation pathway isomerism in mediating polymeric properties and advancing the development of high&#8208;performance multifunctional photovoltaic materials.

A gel microneedle bioelectrodes device, with the enzymatic biofuel cells&#8208;based monitor strategy, wireless data capture and visualization model. This&#160;devices can track the physiological activities of diabetic rats within 180&#160;min. This device has potential in the fields of vital signs observation and AI&#8208;assisted monitoring and treatment integration equipment, opens new avenues for proactive disease management and personalized treatment strategies.








Abstract
Implementation of an enzymatic biofuel cell&#8208;based wearable device for the self&#8208;powered monitoring of dynamic biomarkers in interstitial fluid is crucial for precision medicine. Such devices are mainly limited by unimpaired immobilization and electron transformation of enzymes on electrode. Here, a gel microneedles bioelectrode utilized is designed by interfacial enzymatic polymerization from the aligned carbon fibers for initiating rigid gel shell array on surface, ensuring intact encapsulation of three oxidases with efficient substrate osmosis. Carbon nanotubes are employed to bridge each carbon fiber with the oxidase, accelerating the electrons transfer from active center of enzyme to external circuit. This strategy, which achieves a maximum power density of 1.98&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 at 20&#160;mm glucose as biofuel cell, with glucose detection limits as low as 0.2&#160;mm. Similarly, the detection limits for lactic acid and uric acid can be as low as 0.2 and 0.05&#160;mm. Validation in diabetic rats with the integration of data capture and an AI&#8208;assisted analyst system, enables precise detection of stimuli, such as food intake and exercise, allowing for the accurate prediction of biomarker dynamics in the next 20&#160;min. This integrated system marks a significant stride toward the realization of truly personalized and responsive healthcare solutions.

         <title>Charge Transport and Carrier Polarity Tuning by Electrolyte Gating in Nickel Benzenehexathiol Coordination Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals that charge transport in nickel benzenehexathiol coordination nanosheets is governed by variable&#8208;range hopping reflecting structural disorder. Electrolyte gating induces a switch in dominant carrier polarity from p&#8208;type to n&#8208;type and leads to an improvement in thermoelectric performance.








Abstract
Coordination nanosheets (CONASHs) or conjugated metal organic frameworks (MOFs) with distinctive metal&#8208;organic bonding structures exhibit promise for electronics, sensing, and energy storage. Porous Nickel&#8208;Benzene hexathiol complex (Ni&#8208;BHT) with noteworthy conductivity was first reported a decade ago, and recent synthetic modifications produced non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT with enhanced conductivity (&#8776;50 S cm&#8722;1). Here the charge transport physics of such non&#8208;porous Ni&#8208;BHT films are studied with even higher conductivity (&#8776;112 S cm&#8722;1). In contrast to the thermally activated electrical conductivity, thermoelectric measurements suggest an intrinsic metallic nature of Ni&#8208;BHT. It is shown that it is possible to tune the Fermi level and carrier polarity in Ni&#8208;BHT by electrolyte gating; gating is initially governed by the formation of an interfacial, electric double layer and then evolves into an electrochemical (de)doping process. These findings not only contribute to a deeper understanding of charge transport in CONASHs, but also show that Fermi level tuning is an effective approach for enhancing the thermoelectric performance of CONASHs.

         <title>Engineering Red Blood Cells for Amplified Tumor Dual&#8208;Gas Transfusion Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Red blood cells (RBCs) are nano/gas&#8208;engineered for tumor dual&#8208;gas (CO and NO) transfusion therapy. The engineered RBCs release dual&#8208;gas in tumor cell to amplify ROS and RNS production through HbFe2&#8314;&#8208;mediated catalysis, disrupting glycometabolism and reshaping tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment for effective treatment with biosafety. When combined with tumor cell membrane engineering, this strategy enables personalized therapy and suppresses metastatic in synergy with &#945;PD&#8208;L1.








Abstract
Red blood cell (RBC) transfusion therapy constitutes a vital medical intervention primarily aimed at enhancing oxygen delivery. Furthermore, RBCs possess the ability to stably bind therapeutic gas molecules such as carbon monoxide (CO) and nitric oxide (NO). As natural gas carriers, RBCs have the potential to mitigate the non&#8208;specific gas release and biosafety issues associated with conventional gas donors, which currently hinder the clinical application of gas therapy. In this study, RBCs are innovatively engineered for amplified tumor dual&#8208;gas transfusion therapy. The RBCs delivering CO and NO are developed using advanced nano&#8208; and gas&#8208;engineering techniques. These engineered RBCs are activated by tumor cell&#8208;specific&#160;hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) to release gases, and it induces a cascade amplification of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive nitrogen species (RNS) (ONOO&#8722;) production through the catalytic action of the ferrous hemoglobin (HbFe2+). This process disrupts glycometabolism and reshapes the tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment, thereby enhancing therapeutic efficacy. By integrating tumor cell membrane engineering, this approach enables targeted, personalized therapy and effectively suppresses metastatic tumors synergistically with &#945;PD&#8208;L1. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that engineered RBC&#8208;based amplified tumor dual&#8208;gas transfusion therapy exhibits excellent biosafety, and holds significant potential as a highly translatable and promising cancer treatment modality.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

         <title>Modular Molecular Editing of End&#8208;of&#8208;Life PBT for High&#8208;Performance Sustainable and 3D&#8208;Printable Platforms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by DNA editing, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to upcycle end&#8208;of&#8208;life poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT) into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable, and 3D&#8208;printable platform. Surpassing commercial counterparts in mechanical properties without additives, it enables programmable performance for applications like 3D materials, films, and fibers. This work provides an industrializable and sustainable solution for PBT upcycling, delivering environmental and economic benefits.









Abstract
Engineering polyesters, particularly poly(butylene terephthalate) (PBT), are widely used but generate significant waste, with limited recycling options. Existing mechanical and chemical recycling strategies struggle to sustainably and efficiently reuse PBT, resulting in product performance degradation and making the recycling process more costly than the upstream synthesis routes for raw materials. Inspired by DNA editing technologies in molecular biology, a modular molecular editing strategy is proposed to sequentially modify the backbone and end groups of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PBT, transforming it into a high&#8208;performance, sustainable, and 3D&#8208;printable poly(butylene adipate&#8208;co&#8208;terephthalate) (PBAT) platform. Unlike traditional commercial PBATs that produce only single components, this platform surpasses them in tensile strength and toughness without requiring additional additives and features programmable properties for diverse applications, including injection&#8208;molded parts, 3D&#8208;printed components, films, packaging, fibers, and fabrics. The industrial scalability of this strategy is validated through successful 100&#8208;L pilot&#8208;scale production. The resulting PBAT allows closed&#8208;loop polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer recycling by reintroducing PBT or monomers, thereby enhancing its social sustainability. When recovery is no longer feasible, the materials remain ecologically sustainable through composting, avoiding harmful environmental accumulation. This work achieves a direct polymer&#8208;to&#8208;polymer conversion of end&#8208;of&#8208;life PBT into high&#8208;performance materials, with techno&#8208;economic analysis highlighting both environmental and economic advantages.

         <title>Hour&#8208;Level and Air&#8208;Stable Organic Long&#8208;Persistent Luminescence from Organic&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8211;inorganic material with air&#8208;stable organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) lasting over 20 h is obtained by immobilizing organic guests within inorganic B2O3&#8208;containing traps through hydrogen bonding. The charge carriers trapped/released by traps play an important role in the OLPL.









Abstract
Organic long&#8208;persistent luminescence (OLPL) materials show important application prospects in bioimaging due to their low biotoxicity and the ability to eliminate the interference of background fluorescence. However, OLPL materials suffer from poor environmental stability and short afterglow times. Herein, by introducing the phosphorescent guest 2, 3&#8208;naphthalimide (NAI) into the B2O3 (BO) matrix using a solvent&#8208;free method in an air atmosphere, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid material NAI/BO is obtained, exhibiting OLPL lasting for more than 20&#160;h, visible to the naked eye for up to 180&#160;min. Photoluminescence and thermoluminescence spectra reveal that the OLPL originates from pure phosphorescence of NAI, and is induced by inorganic defects generated by oxygen vacancies in BO. The NAI electrons in the excited state can be captured by the defect, then detrapped through the thermal activation process, and eventually returned to the triplet state of NAI, thereby achieving OLPL emission. NAI/BO is successfully applied in vivo imaging stimulated in vitro. In addition, the universality of this strategy is verified by changing the phosphorescent guest molecules, enabling the regulation of OLPL from green to orange&#8211;red light. These results provide an important foundation for the design and development of stable OLPL materials and the practical applications in biological imaging.

         <title>Efficient Organic D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A Scintillators for Temperature&#8208;Adaptive X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient organic D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A scintillators with temperature adaptability are presented, achieved through strategic fluorine atom modification of &#960;&#8208;bridge. These materials simultaneously exhibit TADF, AIDF, and RTP that dynamically respond to environmental changes under ultraviolet excitation. Their PLQYs can reach up to 88% in PMMA films. Notably, 1FAT@PMMA exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance, achieving a remarkably low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and an impressive spatial resolution of 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Achieving highly efficient organic scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging remains a significant challenge, primarily owing to the inherent difficulty in facilitating rapid radiative decays of both singlet and triplet excitons. To address this limitation, a novel design strategy is introduced that incorporated fluorine atoms to modify the &#960;&#8208;bridge of D&#8208;&#960;&#8208;A molecules, thereby fine&#8208;tuning their electronic structures and photophysical properties. The emitters, namely 1FAT and 2FAT, show excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), aggregation&#8208;induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF), and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) excited by ultraviolet light varying with surrounding environments. Notably, the doped PMMA film of 1FAT exhibites intense emission across a broad temperature range from 77 to 363 K, showcasing its adaptability to diverse thermal conditions. More importantly, 1FAT@PMMA film exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance under X&#8208;ray excitation with a low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&#8722;1 and a high spatial resolution of over 20 lp&#160;mm&#8722;1.

     alt="Efficient Organic D-&#960;-A Scintillators for Temperature-Adaptive X-Ray Imaging"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Efficient organic D-&#960;-A scintillators with temperature adaptability are presented, achieved through strategic fluorine atom modification of &#960;-bridge. These materials simultaneously exhibit TADF, AIDF, and RTP that dynamically respond to environmental changes under ultraviolet excitation. Their PLQYs can reach up to 88% in PMMA films. Notably, 1FAT@PMMA exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance, achieving a remarkably low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and an impressive spatial resolution of 20 lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving highly efficient organic scintillators for X-ray imaging remains a significant challenge, primarily owing to the inherent difficulty in facilitating rapid radiative decays of both singlet and triplet excitons. To address this limitation, a novel design strategy is introduced that incorporated fluorine atoms to modify the &#960;-bridge of D-&#960;-A molecules, thereby fine-tuning their electronic structures and photophysical properties. The emitters, namely 1FAT and 2FAT, show excellent thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), aggregation-induced delayed fluorescence (AIDF), and room temperature phosphorescence (RTP) excited by ultraviolet light varying with surrounding environments. Notably, the doped PMMA film of 1FAT exhibites intense emission across a broad temperature range from 77 to 363 K, showcasing its adaptability to diverse thermal conditions. More importantly, 1FAT@PMMA film exhibits excellent radioluminescence performance under X-ray excitation with a low detection limit of 62.27 nGy&#160;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and a high spatial resolution of over 20 lp&#160;mm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;. This study introduces a novel and fundamental design strategy for developing efficient, temperature-adaptive D-&#960;-A organic scintillators, significantly expanding their potential applications in flexible, stretchable X-ray detectors and advanced imaging technologies.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bioinspired Smart Nanogels for Rapid Blue Laser&#8208;Activated Hemostasis in Gastrointestinal Bleeding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Waxberry&#8208;inspired branched&#8208;silica nanogel can swiftly stop bleeding upon blue laser endoscopy for gastrointestinal hemostasis in the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini&#8208;pigs.








Abstract
Gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) is a critical condition that requires rapid and effective intervention. Although thrombin is a widely used hemostatic agent, its efficacy is limited in the harsh environment of the digestive tract, especially in patients with chronic liver disease or coagulation disorders. Current treatment techniques often fall short, particularly when faced with severe blood loss and coagulation challenges. Here, a novel solution: waxberry&#8208;inspired smart nanogels that offer a cost&#8208;effective, highly efficient, and mechanically stable approach for local hemostasis is presented. Drawing inspiration from the microfibrous structures of waxberry, a waxberry&#8208;like nano&#8208;silica with a radially fibrous structure is synthesized for effective thrombin loading and release upon emergency. This nano&#8208;silica, coated with GelMA, forms a stable nanogel network activated by blue laser during endoscopy. Within just 5 s, the nanogel effectively triggers coagulation, even in patients with coagulation disorders. The formed blood clots are stable enough to withstand the challenging conditions of the digestive tract, preventing secondary bleeding. Upon injection, thrombin rapidly converts fibrinogen to fibrin, creating a secondary network that reinforces clot stability. This dual&#8208;network system demonstrates strong adhesive properties and effective hemostasis in the blood of cirrhotic patients, as well as in gastrointestinal bleeding scenarios involving the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum of mini&#8208;pigs.

         <title>A Disordered Rock Salt Anode for Long&#8208;Lived All&#8208;Vanadium Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery using a novel disordered rock salt anode, DRS&#8208;NVO, delivers long life, fast charging, and high efficiency. This system retains 80% capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles, with over 93% energy efficiency. Combining low&#8208;cost materials with stable performance, it presents a scalable and recyclable solution for future grid&#8208;level energy storage.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries wherein both the cathode and the anode are vanadium&#8208;based phases are promising grid&#8208;energy storage candidates, offering long cycle life and easy recycling. However, their system&#8208;level energy density must be improved to lower their footprint and operating costs. In this work, an all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery that uses a new disordered rock salt (DRS) anode, Na3V2O5 (DRS&#8208;NVO), is proposed. For DRS&#8208;NVO, &#8776;2 Na+ ions can be reversibly cycled at &#8776;0.7&#160;V versus Na/Na+. Structural characterization by X&#8208;ray diffraction and pair distribution function (PDF) analysis reveal increased local distortions during Na+ insertion but the overall DRS structure is maintained. The material shows exceptional stability and rate capability, achieving 10&#160;000 cycles in half&#8208;cell tests at rates of up to 20 C. Molecular dynamics simulations produce voltage profiles and ion diffusivities in good agreement with experimental results. Pairing the DRS&#8208;NVO anode with a Na3V2(PO4)3 (NVP) cathode yields a cell (NVO|NVP) voltage of 2.7&#160;V, with symmetric voltage profiles and an energy efficiency &gt;93%. This all&#8208;vanadium sodium&#8208;ion battery exhibits excellent cycling stability, retaining 80% of its capacity after 3&#160;000 cycles. Levelized cost&#8208;of&#8208;storage (LCOS) evaluations based on a cell design model confirm the cost&#8208;effectiveness, positioning NVO|NVP as a competitive grid&#8208;scale energy storage solution.

         <title>De Novo Design of Efficient NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Activated Heavy&#8208;Atom&#8208;Free Type&#8208;I Photosensitizer for Anti&#8208;Tumor Photoimmunotherapy</title>

         <dc:description>
A series of heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free NIR&#8208;I&amp;II activated photosensitizers (PSs) based on boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY) derivatives are synthesized via a de novo design strategy. Upon 1064&#160;nm laser irradiation, CTU3 NPs show highly efficient 7.8&#8208;fold enhancement in type&#8208;I reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation that is higher than the reported type&#8208;I PS, resulting in irreversible cytotoxicity to tumor tissue and distinct solid tumor ablation and triggered immunogenic cell death (ICD) within tumors.








Abstract
Type&#8208;I photosensitizers (PSs) are considered to be efficient agents for overcoming the oxygen&#8208;dependent deficiency of traditional photodynamic therapy (PDT). However, it is still challenging to design type&#8208;I PSs that can be activated by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) irradiation. Herein, a series of organic heavy&#8208;atom&#8208;free molecules are designed (named as CTU1, CTU2, and CTU3) and exhibit strong absorption bands over the first near&#8208;infrared and NIR&#8208;II regions. Among them, water&#8208;dispersible CTU3 nanoparticles (NPs) show strong J&#8208;aggregate characteristics and a good NIR&#8208;II absorption band, resulting in highly efficient &#8226;O2&#8722; generation upon irradiation of 1064&#160;nm light. In addition, the CTU3 NPs also exhibit a high photothermal conversion efficiency of 88.6%. In vitro and in vivo experiments show that CTU3 NPs have superior PDT and photothermal therapy (PTT) effects, which can further induce immunogenic cell death and activate immune cells in 4T1 tumor&#8208;bearing mice for combined PDT/PTT anti&#8208;tumor photoimmunotherapy against refractory tumors. This work presents a paradigm of de novo design of NIR&#8208;II light&#8208;activated type&#8208;I PS for combinational photoimmunotherapy of cancer.

         <title>Cracked Metal&#8211;Phenolic Networks with Durable Confinement Capillarity for Enhanced Solar Desalination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nature&#8208;inspired cracks are introduced into photothermal metal&#8211;phenolic networks (C&#8208;MPNs). These crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water flow, enabling confinement capillarity to enhance the evaporation rate while preventing salt fouling. The cracks also serve as a buffer zone to significantly enhance the stability of the C&#8208;MPNs, overcoming the bottleneck for the practical applications of confinement capillarity.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial desalination is a promising strategy to address freshwater shortages. Water evaporation can be enhanced through confinement capillarity by generating ultra&#8208;thin water layers on the internal surfaces of porous photothermal materials. However, realizing confinement capillarity relies on coatings composed of aggregated nanospheres, which likely detach under mechanical compression, limiting their practical application. Herein, nature&#8208;inspired crack patterns are introduced into adhesive photothermal supramolecular materials, metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings, forming C&#8208;MPNs to achieve durable confinement capillarity. The crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water transport through narrow channels, enhancing the evaporation rate from 1.6 to 3.3 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 while preventing salt accumulation during seawater desalination. Furthermore, the cracks serve as buffer zones, significantly improving the mechanical stability of C&#8208;MPN coatings under compression (exhibiting negligible change after 300 cycles)&#8212;overcoming a key challenge that has hindered the practical application of confinement capillarity. Furthermore, due to the enhanced confinement capillarity in C&#8208;MPNs, high evaporation performance is sustained even as the size of the photothermal material increases&#8212;a rare characteristic among 3D photothermal materials. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of photothermal coatings with confinement capillarity, paving the way for their application in solar desalination.

&lt;p&gt;Solar-driven interfacial desalination is a promising strategy to address freshwater shortages. Water evaporation can be enhanced through confinement capillarity by generating ultra-thin water layers on the internal surfaces of porous photothermal materials. However, realizing confinement capillarity relies on coatings composed of aggregated nanospheres, which likely detach under mechanical compression, limiting their practical application. Herein, nature-inspired crack patterns are introduced into adhesive photothermal supramolecular materials, metal&#8211;phenolic network coatings, forming C-MPNs to achieve durable confinement capillarity. The crack patterns can be controlled to optimize water transport through narrow channels, enhancing the evaporation rate from 1.6 to 3.3 kg m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; while preventing salt accumulation during seawater desalination. Furthermore, the cracks serve as buffer zones, significantly improving the mechanical stability of C-MPN coatings under compression (exhibiting negligible change after 300 cycles)&#8212;overcoming a key challenge that has hindered the practical application of confinement capillarity. Furthermore, due to the enhanced confinement capillarity in C-MPNs, high evaporation performance is sustained even as the size of the photothermal material increases&#8212;a rare characteristic among 3D photothermal materials. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of photothermal coatings with confinement capillarity, paving the way for their application in solar desalination.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes the topological structures in biological piezoelectric materials, covering morphology evolution, spatial arrangement, and biomimetic strategies. These topologies modulate structure&#8208;property relationships across multiple scales, enabling performance enhancement and multifunctional integration. Insights into topology&#8208;guided optimization and growing applications in biosensing, health monitoring, energy harvesting, and disease treatment are provided, along with challenges for future research directions.








Abstract
Topology is fundamental in determining the properties and functions of biological piezoelectric materials by influencing service performances across multiple scales, from nanoscale molecular arrangements to macroscopic assembly structures. At each scale, topology governs electrical, mechanical, and biological behaviors, facilitating multifunctional integration and multi&#8208;field coupling advances. Recent progress demonstrates the potential of topological optimization to enhance piezoelectric coefficients and enable complex functionalities. Strategies such as multi&#8208;scale design, machine learning&#8208;guided optimization, and precision fabrication techniques are being explored to address persistent challenges, including limited energy conversion efficiency, long&#8208;term stability, and biocompatibility. Critical applications include health monitoring, biosensing, energy harvesting, and disease treatment, highlighting opportunities and unresolved technical bottlenecks. Future research directions are discussed to present theoretical insights and practical pathways to the development of biological piezoelectric materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Charging Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes Activated Pyroptosis for Antitumor Immunotherapy via Bioorthogonal Disruption of Succination and Reinvigorating T Lymphocytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In order to enhance tumor immunogenicity, reshape the immune microenvironment, and consume immunosuppressive metabolites, an ultrasound&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based single&#8208;atom nanozyme with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate that can serve as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhance antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis and reinvigorating T lymphocytes, is constructed.








Abstract
Pyroptosis can trigger strong immunogenic cell death (ICD) of tumor cells for antitumor immunotherapy. However, metabolic disorders of fumarate in the tumor microenvironment (TME) can significantly reduce the pyroptosis rate and render T lymphocytes dysfunctional. Here, the ultrasound (US)&#8208;driven piezoelectric charges assisted Fe&#8208;based SAzyme (BFTM) with co&#8208;loaded triphenylphosphonium (TPP) and methyl (Z)&#8208;4&#8208;(chloro(2&#8208;phenylhydrazono)methyl)benzoate (MMB, a bioorthogonal reagent of fumarate) for activating pyroptosis and regulating fumarate metabolism is developed. Positive and negative charges generated by barium titanate (BTO) regulate the electron cloud density of single&#8208;Fe atom, endowing the BFTM with efficient reactive oxygen species (ROS) production ability for triggering caspase&#8208;1 related gasdermin D (GSDMD) mediated pyroptosis. Meanwhile, the consumption of intracellular fumarate through bioorthogonal reaction not only prevented the succinate of cysteines in GSDMD, causing it to be activated and oligomerized by caspase&#8208;1 to enhance pyroptosis but also restored the phosphorylation of ZAP70 to normalize the T cell receptor (TCR) signaling pathways for reinvigorating CD8+ T cells. In short, US&#8208;driven BFTM as a pyroptosis initiator and metabolism immune activator significantly enhances antitumor immunotherapy effects via ROS storms, fumarate depletion, triggering pyroptosis, and reinvigorating T lymphocytes.

         <title>Local Recruitment of Autologous Stem Cells via a Targeting Microgel for Precise Cartilage Repair without Surgery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An antibody&#8208;modified hydrogel microsphere containing TGF&#946; affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is designed and synthesized to precisely target multiple scattered cartilage injury sites in advanced osteoarthritis. It can locally capture endogenous TGF&#946; to recruit bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells and promote their differentiation into chondrocytes, thereby achieving precise hyaline cartilage repair in vivo without surgery.








Abstract
The treatment of advanced osteoarthritis (OA) remains clinically intractable due to the inability to regenerate multifocal cartilage defects, stemming from poor targeted recruitment of bone marrow&#8208;derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) and the absence of a sustained chondrogenic microenvironment at the injury sites. In this work, an antibody&#8208;mediated gelatin methacrylate&#8208;based hydrogel microsphere modified by TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides (TRG microsphere) is developed, to precisely target and repair scattered cartilage injuries by only intraarticular injection without any surgical assistance. By leveraging the specific expression of type I collagen in OA cartilage lesions, the type I collagen antibodies anchoring on TRG's surface enable the specific and accurate targeting of the multiple injury areas that need regeneration. In the meantime, the TGF&#946;&#8208;affinity peptides incorporated in the TRG microsphere can capture the endogenous TGF&#946;, a growth factor that can recruit BMSCs and promote their differentiation, to precisely induce the hyaline&#8208;like cartilage regeneration locally. In a rat model of advanced OA, a single intra&#8208;articular injection of TRG microspheres can repair scattered cartilage defects, restore glycosaminoglycan deposition, and alleviate joint dysfunction. This study proposes an injection&#8208;based strategy that enables continuous recruitment of endogenous BMSCs for precise cartilage regeneration, eliminating complex invasive procedures and patient discomfort.

         <title>Breaking the Vicious Spiral to Suppress Oxygen Loss in Li&#8208;Rich Oxide Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of oxygen loss/redox in layered Li&#8322;MnO&#8323; and spinel Li&#8324;Mn&#8325;O&#8321;&#8322; is comparatively studied. The nanovoids as a result of the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and TM migration, facilitate O2 release in Li2MnO3, whereas O2 is trapped in stable Li4Mn5O12. Unraveling the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox reversibility sheds light on designing of advanced oxide cathode materials.








Abstract
The irreversible oxygen loss (O&#8208;loss) hinders the application of oxygen redox (O&#8208;redox) cathode material in high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li/Na&#8208;ion batteries. Although O&#8208;loss is commonly associated with O2 release, the underlying mechanism remains unclear, which is not a simple surface problem. Herein, the O&#8208;loss/redox behaviors of the layered Li2MnO3 and spinel Li4Mn5O12 are comparatively investigated through experiments and density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations. It shows that the vicious spiral between O&#9472;O dimerization and Mn migration drive the void growth, chain&#8208;like structural collapse, and O2 release in Li2MnO3. In contrast, the stable spinel framework and inert O in O&#8208;LiMn3 coordination of Li4Mn5O12 break this spiral and trap O2 within the bulk, ensuring a reversible O&#8208;redox. By atomically compositing Li4Mn5O12 with LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a novel Co&#8208;free Li&#8208;rich spinel oxide (LRSO) with high energy density (&gt;1000&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) is produced. These findings clarify the correlation between structural rearrangement and O&#8208;redox and contribute to the design of advanced O&#8208;redox cathode materials.

         <title>Rational Development of a Novel Emulgel Adjuvant for Single&#8208;Shot Effective Vaccination: A Multivariate Analysis Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using multivariate analysis, a novel emulgel adjuvant is developed by combining key nanoemulsion formulation variables&#8211;hydrogel trapping, small globule size, and mannide monooleate surfactant&#8211;achieving 10&#215; greater immunogenicity than MF59 in mice after a single shot. The emulgel matched Freund's adjuvant in immunogenicity and efficacy, ensured safety, and offers promise for single&#8208;dose vaccines, advancing adjuvant design and pandemic preparedness.








Abstract
Nanoemulsions, like MF59, are potent vaccine adjuvants due to their immunogenicity, scalability, stability, and generation of broad cross&#8208;clade neutralizing immune responses, facilitating their feasibility for pandemic preparedness. However, they are unsuitable for single&#8208;shot applications due to limited immunogenicity with subunit antigens, and need to be explored for key immunogenic formulation variables like surfactant type, antigen anchoring, oil&#8208;globule solidification, hydrogel polymer trapping, or globule size. Here, a multivariate analysis approach is used for the first time in adjuvant development, selecting 14 formulations from over 150, each with a unique formulation variable, to evaluate their immunological properties on C57BL/6 mice. Results show that nanoemulsions with hydrogel trapping, smaller globule size, or mannide monooleate cosurfactant significantly enhance immunogenicity, each by 5&#8208;to&#8208;10 folds over MF59. For the first time, these formulation variables are combined into an &#8220;optimized emulgel&#8221; that is predicted to maximize immunogenicity after a single shot, model fit gave (R2 = 0.97). The optimized emulgel triggers long&#8208;lasting immune responses matching both the model's prediction and those triggered by the gold&#8208;standard Freund's adjuvant against various antigens, while maintaining excellent safety. The findings highlight the potential of emulgels as a novel adjuvant class and underscore the utility of multivariate analysis in adjuvant design.

         <title>Amorphous Phosphates Tailor Local Proton Supply for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A balanced proton supply improves electrochemical hydrogen evolution performance without causing proton aggregation or electron wastage. This is made by a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept electrode design, where the key feature is a multi&#8208;role proton&#8208;managing amorphous phosphate species that facilitates active hydrogen/proton generation, buffers excess protons without local pile&#8208;up, and transfers protons to H&#8208;consuming CoP rapidly.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H2) is irreplaceable as a feedstock in varied industrial scenarios, and alkaline water electrolysis allows for H2 production without costly proton exchange membrane and noble metals with limited reserves. However, alkaline solution is devoid of directly available protons, leading to suboptimal electrochemical H2&#8208;evolving kinetics even on catalysts with high intrinsic activities like CoP. On the other hand, high local acidity (i.e., superfluous protons) can lead to undesirable catalyst corrosion and active site blocking by excessive hydrogen coverage. Herein, a &#8220;cobalt phosphate&#8208;clothed&#8208;CoP (CoPi@CoP)&#8221; nanoarray catalyst is developed for proof of concept to explore a possible proton supply design principle. The nanometer&#8208;thick amorphous CoPi appears to serve multiple functions: facilitating water dissociation/H&#8211;O cleavage, buffering excess protons, and accelerating proton transfer/donation, thus optimizing the local proton supply to H&#8208;consuming sites. As expected, CoPi@CoP demonstrates state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hydrogen evolution reaction performance in alkaline electrolytes, surpassing that of intrinsically active CoP. Online differential mass spectrometry, dynamic potential decay transients, spectroscopy data, and theoretical calculations reveal possible (atomic scale) reaction mechanisms.

         <title>Siliconizing&#8208;Driven Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Growth of 2D Tellurides with Controlled Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the strategy for preparing large&#8208;area 2D zirconium tellurides through a siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth process. The use of Si&#8208;Te precursor in this strategy, instead of conventional Te source, enhances the growth controllability of 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 single crystals such as layer thickness and crystallinity. The findings facilitate wafer&#8208;scale 2D tellurides for spintronic applications.








Abstract
2D transition metal tellurides (TMTs) possess fascinating properties for applications in ferroelectrics and optoelectronics. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to grow high&#8208;quality 2D TMTs with the desired phase (especially high&#8208;temperature phase) because of the weak bonding between the transition metal and Te as compared to S and Se atoms. Here, a strategy of siliconizing&#8208;driven layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth is reported to synthesize 2D ZrTe2 and ZrTe3 crystals with high crystallinity and desired thickness. Both as&#8208;synthesized crystals exhibit large&#8208;area uniform phases and atomically precise layered stacking structures. 2D ZrTe2 shows type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal characteristics with negative magnetoresistance, and 2D ZrTe3 demonstrates the existence of charge density waves and intrinsic superconductivity. Theoretical study reveals that silicon atoms can infiltrate and isolate a single layer of zirconium atoms and allow them to be tellurized in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer manner. The work paves the way for the synthesis of layer&#8208;controlled 2D TMTs and lays a material foundation for their physical property research.

         <title>Dynamic Magnonic Crystals Based on Spatiotemporal Plasmon Excitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterials enabling spatiotemporal optical control of spin&#8208;wave transport are demonstrated. These structures integrate periodic stripes of gold nanodisk arrays with low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet films to realize dynamically reconfigurable magnonic crystals. By utilizing localized thermoplasmonic heating, induced by short laser pulses, the system achieves active modulation of the magnonic band structure, including the formation of bandgaps and minibands.








Abstract
Metamaterials, designed to exhibit properties beyond those found in nature, enable unprecedented control over physical phenomena through flexible band structure engineering. This work introduces a hybrid magnonic&#8208;plasmonic metamaterial that allows spatiotemporal manipulation of spin&#8208;wave transport at micrometer scales and sub&#8208;microsecond timescales. The system integrates a plasmonic metamaterial, comprising Au nanodisk arrays arranged in a 1D periodic stripe pattern, with a low&#8208;damping yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film as the spin&#8208;wave transport medium. Short laser pulses (100&#8722;500 ns) excite surface lattice resonances (SLRs) in the plasmonic stripes, inducing thermoplasmonic heating and generating a striped temperature profile. This dynamic thermal modulation periodically alters the YIG film's saturation magnetization, forming a laser&#8208;controlled magnonic crystal. Time&#8208;resolved propagating spin&#8208;wave spectroscopy reveals tunable bandgaps and minibands arising from Bragg reflection. By adjusting the plasmonic stripe pattern, laser pulse duration, or power, this system enables precise control over spin&#8208;wave transport, paving the way for reconfigurable wave&#8208;based computing&#160;devices.

         <title>Tailoring Robust Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect via Entropy&#8208;Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bandstructure renormalization, without (w/o) spin&#8208;orbit interaction (SOI) (left) and with SOI (right), in the low&#8208;energy Dirac bands of zero&#8208;entropy (purple) and entropic (green) VCl3 monolayer (ML) with long&#8208;range ordering (LRO). 








Abstract
The development of quantum materials and the tailoring of their functional properties is of fundamental interest in materials science. Here, a new design concept is proposed for the robust quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect via entropy engineering in 2D magnets. As a prototypical example, the configurational entropy of monolayer transition metal trihalide VCl3 is manipulated by incorporating four different transition&#8208;metal cations [Ti,Cr,Fe,Co] into the honeycomb structure made of vanadium, such that all in&#8208;plane mirror symmetries, inversion and/or roto&#8208;inversion are broken. Monolayer VCl3 is a ferromagnetic Dirac half&#8208;metal&#160;in which spin&#8208;polarized Dirac dispersion at valley momenta is accompanied by bulk states at the &#915;&#8208;point and thus the spin&#8208;orbit interaction&#8208;driven QAH&#160;phase does not exhibit fully gapped bulk band dispersion. Entropy&#8208;driven bandstructure renormalization, especially band flattening in combination with red&#8208; and blue&#8208;shifts at different momenta of the Brillouin zone and crystal&#8208;field effects, transforms Dirac half&#8208;metal to a Dirac spin&#8208;gapless semiconductor and leads to a robust QAH phase with fully gapped bulk band dispersion and, thus, a purely topological edge state transport without mixing with dissipative bulk channels. These findings provide a paradigm for designing entropy&#8208;engineered 2D materials for the realization of robust QAH effect and quantum device&#160;applications.

         <title>Advances in Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution Coupled with Alcohol and Aldehyde Oxidation: Mechanistic Insights and Economic Feasibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the synergistic integration of hydrogen evolution reactions with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions is explored to enhance H2 production efficiency. It examines reaction mechanisms, catalytic pathways, and energy advantages over conventional water splitting. Additionally, it evaluates technoeconomic feasibility, highlighting industrial scalability and the potential for value&#8208;added chemical generation, supporting the transition to sustainable energy solutions.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic H2 generation via conventional water splitting is gaining attention, but challenges such as high overpotentials, energy demands, and slow kinetics limit its scalability. Here, a novel approach: coupling hydrogen evolution reactions (HER) with alcohol and aldehyde oxidation reactions (AAORs) is explored. This strategy decreases energy requirements, improves HER efficiency, and enables dual H2 generation. Additionally, it facilitates the cogeneration of valuable chemicals such as formate, acetate, and 2,5&#8208;furan dicarboxylic acid (FDCA), enhancing economic feasibility. A detailed analysis of alcohol and aldehyde oxidation mechanisms and their integration into electrocatalytic systems are provided here. Furthermore, it examines the technoeconomic advantages of HER coupled with AAORs, emphasizing cost efficiency and industrial scalability. It is aimed here to advance renewable energy technologies and optimize processes for large&#8208;scale H2 generation, contributing to a sustainable energy future by addressing these aspects.

         <title>Paving the Way for Next&#8208;Generation All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries: Dry Electrode Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dry&#8208;electrode process offers a highly efficient solution to the key challenges faced by all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including complex processing, high CO2 emissions, interfacial instability, toxicity, and limited energy density. This perspective outlines the critical challenges of implementing the dry electrode process from material fundamentals to processing, providing a guiding framework to bridge current research and future development.








Abstract
For the effective implementation of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), the progress of dry electrode technology is essential. Considering the urgent challenges posed by global warming, advancing affordable ASSBs is crucial for reliable and sustainable electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems. Despite the substantial progress in research on solid electrolytes, ASSBs continue to face fundamental challenges, including high manufacturing costs, considerable environmental impact, and insufficient interfacial stability. The dry electrode processing methodology presents a highly promising alternative to conventional wet electrode fabrication techniques, effectively addressing these limitations while facilitating scalable production capabilities. Although research on dry&#8208;electrode&#8208;based ASSBs has gained significant traction in recent years, the overall challenges are recognized as intricate due to the presence of multiple electrode components with diverse requirements and limitations. For the comprehensive review, the dry processing approach is systematically examined from the perspective of materials science and electrode processing. An electrode&#8208;component&#8208;level framework is adopted as well. Furthermore, crucial technical barriers are identified, and prospective research directions for the advancement of solid&#8208;state battery technology are delineated.

         <title>Highly Exposed Ultra&#8208;Small High&#8208;Entropy Sulfides with d&#8208;p Orbital Hybridization for Efficient Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;engineering design of ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy sulfides (HES) in carbon nanofibers synergizes d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and size effects, enabling efficient oxygen evolution with low overpotential (200&#160;mV) and ultrastable 300&#160;h operation. Electronic modulation via d&#8208;p orbital hybridization shifts the d&#8208;band center and redistributes interfacial charges, optimizing oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates adsorption and accelerating proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics.








Abstract
Precise regulation of electronic structure and nanoscale geometry represents a transformative strategy for breaking the activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off in oxygen evolution electrocatalysts. Here, highly exposed ultra&#8208;small high&#8208;entropy sulfides (HES, 5.2&#160;nm) confined in porous carbon nanofibers are designed. This structure involves a dual&#8208;engineering synergistic effect combining d&#8208;p orbital hybridization and nanoconfinement. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal hybridization between transition metal 3d orbitals and sulfur 3p orbitals. This orbital interaction induces a d&#8208;band center shift toward the Fermi level and facilitates interfacial charge redistribution, endowing HES with superior electron&#8208;donating capability to accelerate proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics. Such electronic modulation significantly optimizes the adsorption of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) intermediates (*OH, *O, *OOH). Experimentally, the HES demonstrates exceptional OER performance, exhibiting a low overpotential of 200&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and remarkable durability with negligible current decay during 300&#160;h operation across current densities ranging from 10 to 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work establishes a dual optimization strategy leveraging orbital hybridization engineering and size engineering for advanced electrocatalyst design, providing a new design approach in energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Direct Observation of Optically Active Mid&#8208;Gap Electronic States in Hexagonal Boron Nitride by Electron Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present work utilizes STEM&#8208;EELS for a direct visualization of defect mediated midgap electronic states (MESs) in hexagonal boron nitride and correlates these states with observed photoluminescence.








Abstract
Optically active point defects in wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors have been demonstrated to be attractive for a variety of quantum and nanoscale applications. In particular, color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) have recently gained substantial attention owing to their spectral tunability, brightness, stability, and room&#8208;temperature operation. Despite all of the recent studies, precise detection of the defect&#8208;induced mid&#8208;gap electronic states (MESs) and their simultaneous correlations with the observed emission in hBN remain elusive. Directly probing these MESs provides a powerful approach toward atomic identification and optical control of the defect centers underlying the sub&#8208;bandgap emission in hBN. Combining optical and electron spectroscopy, the existence of mid&#8208;gap absorptive features is revealed at the emissive sites in hBN, along with an atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom identification of the underlying defect configuration. The atomically resolved defect structure, primarily constituted by vacancies and carbon/oxygen substitutions, is further studied via first&#8208;principles calculations, which support the correlation with the observed MESs through the electronic density of states. This work provides a direct relationship between the observed visible emission in hBN, the underlying defect structure, and its absorptive MESs, opening venues for atomic&#8208;scale and optical control in hBN for quantum&#160;technology.

         <title>Tailored Design of Mesoporous Metal Organic Framework Single Crystals by Kinetics&#8208;Mediated Micelle Assembly for Efficient Asymmetrical Single&#8208;Atom Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is established for the controllable synthesis of mesoporous MOFs (MesoMOFs) with diverse compositions and mesophases. The customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment enables the creation of a new class of mesoporous asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysts rich in catalytically accessible CoN3O sites, with enhanced localized electrons around Co center and upshifted d&#8208;band center, for efficient oxygen reduction reaction (ORR).








Abstract
Constructing mesoporous metal organic frameworks (MesoMOFs) with customizable meso&#8208; and micro&#8208;environment is pivotal for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis, yet it is impeded by the strong self&#8208;growth tendency of MOFs. In this work, a novel kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly strategy is introduced to realize the general fabrication of mesoporous zeolitic imidazolate framework (ZIF) single crystals. Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo&#8208;electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics&#8208;mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self&#8208;growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory&#8208;Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN3O single&#8208;atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d&#8208;band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in a zinc&#8208;air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single&#8208;atom catalysis.

Spectroscopic characterizations and cryo-electron cryomicroscopy reveal that the strategic use of water accelerates the MOFs kinetics-mediated micelle assembly via enhancing ligand deprotonation, which suppresses the MOFs self-growth, facilitating the cooperative assembly of micelles and MOFs. Furthermore, the water amount can modulate the Flory-Huggins interaction parameters between the solvents and micelles, thereby precisely controlling the pore architectures from spherical, cylindrical to vesicular. Such versatile synthesis creates a new class of mesoporous asymmetric CoN&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O single-atom catalyst. Synchrotron spectral characterizations and theoretical calculations uncover that this asymmetric geometry localizes more electrons around Co center and upshift the d-band center, stabilizing O* intermediates and promoting the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Consequently, the asymmetric mesoporous catalyst exhibits a half-wave potential (0.91&#160;V in alkaline media) and a high power density (185&#160;mW cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in a zinc-air battery. This work provides a new approach for designing MesoMOFs for asymmetric single-atom catalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dopamine Dopes the Performance of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. The DACl SAM enhances interfacial contact, boosts power conversion efficiency, promotes uniform film formation, reduces defects, and enhances the long&#8208;term performance of perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The electron transport layer (ETL) is a crucial component of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) as it greatly influences their photovoltaic performance. Among various currently used ETL materials, SnO&#8322; stands out due to its unique advantages, including low&#8208;temperature fabrication and rapid electron extraction capability and excellent energy match of its conduction band edge with that of the commonly used perovskite formulations. However, the currently employed SnO&#8322; layers contain surface defects, such as hydroxyl groups and oxygen vacancies that impair the desired growth of highly crystalline and defect less perovskite films during solution processing of n&#8208;i&#8208;p type PSCs reducing their power conversion efficiency (PCE) and stability. Here, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is introduced of dopamine hydrochloride (DACl) on the SnO2 film, whose catechol moiety adheres strongly to the SnO2 surface, while its methylammonium groups template the growth of the perovskite layer. Introducing the dopamine SAM at the interface between the ETL and the perovskite increases substantially the solar&#8208;to&#8208;electric PCE while greatly enhancing the PSC stability. This findings demonstrate the surprising benefits of this well&#8208;known neurotransmitter for the photovoltaic performance of PSCs which this is rationalized here by DFT and ab initio molecular dynamics calculations.

         <title>Over Tenfold Increase in Current Amplification Due to Anisotropic Polymer Chain Alignment in Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to boost the IDS output of an OECT? Anisotropic polymer alignment along the channel direction enables a 13&#8208;fold increase in IDS. Such channel engineering opens the door to unprecedented signal amplification (here gmL/Wd = 2 580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 with a PBTTT&#8208;backbone bearing single&#8208;ether side chains), faster ON/OFF switching, and improved stability for the next&#8208;generation bioelectronics.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are central to the development of highly sensitive (bio)sensors, energy&#8208;efficient neuromorphic devices, and high&#8208;precision electrophysiological monitoring systems. With growing interest in these strategic electronic devices, a novel PBTTT polymer bearing single&#8208;ether side chains (PBTTT&#8208;8O) in OECTs is investigated. Pristine isotropic non&#8208;aligned OECT performance matches state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transconductance, highlighting the potential of single ethers for designing high&#8208;performance organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs). Moreover, a 13&#215; enhancement of current output is achieved by anisotropic polymer chain alignment of PBTTT&#8208;8O, opening doors to unprecedented device sensitivity. Compared to pristine ones, aligned OECTs afford a 6&#215; increase in the normalized transconductance (gmL/Wd), reaching an unprecedented 2&#160;580&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1. Such improvement is mainly due to a gain in carrier mobility &#181;, as evidenced by four distinct methods. In addition, aligned OECTs exhibit faster doping front propagation, ON switching, and OFF switching compared to pristine ones. This study hence reports a versatile and easily transferable approach to concomitantly boost signal amplification and accelerate the response time of bioelectronic devices.

         <title>Intensive Widmannst&#228;tten Nanoprecipitates Catalyze SnTe With State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intensive lath&#8208;shaped Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates are in situ generated in SnTe via AgPbSbTe3 alloying, and align with the formation of the parallel type and twin type interfaces. These Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity, resulting in a significantly enhanced average ZT, more suitable for mid&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Nanoprecipitates play a vital role in designing high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials, particularly for those with short phonon mean&#8208;free paths. However, their effectiveness in reducing lattice thermal conductivity is hindered by the uncontrollable intensity, poor interfacial coherence, and suboptimal morphology. To address these limitations, AgPbSbTe3 is used to alloy SnTe to form intensive Ag2Te Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates for obtaining state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art thermoelectric performance. Advanced microscopy characterizations reveal the crystallographic orientation relationships between SnTe and Ag2Te to guide the lath&#8208;shaped morphology of Ag2Te, leading to the formation of the high&#8208;intensity Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates, which effectively scatter phonons to reduce the lattice thermal conductivity. Togethering the optimized electrical properties through carrier concentration adjustment, band convergence, and the energy filtering effect, a maximum figure of merit ZT of 1.5 at 723 K and an average ZT of 1.1 between 423 and 823 K is achieved in (SnTe)0.80(Ag1.05PbSb0.95Te3)0.20, enabling a single&#8208;leg device and two&#8208;pair module with energy&#8208;conversion efficiency of 7.22% and 4.26% under a temperature difference of 450 K, respectively. The findings highlight the potential of intensive Widmannst&#228;tten nanoprecipitates as effective phonon scattering centers, providing a new pathway to enhance the thermoelectric performance of chalcogenides.

         <title>Revealing the Underlying Role of Li2CO3 in Enhancing Performance of Oxyhalide&#8208;Based Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) with oxyhalide electrolytes benefit from residual lithium compounds (RLCs) like Li&#8322;CO&#8323;, which enhance lithium ion mobility and interfacial dynamics. This study reveals untreated Ni&#8208;rich cathodes outperform washed ones, challenging conventional views of RLCs and offering insights to improve ASSB performance.









Abstract
Residual lithium compounds (RLCs) in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) employing Ni&#8208;rich cathode materials (LiNixCoyMnzO2, NCM) are traditionally viewed either as ionically and electronically insulating layers hindering electrochemical performance or as protective buffer layers enhancing cycling stability. In this study, a beneficial role of Li2CO3 in ASSBs featuring an oxyhalide&#8208;based AlOCl&#8208;2LiCl (LAOC) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) is revealed. ASSBs containing NCM with residual Li2CO3 demonstrate superior electrochemical performance compared to those treated with a washing pretreatment to remove Li2CO3. Solid&#8208;state nuclear magnetic resonance (ssNMR) spectroscopy shows that Li2CO3 facilitates spontaneous Li+ exchange at multiple sites within the LAOC SSE. This leads to faster ion mobility and shorter relaxation times at various lithium sites, indicating enhanced ion transport and improved interface dynamics. Moreover, the beneficial effects of Li2CO3 are confirmed in other halide&#8208;based ASSBs. This study uncovers an unexpected role for Li2CO3 in halide&#8208;based ASSBs, offering insights that may inspire further exploration of RLCs with functional properties for improving ASSBs performance.

         <title>Quantifying the Effects of Geometric Parameters on the Elastic Properties of Multilayer Graphene Platelet Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element models of multilayer graphene platelet films are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The obtained dimensionless results apply to different types of laminate or multi&#8208;layered materials such as MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre and seashells.








Abstract
Multilayer graphene platelet films (MGPFs) are widely studied for their exceptional mechanical, electrical, and chemical properties. The elastic properties and deformation mechanisms of MGPFs are highly sensitive to their geometric parameters, including graphene platelet size, graphene area fraction, and layer count. Despite extensive experimental and theoretical efforts, systematically quantifying these effects remains a significant challenge, severely hindering the design of high&#8208;performance MGPFs. Here, realistic random 3D periodic representative volume element (RVE) models of MGPFs are constructed to perform simulations, quantify the effects of different geometric parameters on all their five independent elastic properties, and uncover the dominant deformation mechanisms. The results reveal that the dimensionless platelet size, graphene area fraction, and number of platelet layers significantly affect the elastic properties, with detailed quantifications provided for their relationships. The effects of defects on the elastic properties are also explored, offering insights into the dominant deformation mechanisms. Validation against experimental data confirms that the developed RVE models and dimensionless results apply to various multilayer laminate composites, including MGPFs, MXene, graphene oxide films, and nacre&#8208;like materials. The findings provide a robust framework and pave the way for optimizing the design of MGPFs and other laminate composites, enabling their potential in diverse applications.

         <title>Vectorial Fluorescence Control with Light&#8208;Emitting Metasurfaces for Unidirectional Emission and Incoherent Holography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs) are constructed for unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside nanoprinting. Such LEM potentially paves the way for next&#8208;generation vectorial light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Ultracompact light emission manipulation is crucial for various applications, including illumination, biosensing, and quantum photonics. Despite significant advancements in lasing manipulation, achieving complex vectorial wavefront control over fluorescence emission is inherently challenging due to its incoherent, omnidirectional, unpolarized, and phase&#8208;random emission characteristics. Here, the light&#8208;emitting metasurfaces (LEMs), equipped with vectorial manipulation and complex amplitude encoding capabilities, are introduced to realize unidirectional emission and incoherent photoluminescence (PL) holography. Through engineering the interaction between the LEM and guided PL, the diffraction angle, linear polarization state, and emission intensity of PL unidirectional emission are independently controlled. Furthermore, the phase encoding capability of LEM, combined with the enhanced spatial coherence of guided PL, experimentally enabled vectorial PL holography alongside polarization&#8208;multiplexed nanoprinting. This versatile LEM platform provides a simplified approach to vectorial PL manipulation, promising multiple potential applications in nanophotonics and light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Heteronanoarchitecture of Ti3C2Tx MXene and Amorphous MOF for Exceptional Durability in Electro&#8208;Ionic Soft Actuator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nanoscale hybridization of MXene and amorphous metal&#8208;organic framework (MXene&#8211;aMOF) achieves exceptional electrochemical stability and ion storage capacity, attributed to the synergistic interplay between the nanoporous surfaces of aMOF and the metal&#8208;like electron conduction of MXene. This enhanced longevity of the MXene&#8208;aMOF electrode enables active morphing surfaces with reconfigurable dimensions and patterns, advancing applications in smart, adaptive materials.








Abstract
The assembly of 2D nanosheets with other functional nanomaterials enables the creation of materials with unique property combinations that cannot be achieved in single&#8208;phase materials. In particular, a combination of inorganic and organic components provides a pathway to structures offering highly durable ionic and electronic conductivity simultaneously. Here, a controlled growth of amorphous metal&#8211;organic framework (aMOF) in the interlayer spaces of Ti3C2Tx MXene for enhancing oxidation stability and accelerating fast ion transport is reported. The hydrophilic terminations of MXene provide support for the continuous growth of iron&#8208;based aMOF in the available interlayer 2D slits. Effective electronic interactions involving hydrogen bonding, coordination, and esterification in&#8208;between the open surfaces of MXene and nanoporous aMOF enhance the electrochemical strength of MXene&#8211;aMOF hybrid electrodes and allow the design of extremely durable electro&#8208;ionic soft actuators. The MXene&#8211;aMOF exhibits a fivefold increment in electroactuation compared to a conventional poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene)&#8208;poly(styrenesulfonate) soft actuator, with robust stability up to 50&#160;000 cycles in open air. Using the MXene&#8211;aMOF soft actuator, a deformable morphing surface with reversibly adjustable shapes and patterns is demonstrated.

         <title>Adhesively Bridging Co&#8208;Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer and Perovskite Via In Situ Polymerization for Enhanced Stability of Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembled monolayer with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. The polymerized layer at the interface enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds.








Abstract
The strategic utilization of self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) significantly advances the interfacial contact and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells (IPSCs). However, inadequate adhesion between the SAM and perovskite layer remains a critical challenge, limiting further performance enhancement. Herein, a synergistic interface engineering strategy is introduced that combines a co&#8208;assembly approach with in situ polymerization to optimize the buried interface of perovskite film. Specifically, 11&#8208;Mercaptoundecylphosphoric acid (MPA) is incorporated into a SAM to form co&#8208;SAMs, improving homogeneity and mitigating defects at the NiOx surface. Simultaneously, the ionic liquid (IL) monomer 1&#8208;Allyl&#8208;3&#8208;vinylimidazolium bis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl) imide (AVMTF2) is incorporated into the perovskite precursor. The aggregation of ILs cation at the bottom interface facilitates in situ polymerization via sulfhydryl end groups, forming the POL&#8208;AVM polymer at the perovskite/SAM interface. This polymer enhances interfacial adhesion, regulates perovskite crystallization, and reinforces structural integrity by strongly anchoring organic cations through multiple hydrogen bonds. As a result, this synergistic strategy achieves a champion PCE of 26.25% (certified 26.04%), along with excellent long&#8208;term stability, retaining 95.6% of its initial efficiency after 1000 h of continuous operation under the ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;2I protocol.

         <title>Liquid Metal&#8208;Vitrimer Conductive Composite for Recyclable and Resilient Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address the growing electronic waste challenge, an electrically conductive, healable, and recyclable plastic composite is created, composed of vitrimer and liquid metal microdroplets. A reconfigurable circuit board is demonstrated using this composite material, providing a notable step toward sustainable and robust electronic technologies.








Abstract
Electronic devices are ubiquitous in modern society, yet their poor recycling rates contribute to substantial economic losses and worsening environmental impacts from electronic waste (E&#8208;waste) disposal. Here, recyclable and healable electronics are reported through a vitrimer&#8208;liquid metal (LM) microdroplet composite. These electrically conductive, yet plastic&#8208;like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as&#8208;synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer&#8208;based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM&#8208;vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self&#8208;healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites. The vitrimer and LM&#8208;composite provide a pathway toward fully recyclable, mechanically robust, and reconfigurable electronics, thus advancing the field of electronic&#160;materials.

&lt;p&gt;To address the growing electronic waste challenge, an electrically conductive, healable, and recyclable plastic composite is created, composed of vitrimer and liquid metal microdroplets. A reconfigurable circuit board is demonstrated using this composite material, providing a notable step toward sustainable and robust electronic technologies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electronic devices are ubiquitous in modern society, yet their poor recycling rates contribute to substantial economic losses and worsening environmental impacts from electronic waste (E-waste) disposal. Here, recyclable and healable electronics are reported through a vitrimer-liquid metal (LM) microdroplet composite. These electrically conductive, yet plastic-like composites display mechanical qualities of rigid thermosets and recyclability through a dynamic covalent polymer network. The composite exhibits a high glass transition temperature, good solvent resistance, high electrical conductivity, and recyclability. The vitrimer synthesis proceeds without the need for a catalyst or a high curing temperature, which enables facile fabrication of the composite materials. The as-synthesized vitrimer exhibits a fast relaxation time with reconfigurability and shape memory. The electrically conductive composite exhibits high electrical conductivity with LM volume loading as low as 5 vol.%. This enables the fabrication of fully vitrimer-based circuit boards consisting of sensors and indicator LEDs integrated with LM-vitrimer conductive wiring. Electrical self-healing and thermally triggered material healing are further demonstrated with the composites. The vitrimer and LM-composite provide a pathway toward fully recyclable, mechanically robust, and reconfigurable electronics, thus advancing the field of electronic&#160;materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Infrared Photothermal Catalytic Reduction of Atmospheric CO2 Into CO with 100% Selectivity via Dual&#8208;Plasmon Resonance Conductor</title>

         <dc:description>
Schematic illustration of the designed environmentally friendly CO synthesis route from infrared&#8208;light&#8208;driven reduction of atmospheric CO2 over a dual&#8208;plasmonic photocatalyst, in which the dual&#8208;plasmonic effect helps to improve infrared region absorption and promotes carrier space separation, but also reduces CO2 reaction energy barrier.








Abstract
Today, the fabrication of carbon monoxide (CO) in industry customarily necessitates elevated temperature and pressure. Concurrently, the harnessing of infrared (IR) light, which constitutes &#8776;50% of solar energy, has predominantly remained unexploited due to a pronounced contradiction between the utilization of IR light and CO2 photoreduction. To break the above limitation, a dual&#8208;plasmon resonance conductor with a metallic nature is designed, which realizes the synthesis of CO with 100% selectivity from infrared photothermal catalytic reduction of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2). Taking the Au particles loaded Cu7Te4 nanowires as an example, the surface dual&#8208;plasmon resonance coupling effect can optimize the three critical processes of CO2 photoreduction, in which it is illustrated that the dual&#8208;plasmon resonance effect lowers the thermodynamic reaction energy barrier, facilitating the selective generation of CO products. Consequently, the Au&#8208;Cu7Te4 nanowires manifest a CO evolution rate of &#8776;2.7&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 100% selectivity for atmospheric CO2 reduction driven by IR light, several times higher than that of the Cu7Te4 nanowires.
