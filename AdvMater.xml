      <title>Polymer&#8208;Based Batteries&#8212;Flexible and Thin Energy Storage Systems</title>
      <dc:description>
The utilization of polymeric active materials within batteries enables the design and fabrication of flexible and thin energy storage systems. Moreover, these batteries can also feature very high power densities allowing charging/discharging within a few seconds to minutes. The properties of the utilized redox polymers can be tuned by the molecular structure.








Abstract
Batteries have become an integral part of everyday life&#8212;from small coin cells to batteries for mobile phones, as well as batteries for electric vehicles and an increasing number of stationary energy storage applications. There is a large variety of standardized battery sizes (e.g., the familiar AA&#8208;battery or AAA&#8208;battery). Interestingly, all these battery systems are based on a huge number of different cell chemistries depending on the application and the corresponding requirements. There is not one single battery type fulfilling all demands for all imaginable applications. One battery class that has been gaining significant interest in recent years is polymer&#8208;based batteries. These batteries utilize organic materials as the active parts within the electrodes without utilizing metals (and their compounds) as the redox&#8208;active materials. Such polymer&#8208;based batteries feature a number of interesting properties, like high power densities and flexible batteries fabrication, among many more.

      <title>Beyond What Meets the Eye: Imaging and Imagining Wood Mechanical&#8211;Structural Properties</title>
      <dc:description>
A review of the imaging of wood at various length scales is presented, showing how hierarchical properties are achieved and demonstrating unique levels of physical and mechanical performance.








Abstract
Wood presents a hierarchical structure, containing features at all length scales: from the tracheids or vessels that make up its cellular structure, through to the microfibrils within the cell walls, down to the molecular architecture of the cellulose, lignin, and hemicelluloses that comprise its chemical makeup. This structure renders it with high mechanical (e.g., modulus and strength) and interesting physical (e.g., optical) properties. A better understanding of this structure, and how it plays a role in governing mechanical and other physical parameters, will help to better exploit this sustainable resource. Here, recent developments on the use of advanced imaging techniques for studying the structural properties of wood in relation to its mechanical properties are explored. The focus is on synchrotron nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray tomographical imaging, Raman and infrared spectroscopies, confocal microscopy, electron microscopy, and atomic force microscopy. Critical discussion on the role of imaging techniques and how fields are developing rapidly to incorporate both spatial and temporal ranges of analysis is presented.

      <title>Stretchable Electronics Based on PDMS Substrates</title>
      <dc:description>
Elastic substrates, especially poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrates, are indispensable components for emerging stretchable electronics. Detailed design concepts and fabrication strategies for structured, patterned, and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates, and their contributions in enhancing the mechanical performance of stretchable electronics are discussed. Future perspectives and challenges in the development of stretchable and self&#8208;healing PDMS substrates are highlighted.








Abstract
Stretchable electronics, which can retain their functions under stretching, have attracted great interest in recent decades. Elastic substrates, which bear the applied strain and regulate the strain distribution in circuits, are indispensable components in stretchable electronics. Moreover, the self&#8208;healing property of the substrate is a premise to endow stretchable electronics with the same characteristics, so the device may recover from failure resulting from large and frequent deformations. Therefore, the properties of the elastic substrate are crucial to the overall performance of stretchable devices. Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) is widely used as the substrate material for stretchable electronics, not only because of its advantages, which include stable chemical properties, good thermal stability, transparency, and biological compatibility, but also because of its capability of attaining designer functionalities via surface modification and bulk property tailoring. Herein, the strategies for fabricating stretchable electronics on PDMS substrates are summarized, and the influence of the physical and chemical properties of PDMS, including surface chemical status, physical modulus, geometric structures, and self&#8208;healing properties, on the performance of stretchable electronics is discussed. Finally, the challenges and future opportunities of stretchable electronics based on PDMS substrates are considered.

      <title>Superior Carrier Lifetimes Exceeding 6 &#181;s in Polycrystalline Halide Perovskites</title>
      <dc:description>
Ultralong charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes &gt;6 &#956;s are achieved in polycrystalline halide perovskites by decorating the grain boundaries with a trace amount of electron&#8208;rich anchors, which benefits from weak excitonic effects and the weakening of electron&#8211;phonon couplings in passivated films, fulfilling reduced voltage deficits and enhanced efficiencies in perovskite photovoltaics. This finding provides a new insight into realizing superior carrier properties of polycrystalline perovskite films and high&#8208;performance perovskite optoelectronics.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite films have witnessed rapid progress in optoelectronic devices, whereas polycrystalline heterogeneities and serious native defects in films are still responsible for undesired recombination pathways, causing insufficient utilization of photon&#8208;generated charge carriers. Here, radiation&#8208;enhanced polycrystalline perovskite films with ultralong carrier lifetimes exceeding 6 &#956;s and single&#8208;crystal&#8208;like electron&#8211;hole diffusion lengths of more than 5 &#956;m are achieved. Prolongation of charge&#8208;carrier activities is attributed to the electronic structure regulation and the defect elimination at crystal boundaries in the perovskite with the introduction of phenylmethylammonium iodide. The introduced electron&#8208;rich anchor molecules around the host crystals prefer to fill the halide/organic vacancies at the boundaries, rather than form low&#8208;dimensional phases or be inserted into the original lattice. The weakening of the electron&#8208;phonon coupling and the excitonic features of the photogenerated carriers in the optimized films, which together contribute to the enhancement of carrier separation and transportation, are further confirmed. Finally the resultant perovskite films in fully operating solar cells with champion efficiency of 23.32% are validated and a minimum voltage deficit of 0.39 V is realized.

      <title>In Situ Topotactic Transformation of an Interstitial Alloy for CO Electroreduction</title>
      <dc:description>
Cu3N nanocrystals with a controlled density of twin structures are prepared through regulating the kinetics of crystal growth. Through in situ activation during the CO electroreduction, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations. Using a membrane electrode assembly electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte, high&#8208;concentration gas and liquid multi&#8208;carbon product streams are obtained simultaneously.








Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO to value&#8208;added products holds promise for storage of energy from renewable sources. Copper can convert CO into multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products during CO electroreduction. However, developing a Cu electrocatalyst with a high selectivity for CO reduction and desirable production rates for C2+ products remains challenging. Herein, highly lattice&#8208;disordered Cu3N with abundant twin structures as a precursor electrocatalyst is examined for CO reduction. Through in situ activation during the CO reduction reaction (CORR) and concomitant release of nitrogen, the obtained metallic Cu&#176; catalyst particles inherit the lattice dislocations present in the parent Cu3N lattice. The de&#8208;nitrified catalyst delivers an unprecedented C2+ Faradaic efficiency of over 90% at a current density of 727&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in a flow cell system. Using a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolyzer with a solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE), a 17.4 vol% ethylene stream and liquid streams with concentration of 1.45 m and 230&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m C2+ products at the outlet of the cathode and SSE&#8208;containment layer are obtained.

      <title>Versatile Phospholipid Assemblies for Functional Synthetic Cells and Artificial Tissues</title>
      <dc:description>
Phospholipids, with a hydrophilic head and two hydrophobic tails, are amphiphilic compounds capable of assembling into versatile membranous assemblies for the study of synthetic cells and artificial tissues. Current synthetic cell studies realize partial cell characteristics. It is imperative to increase hierarchical complexity of synthetic cells for a minimal cell with full life features.








Abstract
The bottom&#8208;up construction of a synthetic cell from nonliving building blocks capable of mimicking cellular properties and behaviors helps to understand the particular biophysical properties and working mechanisms of a cell. A synthetic cell built in this way possesses defined chemical composition and structure. Since phospholipids are native biomembrane components, their assemblies are widely used to mimic cellular structures. Here, recent developments in the formation of versatile phospholipid assemblies are described, together with the applications of these assemblies for functional membranes (protein reconstituted giant unilamellar vesicles), spherical and nonspherical protoorganelles, and functional synthetic cells, as well as the high&#8208;order hierarchical structures of artificial tissues. Their biomedical applications are also briefly summarized. Finally, the challenges and future directions in the field of synthetic cells and artificial tissues based on phospholipid assemblies are proposed.

      <title>Injectable and NIR&#8208;Responsive DNA&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Hydrogels with Outstanding Photothermal Therapy</title>
      <dc:description>
NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive and injectable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid hydrogels with high photothermal efficiency are fabricated. This is due to the formed network between the DNA and UCNP&#8208;Au nanoparticles. The ultrastrong photothermal effect in the system endows the soft material with extraordinary cancer therapy.

Abstract
Surgical excision is one of the main treatments for malignant tumors. However, high risk of tumour recurrence is a major challenge. Near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;light&#8208;induced tumor photothermal therapy has been studied, while its clinical applications are still restricted due to the limited therapeutic effects. To address this, here, a novel NIR&#8208;light&#8208;responsive and injectable DNA&#8208;mediated upconversion and Au nanoparticle hybrid (DNA&#8211;UCNP&#8208;Au) hydrogel is developed. Due to the confined and concentrated environment induced by the interaction between adjacent DNA strands and UCNP&#8208;Au NPs, an ultrastrong photothermal effect is observed. A photothermal efficiency as high as 42.7% is realized in the hydrogel, which is superior to pristine inorganic particles. Upon direct peritumoral injection of the hydrogel and with the treatment of 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, tumors are eradicated and no recurrence is observed. Meanwhile, there are no side effects on normal tissues due to the local treatment. Taking advantage of the high phototherapeutic effect, biocompatibility, and flexible operability in this system, a novel approach for malignant tumor therapy is demonstrated.

      <title>Imaging Domain Reversal in an Ultrathin Van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
      <dc:description>
A magnetic imaging technique based on nitrogen&#8208;vacancy centers in diamond is used to investigate ultrathin flakes of vanadium triiodide (VI3). The results reveal that ultrathin VI3 is a nucleation&#8208;type hard ferromagnet with a coercivity set by the anisotropy strength. The spontaneous magnetization determined for individual flakes is found to be lower than in bulk VI3.








Abstract
The recent isolation of 2D van der Waals magnetic materials has uncovered rich physics that often differs from the magnetic behavior of their bulk counterparts. However, the microscopic details of fundamental processes such as the initial magnetization or domain reversal, which govern the magnetic hysteresis, remain largely unknown in the ultrathin limit. Here a widefield nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) microscope is employed to directly image these processes in few&#8208;layer flakes of the magnetic semiconductor vanadium triiodide (VI3). Complete and abrupt switching of most flakes is observed at fields Hc&#160;&#8776; 0.5&#8211;1&#160;T (at 5 K) independent of thickness. The coercive field decreases as the temperature approaches the Curie temperature (Tc&#160;&#8776; 50&#160;K); however, the switching remains abrupt. The initial magnetization process is then imaged, which reveals thickness&#8208;dependent domain wall depinning fields well below Hc. These results point to ultrathin VI3 being a nucleation&#8208;type hard ferromagnet, where the coercive field is set by the anisotropy&#8208;limited domain wall nucleation field. This work illustrates the power of widefield NV microscopy to investigate magnetization processes in van der Waals ferromagnets, which can be used to elucidate the origin of the hard ferromagnetic properties of other materials and explore field&#8208; and current&#8208;driven domain wall dynamics.

      <title>Exploiting a Single&#8208;Crystal Environment to Minimize the Charge Noise on Qubits in Silicon</title>
      <dc:description>
Despite electron spins in silicon offering a competitive, scalable quantum&#8208;computing platform, two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities to date have fallen short of the 99% threshold required for error&#8208;corrected processors. A notably low level of charge noise of S0&#160;= 0.0088 &#177; 0.0004 &#956;eV2 Hz&#8722;1 is achieved by hosting atom qubits in a crystalline silicon substrate. By separating the atom qubits from surface and interface states, the paper shows how 99.99% two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities can be achieved in silicon.








Abstract
Electron spins in silicon offer a competitive, scalable quantum&#8208;computing platform with excellent single&#8208;qubit properties. However, the two&#8208;qubit gate fidelities achieved so far have fallen short of the 99% threshold required for large&#8208;scale error&#8208;corrected quantum computing architectures. In the past few years, there has been a growing realization that the critical obstacle in meeting this threshold in semiconductor qubits is charge noise arising from the qubit environment. In this work, a notably low level of charge noise of S0&#160;= 0.0088 &#177; 0.0004 &#956;eV2 Hz&#8722;1 is demonstrated using atom qubits in crystalline silicon, achieved by separating the qubits from surfaces and interface states. The charge noise is measured using both a single electron transistor and an exchange&#8208;coupled qubit pair that collectively provide a consistent charge noise spectrum over four frequency decades, with the noise level S0 being an order of magnitude lower than previously reported. Low&#8208;frequency detuning noise, set by the total measurement time, is shown to be the dominant dephasing source of two&#8208;qubit exchange oscillations. With recent advances in fast (&#8776;&#956;s) single&#8208;shot readout, it is shown that by reducing the total measurement time to &#8776;1 s, 99.99% two&#8208;qubit SWAP gate fidelities can be achieved in single&#8208;crystal atom qubits in&#160;silicon.

      <title>Gel Electrocatalysts: An Emerging Material Platform for Electrochemical Energy Conversion</title>
      <dc:description>
Gel electrocatalysts represent an emerging class of materials for sustainable energy technologies. The advantageous features of gel frameworks based on hierarchically porous architecture, high tenability, and functionalization enable them to potentially break the limitations of current materials. An overview of rational synthesis is provided and advanced applications of gel electrocatalysts are highlighted. Challenges and outlooks for gel electrocatalysts are also discussed.








Abstract
Seeking sustainable and cost&#8208;effective energy sources is one of the significant challenges for the sustainable development of modern society. To date, considerable expectations have been held for technologies, such as fuel cells and electrolyzers, where the performance strongly depends on electrochemical conversion processes that can generate and store chemical energy through the breaking or formation of chemical bonds. However, those advanced technologies are severely limited by the efficiency, selectivity, and durability of electrocatalysis. Thanks to their hierarchically porous architecture, compositional and structural tunability, and ease of functionalization, the family of gel materials opens exciting opportunities for advanced energy technologies. Unique advances in gel materials based on controllable compositions and functions enable gel electrocatalysts to potentially break the limitations of current materials, enhancing the device performance of electrochemical energy. Here, recent developments and challenges for nanostructured gel&#8208;based materials for electrocatalysis applications are summarized. Future possibilities and challenges for gel electrocatalysts in terms of synthesis and applications are also discussed.

With the increase in global sustainability challenges, there is a broad spectrum of societal needs where the development of advanced biobased fibers could provide means to address the challenges. Biobased regenerated fibers, produced from dissolved cellulose are widely used today for clothes, upholstery, and linens. With new developments in the area of advanced biobased fibers, it would be possible to compete with high&#8208;performance synthetic fibers such as glass fibers and carbon fibers as well as to provide unique functionalities. One possible development is to fabricate fibers by spinning filaments from nanocellulose, Nature's nanoscale high&#8208;performance building block, which will require detailed insights into nanoscale assembly mechanisms during spinning, as well as knowledge regarding possible functionalization. If successful, this could result in a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers. This work aims to identify the progress made in the field of spinning of nanocellulose filaments, as well as outline necessary steps for efficient fabrication of such nanocellulose&#8208;based filaments with controlled and predictable properties.

&lt;p&gt;Nanocellulose presents an opportunity for the development of a new class of man&#8208;made biobased fibers that can replace high&#8208;performance fossil&#8208;based fibers, as well as provide fibers with new advanced functionalities. Promising material concepts are available, but successful scale&#8208;up will need more profound insights into the mechanisms that control nanoscale assembly during processing.

      <title>Boosting Reaction Homogeneity in High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathode Materials</title>
      <dc:description>
Boosting reaction homogeneity in high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion battery cathode materials is important to stabilize their electrochemical performance. However, conventional nickel&#8208;rich materials suffer from morphological collapse which deteriorates the electrode integrity with heterogeneous reaction behavior. To mitigate these issues, mechanically robust single&#8208;crystalline nickel&#8208;rich particles are suggested. They perfectly maintain their chemo&#8208;mechanical properties during the harsh electrochemical testing condition.








Abstract
Conventional nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials suffer from reaction heterogeneity during electrochemical cycling particularly at high temperature, because of their polycrystalline properties and secondary particle morphology. Despite intensive research on the morphological evolution of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich materials, its practical investigation at the electrode and cell levels is still rarely discussed. Herein, an intrinsic limitation of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich cathode materials in high&#8208;energy full&#8208;cells is discovered under industrial electrode&#8208;fabrication conditions. Owing to their highly unstable chemo&#8208;mechanical properties, even after the first cycle, nickel&#8208;rich materials are degraded in the longitudinal direction of the high&#8208;energy electrode. This inhomogeneous degradation behavior of nickel&#8208;rich materials at the electrode level originates from the overutilization of active materials on the surface side, causing a severe non&#8208;uniform potential distribution during long&#8208;term cycling. In addition, this phenomenon continuously lowers the reversibility of lithium ions. Consequently, considering the degradation of polycrystalline nickel&#8208;rich materials, this study suggests the adoption of a robust single&#8208;crystalline LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 as a feasible alternative, to effectively suppress the localized overutilization of active materials. Such an adoption can stabilize the electrochemical performance of high&#8208;energy lithium&#8208;ion cells, in which superior capacity retention above &#8776;80% after 1000 cycles at 45 &#176;C is demonstrated.

      <title>Conjugated Acetylenic Polymers Grafted Cuprous Oxide as an Efficient Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction for Photoelectrochemical Water Reduction</title>
      <dc:description>
A conjugated acetylenic polymers (CAPs)/cuprous oxide Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction is fabricated by a general nanocopper&#8208;mediated Glaser polycondensation strategy based on in situ conversion of nanocopper into Cu2O in the growth of the CAPs. Eventually, the as&#8208;fabricated poly(2,5&#8208;diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET)/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction substantially facilitates charge separation/transfer and exhibits state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance for photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution.








Abstract
As attractive materials for photoeletrochemical hydrogen evolution reaction (PEC HER), conjugated polymers (e.g., conjugated acetylenic polymers [CAPs]) still show poor PEC HER performance due to the associated serious recombination of photogenerated electrons and holes. Herein, taking advantage of the in situ conversion of nanocopper into Cu2O on copper cellulose paper during catalyzing of the Glaser coupling reaction, a general strategy for the construction of a CAPs/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction for PEC water reduction is demonstrated. The as&#8208;fabricated poly(2,5&#8208;diethynylthieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (pDET)/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction exhibits a carrier separation efficiency of 16.1% at 0.3&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), which is 6.7 and 1.4&#8208;times higher respectively than those for pDET and Cu2O under AM 1.5G irradiation (100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) in the 0.1 m Na2SO4 aqueous solution. Consequently, the photocurrent of the pDET/Cu2O Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction reaches &#8776;520 &#181;A cm&#8722;2 at 0.3&#160;V versus RHE, which is much higher than pDET (&#8776;80 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), Cu2O (&#8776;100 &#181;A cm&#8722;2), and the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cocatalyst&#8208;free organic or organic&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;based heterojunctions/homojunctions photocathodes (1&#8211;370 &#181;A cm&#8722;2). This work advances the design of polymer&#8208;based Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions and high&#8208;performance organic photoelectrodes.

      <title>Independent Tuning of Nano&#8208;Ligand Frequency and Sequences Regulates the Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
A heterogeneous barcoding system including RGD&#8208;bearing Au and RGD&#8208;free Fe nano&#8208;segments is developed to independently present tunable nano&#8208;ligand frequency and sequences without modulating nanoscale and macroscale ligand density. The low&#8208;frequency and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands are demonstrated as novel and independent parameters facilitating focal adhesion&#8208;mediated mechanotransduction of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitate their subsequent differentiation.








Abstract
The native extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit heterogeneous nano&#8208;sequences periodically displaying ligands to regulate complex cell&#8211;material interactions in vivo. Herein, an ECM&#8208;emulating heterogeneous barcoding system, including ligand&#8208;bearing Au and ligand&#8208;free Fe nano&#8208;segments, is developed to independently present tunable frequency and sequences in nano&#8208;segments of cell&#8208;adhesive RGD ligand. Specifically, similar exposed surface areas of total Fe and Au nano&#8208;segments are designed. Fe segments are used for substrate coupling of nanobarcodes and as ligand&#8208;free nano&#8208;segments and Au segments for ligand coating while maintaining both nanoscale (local) and macroscale (total) ligand density constant in all groups. Low nano&#8208;ligand frequency in the same sequences and terminally sequenced nano&#8208;ligands at the same frequency independently facilitate focal adhesion and mechanosensing of stem cells, which are collectively effective both in vitro and in vivo, thereby inducing stem cell differentiation. The Fe/RGD&#8208;Au nanobarcode implants exhibit high stability and no local and systemic toxicity in various tissues and organs in vivo. This work sheds novel insight into designing biomaterials with heterogeneous nano&#8208;ligand sequences at terminal sides and/or low frequency to facilitate cellular adhesion. Tuning the electrodeposition conditions can allow synthesis of unlimited combinations of ligand nano&#8208;sequences and frequencies, magnetic elements, and bioactive ligands to remotely regulate numerous host cells in vivo.

      <title>Controlled Lengthwise Assembly of Helical Peptide Nanofibers to Modulate CD8+ T&#8208;Cell Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
Rationally designed peptides control the assembly of &#945;&#8208;helical peptide nanofibers, allowing the adjustment of nanofiber length within the range of &gt;1 &#181;m&#160;to 100&#160;nm. Shortened nanofibers, while raising equivalent B&#8208;cell responses compared to full&#8208;length fibers, induce heightened CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses in mice.








Abstract
Peptide nanofibers are useful for many biological applications, including immunotherapy, tissue engineering, and drug delivery. The robust lengthwise assembly of these peptides into nanofibers is typically difficult to control, resulting in polydisperse fiber lengths and an incomplete understanding of how nanofiber length affects biological responses. Here, rationally designed capping peptides control the length of helical peptide nanofibers with unique precision. These designed peptides bind the tips of elongated nanofibers to shorten and narrow their length distributions. Demonstrating their use as immunotherapies, capped nanofibers are preferentially cross&#8208;presented by dendritic cells compared to uncapped nanofibers. Due to increased cross&#8208;presentation, these capped nanofibers trigger stronger CD8+ T&#8208;cell responses in mice than uncapped nanofibers. This strategy illustrates a means for controlling the length of supramolecular peptide nanofibers to modulate their immunogenicity in the context of immunotherapies.

These designed peptides bind the tips of elongated nanofibers to shorten and narrow their length distributions. Demonstrating their use as immunotherapies, capped nanofibers are preferentially cross&#8208;presented by dendritic cells compared to uncapped nanofibers. Due to increased cross&#8208;presentation, these capped nanofibers trigger stronger CD8&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; T&#8208;cell responses in mice than uncapped nanofibers. This strategy illustrates a means for controlling the length of supramolecular peptide nanofibers to modulate their immunogenicity in the context of immunotherapies.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Irradiation&#8208;Induced Extremes Create Hierarchical Face&#8208;/Body&#8208;Centered&#8208;Cubic Phases in Nanostructured High Entropy Alloys</title>
      <dc:description>
A nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure is reported to form in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy film via ion&#8208;irradiation&#8208;induced FCC to BCC phase transformation. Both kinetic and thermodynamic conditions for the phase transformation are explored. The results provide a new strategy for tailoring material structures on the nanometer or sub&#8208;nanometer scales.








Abstract
A nanoscale hierarchical dual&#8208;phase structure is reported to form in a nanocrystalline NiFeCoCrCu high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) film via ion irradiation. Under the extreme energy deposition and consequent thermal energy dissipation induced by energetic particles, a fundamentally new phenomenon is revealed, in which the original single&#8208;phase face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) structure partially transforms into alternating nanometer layers of a body&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (BCC) structure. The orientation relationship follows the Nishiyama&#8211;Wasser&#8208;man relationship, that is, (011)BCC || (&#8198;1&#175;1&#175;1)FCC and [100]BCC || [&#8198;11&#175;0]FCC. Simulation results indicate that Cr, as a BCC stabilizing element, exhibits a tendency to segregate to the stacking faults (SFs). Furthermore, the high densities of SFs and twin boundaries in each nanocrystalline grain serve to accelerate the nucleation and growth of the BCC phase during irradiation. By adjusting the irradiation parameters, desired thicknesses of the FCC and BCC phases in the laminates can be achieved. This work demonstrates the controlled formation of an attractive dual&#8208;phase nanolaminate structure under ion irradiation and provides a strategy for designing new derivate structures of HEAs.

      <title>Transparent Hole&#8208;Transporting Frameworks: A Unique Strategy to Design High&#8208;Performance Semitransparent Organic Photovoltaics</title>
      <dc:description>
A&#160;unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer PTAA is employed to partially replace the polymer donors in the active layer. As a result, semitransparent organic photovoltaic devices with power conversion efficiencies &#8776;12% and average visible transmittances &#8776;20% are achieved both on rigid and flexible substrates.








Abstract
Thanks to the nature of molecular orbitals, the absorption spectra of organic semiconductors are not continuous like those in traditional inorganic semiconductors, which offers a unique application of organic photovoltaics (OPVs): semitransparent OPVs. Recently, the exciting progress of materials design has promoted the development of semitransparent OPVs. However, in the perspective of device engineering, almost all reported works reduce the thickness of back/reflected electrode to obtain high average visible transmittance (AVT), which is a trade&#8208;off between power conversion efficiency (PCE) and the transmittance of the whole solar spectrum (visible and infrared), and therefore limit the further development. Herein, a unique strategy of &#8220;transparent hole&#8208;transporting frameworks&#8221; is proposed. A hole&#8208;transporting large&#8208;bandgap polymer (poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine (PTAA)) is employed to partially replace polymer donors in the active layer of PBDB&#8208;T/Y1. PTAA is a p&#8208;type polymer with a large bandgap of 2.9&#160;eV; the partial substitution of PBDB&#8208;T by PTAA reduces the absorption of the active layer only in the visible region, keeping the hole&#8208;transporting pathways as well as the optimized film morphology. As a result, semitransparent OPVs with PCEs of 12% and AVTs of 20% are achieved, both on rigid and flexible substrates. To demonstrate the generality, this strategy is also used in three different active layers.

      <title>A Quantitative Bacteria Monitoring and Killing Platform Based on Electron Transfer from Bacteria to a Semiconductor</title>
      <dc:description>
Enhanced electron transfer (ET) from bacteria to a Au&#8208;modified semiconductor (Au@ZnO) is observed for fast bacteria sensing and killing with excellent extendability, stability, and recyclability. ET produces a saturation current depending linearly on the bacterial number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, and continuous electron loss swiftly kills bacteria. The concept can be incorporated into smart and miniaturized devices that sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.








Abstract
A platform with both bacteria killing and sensing capabilities is crucial for monitoring the entire bacteria&#8208;related process on biomaterials and biomedical devices. Electron transfer (ET) between the bacteria and a Au&#8208;loaded semiconductor (ZnO) is observed to be the primary factor for effective bacteria sensing and fast bacteria killing. The electrons produce a saturation current that varies linearly with the bacteria number, semi&#8208;logarithmically, with R2 of 0.98825, thus providing an excellent tool to count bacteria quantitatively in real&#8208;time. Furthermore, ET leads to continuous electron loss killing of about 80% of Escherichia coli in only 1 h without light. The modularity and extendability of this ET&#8208;based platform are also demonstrated by the excellent results obtained from other semiconductor/substrate systems and the stability is confirmed by recycling tests. The underlying mechanism for the dual functions is not due to conventional attributed Zn2+ leaching or photocatalysis but instead electrical interactions upon direct contact. The results reveal the capability of real&#8208;time detection of bacteria based on ET while providing information about the antibacterial behavior of ZnO&#8208;based materials especially in the early stage. The concept can be readily incorporated into the design of smart and miniaturized devices that can sense and kill bacteria simultaneously.

      <title>Tailoring of Typical Color Centers in Diamond for Photonics</title>
      <dc:description>
The unique electronic structure and excellent spin coherence attract the interest of many researchers to the nitrogen&#8208;vacancy color center. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to solve before fully exerting its characteristic performance. The research progress in these issues is summarized and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends.








Abstract
On the demand of single&#8208;photon entangled light sources and high&#8208;sensitivity probes in the fields of quantum information processing, weak magnetic field detection and biosensing, the nitrogen vacancy (NV) color center is very attractive and has been deeply and intensively studied, due to its convenience of spin initialization, operation, and optical readout combined with long coherence time in the ambient environment. Although the application prospect is promising, there are still some problems to be solved before fully exerting its characteristic performance, including enhancement of emission of NV centers in certain charge state (NV&#8722; or NV0), obtaining indistinguishable photons, and improving of collecting efficiency for the photons. Herein, the research progress in these issues is reviewed and commented on to help researchers grasp the current trends. In addition, the development of emerging color centers, such as germanium vacancy defects, and rare&#8208;earth dopants, with great potential for various applications, are also briefly surveyed.

      <title>A Cyclometalated Iridium (III) Complex as a Microtubule Probe for Correlative Super&#8208;Resolution Fluorescence and Electron Microscopy</title>
      <dc:description>
A versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed, which achieves super&#8208;resolution optical and electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. Correlative light electron microscopy (CLEM) and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy (EF&#8208;TEM) reveals the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.








Abstract
The visualization of microtubules by combining optical and electron microscopy techniques provides valuable information to understand correlated intracellular activities. However, the lack of appropriate probes to bridge both microscopic resolutions restricts the areas and structures that can be comprehended within such highly assembled structures. Here, a versatile cyclometalated iridium (III) complex is designed that achieves synchronous fluorescence&#8211;electron microscopy correlation. The selective insertion of the probe into a microtubule triggers remarkable fluorescence enhancement and promising electron contrast. The long&#8208;life, highly photostable probe allows live&#8208;cell super&#8208;resolution imaging of tubulin localization and motion with a resolution of &#8776;30 nm. Furthermore, correlative light&#8211;electron microscopy and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy reveal the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.

Furthermore, correlative light&#8211;electron microscopy and energy&#8208;filtered transmission electron microscopy reveal the well&#8208;associated optical and electron signal at a high specificity, with an interspace of &#8776;41 &#197; of microtubule monomer in cells.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Sequential Electrodeposition of Bifunctional Catalytically Active Structures in MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO Composite Electrocatalysts for Selective Hydrogen and Oxygen Evolution</title>
      <dc:description>
A new MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid electrocatalyst is designed and synthesized via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy, which exhibits excellent activity and durability for the overall water splitting process. Experimental and theoretical analysis demonstrate the improved hydrogen evolution performance should be mainly attributed to the Ni&#8211;NiO heterostructure, and the generated MoO3&#8211;NiO heterointerface is responsible for enhancing the oxygen evolution activity, synergistically facilitating bifunctional electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Exploring earth&#8208;abundant and highly efficient electrocatalysts is critical for further development of water electrolyzer systems. Integrating bifunctional catalytically active sites into one multi&#8208;component might greatly improve the overall water&#8208;splitting performance. In this work, amorphous NiO nanosheets coupled with ultrafine Ni and MoO3 nanoparticles (MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO), which contains two heterostructures (i.e., Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO), is fabricated via a novel sequential electrodeposition strategy. The as&#8208;synthesized MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO composite exhibits superior electrocatalytic properties, affording low overpotentials of 62 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 347 mV at 100 mA cm&#8722;2 for catalyzing the hydrogen and the oxygen evolution reaction (HER/OER), respectively. Moreover, the MoO3/Ni&#8211;NiO hybrid enables the overall alkaline water&#8208;splitting at a low cell voltage of 1.55 V to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 with outstanding catalytic durability, significantly outperforming the noble&#8208;metal catalysts and many materials previously reported. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively demonstrate the generated Ni&#8211;NiO and MoO3&#8211;NiO heterostructures significantly reduce the energetic barrier and act as catalytically active centers for selective HER and OER, synergistically accelerating the overall water&#8208;splitting process. This work helps to fundamentally understand the heterostructure&#8208;dependent mechanism, providing guidance for the rational design and oriented construction of hybrid nanomaterials for diverse catalytic processes.

      <title>Fabrication of CdS Frame&#8208;in&#8208;Cage Particles for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Generation under Visible&#8208;Light Irradiation</title>
      <dc:description>
CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles are fabricated through a two&#8208;step sulfidation approach. With the advantages of the novel hollow structure, the CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles exhibit enhanced photocatalytic activity toward H2 generation compared with CdS cubes and cages.








Abstract
The design of advanced structures for semiconductor photocatalysts is an effective approach to enhance their performance toward solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion. Hollow and frame&#8208;like structures show advantageous features for photocatalytic reactions with enlarged surface area, shortened charge&#8208;transfer distance, promoted light&#8208;absorption ability, and enhanced mass&#8208;transfer capability. Here, a facile two&#8208;step sulfidation strategy is developed to fabricate unique CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles for photocatalytic hydrogen generation. Cd&#8208;based Prussian blue analog (Cd&#8208;PBA) cubes are first converted to Cd&#8208;PBA cube&#8208;in&#8208;CdS cage particles, which are further transformed to CdS frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage particles. Benefiting from the novel frame&#8208;in&#8208;cage structure, the obtained CdS photocatalyst exhibits high activity under visible&#8208;light irradiation with the hydrogen generation rate of 13.6&#160;mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, which is much enhanced compared with those of the CdS cubes and cages.

      <title>Recent Progress on Topological Structures in Ferroic Thin Films and Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
The timely advance and breakthrough of topological structures (domain walls, flux&#8208;closure domains, vortices, skyrmions, etc.) in ferroic (i.e., ferroelectric, magnetic, and multiferroic) thin films and heterostructures over the past decade is demonstrated. The emergent properties and their multifield manipulations of these topological spin/polar structures hold great promise for the future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectric and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Topological spin/polarization structures in ferroic materials continue to draw great attention as a result of their fascinating physical behaviors and promising applications in the field of high&#8208;density nonvolatile memories as well as future energy&#8208;efficient nanoelectronic and spintronic devices. Such developments have been made, in part, based on recent advances in theoretical calculations, the synthesis of high&#8208;quality thin films, and the characterization of their emergent phenomena and exotic phases. Herein, progress over the last decade in the study of topological structures in ferroic thin films and heterostructures is explored, including the observation of topological structures and control of their structures and emergent physical phenomena through epitaxial strain, layer thickness, electric, magnetic fields, etc. First, the evolution of topological spin structures (e.g., magnetic skyrmions) and associated functionalities (e.g., topological Hall effect) in magnetic thin films and heterostructures is discussed. Then, the exotic polar topologies (e.g., domain walls, closure domains, polar vortices, bubble domains, and polar skyrmions) and their emergent physical properties in ferroelectric oxide films and heterostructures are explored. Finally, a brief overview and prospectus of how the field may evolve in the coming years is provided.

Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have made rapid progress in terms of their development as a sustainable energy source. However, record&#8208;breaking devices have not shown compatibility with large&#8208;scale production via solution processing in particular due to the use of halogenated environment&#8208;threatening solvents. Here, slot&#8208;die fabrication with processing involving hydrocarbon&#8208;based solvents is used to realize highly efficient and environmentally friendly OSCs. Highly compatible slot&#8208;die coating with roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll processing using halogenated (chlorobenzene (CB)) and hydrocarbon solvents (1,2,4&#8208;trimethylbenzene (TMB) and ortho&#8208;xylene (o&#8208;XY)) is used to fabricate photoactive films. Controlled solution and substrate temperatures enable similar aggregation states in the solution and similar kinetics processes during film formation. The optimized blend film nanostructures for different solvents in the highly efficient PM6:Y6 blend is adopted to show a similar morphology, which results in device efficiencies of 15.2%, 15.4%, and 15.6% for CB, TMB, and o&#8208;XY solvents. This approach is successfully extended to other donor&#8211;acceptor combinations to demonstrate the excellent universality of this method. The results combine a method to optimize the aggregation state and film formation kinetics with the fabrication of OSCs with environmentally friendly solvents by slot&#8208;die coating, which is a critical finding for the future development of OSCs in terms of their scalable production and high&#8208;performance.

      <title>T&#8208;Cell&#8208;Mimicking Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
      <dc:description>
T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. The TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors and kill cancer cells while being resistant to the pro&#8208;tumoral factors in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the TCMNPs exhibit a higher therapeutic efficacy than current cancer treatments based on immune checkpoint blockade, and they are effective for the treatment of various tumors.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer and immune checkpoint blockades, have recently shown considerable success in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, transferred T cells often become exhausted because of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint blockades, in contrast, can reinvigorate the exhausted T cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy is modest in 70&#8211;80% of patients. To address some of the challenges faced by the current cancer treatments, here T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. Similar to cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors via T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;originated proteins and kill cancer cells by releasing anticancer molecules and inducing Fas&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs are resistant to immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1)) and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) of cancer cells by scavenging TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and PD&#8208;L1. Indeed, TCMNPs exhibit higher therapeutic efficacy than an immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;tumoral actions of TCMNPs are also demonstrated in the treatment of lung cancer in an antigen&#8208;nonspecific manner. Taken together, TCMNPs have a potential to improve the current cancer immunotherapy.

&lt;p&gt;T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. The TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors and kill cancer cells while being resistant to the pro&#8208;tumoral factors in the tumor microenvironment. Indeed, the TCMNPs exhibit a higher therapeutic efficacy than current cancer treatments based on immune checkpoint blockade, and they are effective for the treatment of various tumors.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer immunotherapies, including adoptive T cell transfer and immune checkpoint blockades, have recently shown considerable success in cancer treatment. Nevertheless, transferred T cells often become exhausted because of the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Immune checkpoint blockades, in contrast, can reinvigorate the exhausted T cells; however, the therapeutic efficacy is modest in 70&#8211;80% of patients. To address some of the challenges faced by the current cancer treatments, here T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles (TCMNPs) are developed for cancer immunotherapy. Similar to cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs can be targeted at tumors via T&#8208;cell&#8208;membrane&#8208;originated proteins and kill cancer cells by releasing anticancer molecules and inducing Fas&#8208;ligand&#8208;mediated apoptosis. Unlike cytotoxic T cells, TCMNPs are resistant to immunosuppressive molecules (e.g., transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946;1 (TGF&#8208;&#946;1)) and programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) of cancer cells by scavenging TGF&#8208;&#946;1 and PD&#8208;L1. Indeed, TCMNPs exhibit higher therapeutic efficacy than an immune checkpoint blockade in melanoma treatment. Furthermore, the anti&#8208;tumoral actions of TCMNPs are also demonstrated in the treatment of lung cancer in an antigen&#8208;nonspecific manner. Taken together, TCMNPs have a potential to improve the current cancer immunotherapy.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Lithium/Sulfide All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries using Sulfide Electrolytes</title>
      <dc:description>
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries are considered to be next&#8208;generation devices for electrochemical energy storages due to their superiority in high safety and energy density. The sulfide electrolytes have become one of the most promising ion conductors due to their high ionic conductivities. At the same time, the favorable interface compatibility of sulfide electrolytes with sulfide&#8208;based cathodes delivers bright prospect of all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASSLBs) are considered as the next generation electrochemical energy storage devices because of their high safety and energy density, simple packaging, and wide operable temperature range. The critical component in ASSLBs is the solid&#8208;state electrolyte. Among all solid&#8208;state electrolytes, the sulfide electrolytes have the highest ionic conductivity and favorable interface compatibility with sulfur&#8208;based cathodes. The ionic conductivity of sulfide electrolytes is comparable with or even higher than that of the commercial organic liquid electrolytes. However, several critical challenges for sulfide electrolytes still remain to be solved, including their narrow electrochemical stability window, the unstable interface between the electrolyte and the electrodes, as well as lithium dendrite formation in the electrolytes. Herein, the emerging sulfide electrolytes and preparation methods are reviewed. In particular, the required properties of the sulfide electrolytes, such as the electrochemical stabilities of the electrolytes and the compatible electrode/electrolyte interfaces are highlighted. The opportunities for sulfide&#8208;based ASSLBs are also discussed.

      <title>Electron Beam Lithography of Magnetic Skyrmions</title>
      <dc:description>
A new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns is demonstrated. By exploiting the thermal reconfigurability of an antiferromagnet, skyrmion lithography can be achieved by writing with a focused electron beam. The work on skyrmion printing will enable the exploration of topological magnetism.








Abstract
The emergence of magnetic skyrmions, topological spin textures, has aroused tremendous interest in studying the rich physics related to their topology. While skyrmions promise high&#8208;density and energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory devices for information technology, the manifestation of their nontrivial topology through single skyrmions and ordered and disordered skyrmion lattices could also give rise to many fascinating physical phenomena, such as chiral magnon and skyrmion glass states. Therefore, generating skyrmions at designated locations on a large scale, while controlling the skyrmion patterns, is the key to advancing topological magnetism. Here, a new, yet general, approach to the &#8220;printing&#8221; of skyrmions with zero&#8208;field stability in arbitrary patterns on a massive scale in exchange&#8208;biased magnetic multilayers is presented. By exploiting the fact that the antiferromagnetic order can be reconfigured by local thermal excitations, a focused electron beam with a graphic pattern generator to &#8220;print&#8221; skyrmions is used, which is referred to as skyrmion lithography. This work provides a route to design arbitrary skyrmion patterns, thereby establishing the foundation for further exploration of topological magnetism.

      <title>Orientation&#8208;Dependent Host&#8211;Dopant Interactions for Manipulating Charge Transport in Conjugated Polymers</title>
      <dc:description>
Surface doping of a conjugated polymer is drastically modulated by molecular orientation. Face&#8208;on orientation presents more reaction sites for dopant/host interactions, leading to effective charge trap filling facilitated by efficient vertical transport down to conductive channel. Hole mobility increases by fivefold to 3 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in the face&#8208;on case, compared to a minimal change in the edge&#8208;on case.








Abstract
Molecular orientation plays a critical role in controlling carrier transport in organic semiconductors (OSCs). However, this aspect has not been explored for surface doping of OSC thin films. The challenge lies in lack of methods to precisely modulate relative molecular orientation between the dopant and the OSC host. Here, the impact of molecular orientation on dopant&#8211;host electronic interactions by large modulation of conjugated polymer orientation via solution coating is reported. Combining synchrotron&#8208;radiation X&#8208;ray measurements with spectroscopic and electrical characterizations, a quantitative correlation between doping&#8208;enhanced charge carrier mobility and the Herman's orientation parameter is presented. This direct correlation can be attributed to enhanced charge&#8208;transfer interactions at host/dopant interface with increasing face&#8208;on orientation of the polymer. These results demonstrate that the surface doping effect can be fundamentally manipulated by controlling the molecular orientation of the OSC layer, enabling optimization of carrier transport.

      <title>A Machine&#8208;Fabricated 3D Honeycomb&#8208;Structured Flame&#8208;Retardant Triboelectric Fabric for Fire Escape and Rescue</title>
      <dc:description>
A multifunctional 3D honeycomb&#8208;structure fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (3D F&#8208;TENG) is fabricated from yarn to fabric by scalable and continuous textile fabrication technology. The 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used as a smart indoor carpet, which has functions of flame retardancy, noise reduction, precise rescue location, and real&#8208;time route guidance under fire conditions.








Abstract
Fire disaster is one of the most common hazards that threaten public safety and social development: how to improve the fire escape and rescue capacity remains a huge challenge. Here, a 3D honeycomb&#8208;structured woven fabric triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) based on a flame&#8208;retardant wrapping yarn is developed. The wrapping yarn is fabricated through a continuous hollow spindle fancy twister technology, which is compatible with traditional textile production processes. The resulting 3D F&#8208;TENG can be used in smart carpets as a self&#8208;powered escape and rescue system that can precisely locate the survivor position and point out the escape route to timely assist victim search and rescuing. As interior decoration, the unique design of the honeycomb weaving structure endows the F&#8208;TENG fabric with an excellent noise&#8208;reduction ability. In addition, combining with its good machine washability, air permeability, flame&#8208;retardency, durability, and repeatability features, the 3D F&#8208;TENG may have great potential applications in fire rescue and wearable sensors as well as smart home decoration.

      <title>Atomically Thin Hexagonal Boron Nitride and Its Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Hexagonal boron nitride is superior for application in van der Waals optoelectronics and electronics. Recent achievements in the synthesis of large&#8208;scale, single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film and its heterostructures via chemical vapor deposition are summarized and the growth kinetics are discussed, emphasizing that the specific orientation of the heterostructure constituents can introduce novel properties.

Abstract
Atomically thin hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) is an emerging star of 2D materials. It is taken as an optimal substrate for other 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices owing to its atomical flatness, absence of dangling bonds, and excellent stability. Specifically, h&#8208;BN is found to be a natural hyperbolic material in the mid&#8208;infrared range, as well as a piezoelectric material. All the unique properties are beneficial for novel applications in optoelectronics and electronics. Currently, most of these applications are merely based on exfoliated h&#8208;BN flakes at their proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept stages. Chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is considered as the most promising approach for producing large&#8208;scale, high&#8208;quality, atomically thin h&#8208;BN films and heterostructures. Herein, CVD synthesis of atomically thin h&#8208;BN is the focus. Also, the growth kinetics are systematically investigated to point out general strategies for controllable and scalable preparation of single&#8208;crystal h&#8208;BN film. Meanwhile, epitaxial growth of 2D materials onto h&#8208;BN and at its edge to construct heterostructures is summarized, emphasizing that the specific orientation of constituent parts in heterostructures can introduce novel properties. Finally, recent applications of atomically thin h&#8208;BN and its heterostructures in optoelectronics and electronics are summarized.

      <title>Proximity&#8208;Coupling&#8208;Induced Significant Enhancement of Coercive Field and Curie Temperature in 2D van der Waals Heterostructures</title>
      <dc:description>
Significant enhancements of Curie temperature (TC) and coercive field (HC) are achieved in ultrathin Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) flakes by using the proximity effect been FGT and FePS3 (FPS). The TC is improved by more than 30 K and the HC is increased by &#8776;100%, which makes 2D FPS/FGT heterostructures promising candidates for applications in magnetic sensors and storage devices.








Abstract
Magnetism in 2D has long been the focus of condensed matter physics due to its important applications in spintronic devices. A particularly promising aspect of 2D magnetism is the ability to fabricate 2D heterostructures with engineered optical, electrical, and quantum properties. Recently, the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetisms in atomic thick materials has provided a new platform for investigations of fundamental magnetic physics. In contrast to 2D CrI3 and Cr2Ge2Te6 insulators, itinerant ferromagnetic Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), which has a larger intrinsic perpendicular anisotropy, higher Curie temperature (TC), and relatively better stability, is a promising candidate for achieving permanent room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism through interface or component engineering. Here, it is shown that the ferromagnetic properties of FGT thin flakes can be modulated through coupling with a FePS3. The magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect results show that the TC of FGT is improved by more than 30 K and that the coercive field is increased by &#8776;100% due to the proximity coupling effect, which changes the spin textures of FGT at the interface. This work reveals that antiferromagnet/ferromagnet coupling is a promising way to engineer the magnetic properties of itinerant 2D ferromagnets, which paves the way for applications in advanced magnetic spintronic and memory devices.

&lt;p&gt;Significant enhancements of Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) and coercive field (&lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;) are achieved in ultrathin Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT) flakes by using the proximity effect been FGT and FePS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (FPS). The &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is improved by more than 30 K and the &lt;i&gt;H&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is increased by &#8776;100%, which makes 2D FPS/FGT heterostructures promising candidates for applications in magnetic sensors and storage devices.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetism in 2D has long been the focus of condensed matter physics due to its important applications in spintronic devices. A particularly promising aspect of 2D magnetism is the ability to fabricate 2D heterostructures with engineered optical, electrical, and quantum properties. Recently, the discovery of intrinsic ferromagnetisms in atomic thick materials has provided a new platform for investigations of fundamental magnetic physics. In contrast to 2D CrI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and Cr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; insulators, itinerant ferromagnetic Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;GeTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (FGT), which has a larger intrinsic perpendicular anisotropy, higher Curie temperature (&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;), and relatively better stability, is a promising candidate for achieving permanent room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism through interface or component engineering. Here, it is shown that the ferromagnetic properties of FGT thin flakes can be modulated through coupling with a FePS&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The magneto&#8208;optical Kerr effect results show that the &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; of FGT is improved by more than 30 K and that the coercive field is increased by &#8776;100% due to the proximity coupling effect, which changes the spin textures of FGT at the interface. This work reveals that antiferromagnet/ferromagnet coupling is a promising way to engineer the magnetic properties of itinerant 2D ferromagnets, which paves the way for applications in advanced magnetic spintronic and memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Enantiomeric MOF Crystals Using Helical Channels as Palettes with Bright White Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
      <dc:description>
Achiral&#8208;aggregation&#8208;caused quenching fluorophores are helically arranged in the chiral channels of enantiomeric metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) for color&#8208;tunable and bright white circularly polarized luminescence (photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), &#8776;33%). The experimental results indicate that the helical arrangement is superior to the ET process in the amplification of glum. Also, the MOF&#8208;based composites are assembled into a bright white circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode (PLQY, &#8776;30%).








Abstract
The host&#8211;guest chemistry of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) has enabled the derivation of numerous new functionalities. However, intrinsically chiral MOFs (CMOFs) with helical channels have not been used to realize crystalline circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) materials. Herein, enantiomeric pairs of MOF crystals are reported, where achiral fluorophores adhere to the inner surface of helical channels via biology&#8208;like H&#8208;bonds and hence inherit the helicity of the host MOFs, eventually amplifying the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) of the host l/d&#8208;CMOF (&#177;1.50 &#215; 10&#8722;3) to a maximum of &#177;0.0115 for the composite l/d&#8208;CMOF&#8835;fluorophores. l/d&#8208;CMOF&#8835;fluorophores in pairs generate bright color&#8208;tunable CPL and almost ideal white CPL (0.33, 0.32) with a record&#8208;high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;30%, which are further assembled into a white circularly polarized light&#8208;emitting diode. The present strategy opens a new avenue for propagating the chirality of MOFs to realize universal chiroptical materials.

      <title>Cellulose&#8208;Based Fully Green Triboelectric Nanogenerators with Output Power Density of 300 W m&#8722;2</title>
      <dc:description>
Fully green triboelectric nanogenerators (FG&#8208;TENGs) are made with cellulose materials and graphite electrodes that have output power density of up to 300 W m&#8722;2. The mechanism behind the high output is the high density of the regenerated cellulose that eliminates the influence of moisture. Such a high output density is on the same order of magnitude as that obtained with fluoropolymers.








Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) have attracted increasing attention because of their excellent energy conversion efficiency, the diverse choice of materials, and their broad applications in energy harvesting devices and self&#8208;powered sensors. New materials have been explored, including green materials, but their performances have not yet reached the level of that for fluoropolymers. Here, a high&#8208;performance, fully green TENG (FG&#8208;TENG) using cellulose&#8208;based tribolayers is reported. It is shown that the FG&#8208;TENG has an output power density of above 300 W m&#8722;2, which is a new record for green&#8208;material&#8208;based TENGs. The high performance of the FG&#8208;TENG is due to the high positive charge density of the regenerated cellulose. The FG&#8208;TENG is stable after more than 30 000 cycles of operations in humidity of 30%&#8211;84%. This work demonstrates that high&#8208;performance TENGs can be made using natural green materials for a broad range of applications.

      <title>Tumor&#8208;Activated Size&#8208;Enlargeable Bioinspired Lipoproteins Access Cancer Cells in Tumor to Elicit Anti&#8208;Tumor Immune Responses</title>
      <dc:description>
The use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agents has potential to potentiate antitumor immune responses and remodel the immunosuppression in tumor, but is tremendously hampered by the poor delivery efficiency. A tumor&#8208;activated size&#8208;enlargeable bioinspired lipoprotein of oxaliplatin prodrug (TA&#8208;OBL) with efficient cancer cell accessibility is designed to boost the ICD&#8208;induced antitumor immunity for synergizing immune&#8208;checkpoint&#8208;blockades&#8208;mediated cancer immunotherapy.








Abstract
The limited lymphocytes infiltration and immunosuppression in tumor are the major challenges of cancer immunotherapy. The use of immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;inducing agents has potential to potentiate antitumor immune responses, but is tremendously hampered by the poor delivery efficiency. Herein, a tumor&#8208;activated size&#8208;enlargeable bioinspired lipoprotein of oxaliplatin (TA&#8208;OBL) is designed to access cancer cells and boost the ICD&#8208;induced antitumor immunity for synergizing immune&#8208;checkpoint blockades (ICBs)&#8208;mediated immunotherapy. TA&#8208;OBL is constructed by integrating a legumain&#8208;sensitive melittin conjugate for improving intratumoral permeation and cancer cell accessibility, a pH&#8208;sensitive phospholipid for triggering size&#8208;enlargement and drug release in intracellular acidic environments, a nitroreductase&#8208;sensitive hydrophobic oxaliplatin prodrug (N&#8208;OXP) for eliciting antitumor immunity into the bioinspired nano&#8208;sized lipoprotein system. TA&#8208;OBL treatment produced robust antitumor immune responses and its combination with ICBs demonstrates strong therapeutic benefits with delayed tumor growth and extended survival rate, making it a promising delivery nanoplatform to elicit antitumor immunity for cancer immunotherapy.

      <dc:description>
A facile graphene quantum dots (GQDs)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly method is developed to achieve centimeter&#8208;sized growth of monolayer organic crystals on a solution interface. The spreading area of organic solvent is greatly enhanced by tuning the pH value of the GQDs solution.

Abstract
Monolayer organic crystals have attracted considerable attention due to their extraordinary optoelectronic properties. Solution self&#8208;assembly on the surface of water is an effective approach to fabricate monolayer organic crystals. However, due to the difficulties in controlling the spreading of organic solution on the water surface and the weak intermolecular interaction between the organic molecules, large&#8208;area growth of monolayer organic crystals remains a great challenge. Here, a graphene quantum dots (GQDs)&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembly method for centimeter&#8208;sized growth of monolayer organic crystals on a GQDs solution surface is reported. The spreading area of the organic solution can be readily controlled by tuning the pH value of the GQDs solution. Meanwhile, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction between the GQDs and the organic molecules can effectively reduce the nucleation energy of the organic molecules and afford a cohesive force to bond the crystals, enabling large&#8208;area growth of monolayer organic crystals. Using 2,7&#8208;didecyl benzothienobenzothiopene (C10&#8208;BTBT) as an examples, centimeter&#8208;sized monolayer C10&#8208;BTBT crystal with uniform molecular packing and crystal orientation is attained. Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the monolayer C10&#8208;BTBT crystals exhibit a high mobility up to 2.6 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, representing the highest mobility value for solution&#8208;assembled monolayer organic crystals. This work provides a feasible route for large&#8208;scale fabrication of monolayer organic crystals toward high&#8208;performance organic devices.

Organic field&#8208;effect transistors based on the monolayer C&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;BTBT crystals exhibit a high mobility up to 2.6 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the highest mobility value for solution&#8208;assembled monolayer organic crystals. This work provides a feasible route for large&#8208;scale fabrication of monolayer organic crystals toward high&#8208;performance organic devices.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Chirality Transfer from Sub&#8208;Nanometer Biochemical Molecules to Sub&#8208;Micrometer Plasmonic Metastructures: Physiochemical Mechanisms, Biosensing, and Bioimaging Opportunities</title>
      <dc:description>
Molecular chirality lies at the heart of bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to their weak chiroptical response. To overcome this inherent limitation, three strategies that can transfer and amplify chirality information from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer plasmonic metastructures are reviewed. Their biosensing and bioimaging applications, present challenges, and future developments are discussed.








Abstract
Determining the structural chirality of biomolecules is of vital importance in bioscience and biomedicine. Conventional methods for characterizing molecular chirality, e.g., circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, require high&#8208;concentration specimens due to the weak electronic CD signals of biomolecules such as amino acids. Artificially designed chiral plasmonic metastructures exhibit strong intrinsic chirality. However, the significant size mismatch between metastructures and biomolecules makes the former unsuitable for chirality&#8208;recognition&#8208;based molecular discrimination. Fortunately, constructing metallic architectures through molecular self&#8208;assembly allows chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer, intrinsically achiral plasmonic metastructures by means of either near&#8208;field interaction or chirality inheritance, resulting in hybrid systems with CD signals orders of magnitude larger than that of pristine biomolecules. This exotic property provides a new means to determine molecular chirality at extremely low concentrations (ideally at the single&#8208;molecule level). Herein, three strategies of chirality transfer from sub&#8208;nanometer biomolecules to sub&#8208;micrometer metallic metastructures are analyzed. The physiochemical mechanisms responsible for chirality transfer are elaborated and new fascinating opportunities for employing plasmonic metastructures in chirality&#8208;based biosensing and bioimaging are outlined.

      <title>Desolvation&#8208;Triggered Versatile Transfer&#8208;Printing of Pure BN Films with Thermal&#8211;Optical Dual Functionality</title>
      <dc:description>
A facile approach to print a pure boron nitride (BN) film with both high thermal conductivity (&#8776;167 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) and optical transparency (&#8776;90%) on various substrates is developed based on desolvation&#8208;induced adhesion switching. This approach allows near&#8208;perfect transfer yield (&#8776;100%) while ensuring good interfacial contact, realizing the full potential of the thermal and optical properties of BN for practical devices.








Abstract
Although hexagonal boron nitride (BN) nanostructures have recently received significant attention due to their unique physical and chemical properties, their applications have been limited by a lack of processability and poor film quality. In this study, a versatile method to transfer&#8208;print high&#8208;quality BN films composed of densely stacked BN nanosheets based on a desolvation&#8208;induced adhesion switching (DIAS) mechanism is developed. It is shown that edge functionalization of BN sheets and rational selection of membrane surface energy combined with systematic control of solvation and desolvation status enable extensive tunability of interfacial interactions at BN&#8211;BN, BN&#8211;membrane, and BN&#8211;substrate boundaries. Therefore, without incorporating any additives in the BN film and applying any surface treatment on target substrates, DIAS achieves a near 100% transfer yield of pure BN films on diverse substrates, including substrates containing significant surface irregularities. The printed BNs demonstrate high optical transparency (&gt;90%) and excellent thermal conductivity (&gt;167 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) for few&#8208;micrometer&#8208;thick films due to their dense and well&#8208;ordered microstructures. In addition to outstanding heat dissipation capability, substantial optical enhancement effects are confirmed for light&#8208;emitting, photoluminescent, and photovoltaic devices, demonstrating their remarkable promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic device platforms.

      <title>A Non&#8208;Invasive Nanoprobe for In Vivo Photoacoustic Imaging of Vulnerable Atherosclerotic Plaque</title>
      <dc:description>
Direct identification of vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque at the molecular level is critical to prevent cardiovascular death. OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes with excellent PA performance well realize the non&#8208;invasive in vivo imaging of vulnerable plaque through the targeted recognition of OPN&#8208;overexpressed foam cells that are the main ingredients of vulnerable plaque, significantly advancing the innovation of cardiovascular disease diagnosis technology.








Abstract
Vulnerable atherosclerotic (AS) plaque is the major cause of cardiovascular death. However, clinical methods cannot directly identify the vulnerable AS plaque at molecule level. Herein, osteopontin antibody (OPN Ab) and NIR fluorescence molecules of ICG co&#8208;assembled Ti3C2 nanosheets are reported as an advanced nanoprobe (OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG) with enhanced photoacoustic (PA) performance for direct and non&#8208;invasive in vivo visual imaging of vulnerable AS plaque. The designed OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes successfully realize obvious NIR fluorescence imaging toward foam cells as well as the vulnerable AS plaque slices. After intravenous injection of OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes into AS model mice, in vivo imaging results show a significantly enhanced PA signal in the aortic arch accumulated with vulnerable plaque, well indicating the remarkable feasibility of OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes to distinguish the vulnerable AS plaque. The proposed OPN Ab/Ti3C2/ICG nanoprobes not only overcome the clinical difficulty to differentiate vulnerable plaque, but also achieve the non&#8208;invasively specific in vivo imaging of vulnerable AS plaque at molecule level, greatly promoting the innovation of cardiovascular diagnosis technology.

      <title>A High&#8208;Energy Aqueous Manganese&#8211;Metal Hydride Hybrid Battery</title>
      <dc:description>
A high&#8208;energy aqueous manganese&#8211;metal hydride battery is developed based on Mn2+/MnO2 two&#8208;electron reactions at the cathode and on hydrogen absorption/desorption reactions at the anode. This new aqueous hybrid battery can achieve a high operating voltage of about 2.2 V and an impressive energy density of about 240 Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable batteries show great application prospects in large&#8208;scale energy storage because of their reliable safety and low cost. However, a key challenge in developing this battery system lies in its low energy density. Herein, a high&#8208;energy manganese&#8211;metal hydride (Mn&#8211;MH) hybrid battery is reported in which a Mn&#8208;based cathode operated by the Mn2+/MnO2 deposition&#8211;dissolution reactions, a hydrogen&#8208;storage alloy anode that absorbs and desorbs hydrogen in an alkaline solution, and a proton&#8208;exchange membrane separator are employed. Given the benefit derived from the high solubility and high specific capacity of the Lewis acidic MnCl2 in the cathode and the low electrode potential of the MH anode, this aqueous Mn&#8211;MH hybrid battery exhibits impressive electrochemical properties with admirable discharge voltage plateaus up to 2.2 V, a competitive energy density of about 240 Wh kg&#8722;1 (based on the total mass of the 5.5 m MnCl2 solution and the hydrogen storage alloy electrode system), good cycling stability over 130 cycles, and a desirable rate capability. This work demonstrates a new strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance and low&#8208;cost aqueous rechargeable batteries.

      <title>Embedded Nickel&#8208;Mesh Transparent Electrodes for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Stable Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics: Toward a Portable Mobile Energy Source</title>
      <dc:description>
Research on flexible mobile energy&#8208;supply devices will promote the development of the Internet of Things. An embedded metal nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode is used as a flexible substrate for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These Ni&#8208;mesh&#8208;based PSCs exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability.








Abstract
The rapid development of Internet of Things mobile terminals has accelerated the market's demand for portable mobile power supplies and flexible wearable devices. Here, an embedded metal&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode (TCE) is prepared on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using a novel selective electrodeposition process combined with inverted film&#8208;processing methods. This embedded nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh flexible TCE shows excellent photoelectric performance (sheet resistance of &#8776;0.2&#8211;0.5 &#937; sq&#8722;1 at high transmittance of &#8776;85&#8211;87%) and mechanical durability. The PET/Ni&#8208;mesh/polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS PH1000) hybrid electrode is used as a transparent electrode for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability. A power conversion efficiency of 17.3% is obtained, which is the highest efficiency for a PSC based on flexible transparent metal electrodes to date. For perovskite crystals that require harsh growth conditions, their mechanical stability and environmental stability on flexible transparent embedded metal substrates are studied and improved. The resulting flexible device retains 76% of the original efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. The results of this work provide a step improvement in flexible PSCs.

     alt="Embedded Nickel&#8208;Mesh Transparent Electrodes for Highly Efficient and Mechanically Stable Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics: Toward a Portable Mobile Energy Source"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Research on flexible mobile energy&#8208;supply devices will promote the development of the Internet of Things. An embedded metal nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode is used as a flexible substrate for perovskite solar cells (PSCs). These Ni&#8208;mesh&#8208;based PSCs exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rapid development of Internet of Things mobile terminals has accelerated the market's demand for portable mobile power supplies and flexible wearable devices. Here, an embedded metal&#8208;mesh transparent conductive electrode (TCE) is prepared on poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) using a novel selective electrodeposition process combined with inverted film&#8208;processing methods. This embedded nickel (Ni)&#8208;mesh flexible TCE shows excellent photoelectric performance (sheet resistance of &#8776;0.2&#8211;0.5 &#937; sq&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at high transmittance of &#8776;85&#8211;87%) and mechanical durability. The PET/Ni&#8208;mesh/polymer poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):poly(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS PH1000) hybrid electrode is used as a transparent electrode for perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which exhibit excellent electric properties and remarkable environmental and mechanical stability. A power conversion efficiency of 17.3% is obtained, which is the highest efficiency for a PSC based on flexible transparent metal electrodes to date. For perovskite crystals that require harsh growth conditions, their mechanical stability and environmental stability on flexible transparent embedded metal substrates are studied and improved. The resulting flexible device retains 76% of the original efficiency after 2000 bending cycles. The results of this work provide a step improvement in flexible PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time&#8208;Gated FRET Nanoprobes for Autofluorescence&#8208;Free Long&#8208;Term In Vivo Imaging of Developing Zebrafish</title>
      <dc:description>
A bright and photostable terbium&#8208;to&#8208;quantum dot F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoprobe for autofluorescence&#8208;free in vivo imaging is described. These nanoprobes enable intracellular four&#8208;color multiplexing with a single excitation wavelength and in situ assembly to fluorescent proteins. They can be imaged in developing zebrafish embryos over seven days with low toxicity and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios.








Abstract
The zebrafish is an important vertebrate model for disease, drug discovery, toxicity, embryogenesis, and neuroscience. In vivo fluorescence microscopy can reveal cellular and subcellular details down to the molecular level with fluorescent proteins (FPs) currently the main tool for zebrafish imaging. However, long maturation times, low brightness, photobleaching, broad emission spectra, and sample autofluorescence are disadvantages that cannot be easily overcome by FPs. Here, a bright and photostable terbium&#8208;to&#8208;quantum dot (QD) F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) nanoprobe with narrow and tunable emission bands for intracellular in vivo imaging is presented. The long photoluminescence (PL) lifetime enables time&#8208;gated (TG) detection without autofluorescence background. Intracellular four&#8208;color multiplexing with a single excitation wavelength and in situ assembly and FRET to mCherry demonstrate the versatility of the TG&#8208;FRET nanoprobes and the possibility of in vivo bioconjugation to FPs and combined nanoprobe&#8208;FP FRET sensing. Upon injection at the one&#8208;cell stage, FRET nanoprobes can be imaged in developing zebrafish embryos over seven days with toxicity similar to injected RNA and strongly improved signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios compared to non&#8208;TG imaging. This work provides a strategy for advancing in vivo fluorescence imaging applications beyond the capabilities of FPs.

      <title>Enabling High&#8208;Performance Tandem Organic Photovoltaic Cells by Balancing the Front and Rear Subcells</title>
      <dc:description>
In tandem organic photovoltaics, most ultraviolet&#8211;visible photons are absorbed by the front sub&#8208;cell, so in the rear sub&#8208;cell, excitons generated on large&#8208;bandgap donors will be reduced significantly. This reduces the conductivity and limits the hole&#8208;transporting property of the rear sub&#8208;cell. An infrared&#8208;absorbing polymer donor is introduced, which provides a second hole&#8208;generation/transporting mechanism to minimize the aforementioned detrimental effects.








Abstract
In tandem organic photovoltaics, the front subcell is based on large&#8208;bandgap materials, whereas the case of the rear subcell is more complicated. The rear subcell is generally composed of a narrow&#8208;bandgap acceptor for infrared absorption but a large&#8208;bandgap donor to realize a high open&#8208;circuit voltage. Unfortunately, most of the ultraviolet&#8211;visible part of the photons are absorbed by the front subcell; as a result, in the rear subcell, the number of excitons generated on large&#8208;bandgap donors will be reduced significantly. This reduces the (photo) conductivity and finally limits the hole&#8208;transporting property of the rear subcell. In this work, a simple and effective way is proposed to resolve this critical issue. To ensure sufficient photogenerated holes in the rear subcell, a small amount of an infrared&#8208;absorbing polymer donor as a third component is introduced, which provides a second hole&#8208;generation and transporting mechanism to minimize the aforementioned detrimental effects. Finally, the short&#8208;circuit current density of the two&#8208;terminal tandem organic photovoltaic is significantly enhanced from 10.3 to 11.7&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 (while retaining the open&#8208;circuit voltage and fill factor) to result in an enhanced power conversion efficiency of 15.1%.

      <title>A Metal&#8211;Organic Framework as a Multifunctional Ionic Sieve Membrane for Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zinc&#8211;Iodide Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
Space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies have originally revealed the negative influence of water and iodine species to zinc anode. Here, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) membrane is adopted to concurrently suppress shuttling of triiodide and regulate electrolyte solvation. Benefited from MOF membrane, aqueous zinc&#8211;iodide battery achieves long&#8208;life (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%).








Abstract
The introduction of the redox couple of triiodide/iodide (I3&#8722;/I&#8722;) into aqueous rechargeable zinc batteries is a promising energy&#8208;storage resource owing to its safety and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Nevertheless, the limited lifespan of zinc&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries is currently far from satisfactory owing to the uncontrolled shuttling of triiodide and unfavorable side&#8208;reactions on the Zn anode. Herein, space&#8208;resolution Raman and micro&#8208;IR spectroscopies reveal that the Zn anode suffers from corrosion induced by both water and iodine species. Then, a metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) is exploited as an ionic sieve membrane to simultaneously resolve these problems for Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. The multifunctional MOF membrane, first, suppresses the shuttling of I3&#8722; and restrains related parasitic side&#8208;reaction on the Zn anode. Furthermore, by regulating the electrolyte solvation structure, the MOF channels construct a unique electrolyte structure (more aggregative ion associations than in saturated electrolyte). With the concurrent improvement on both the iodine cathode and the Zn anode, Zn&#8211;I2 batteries achieve an ultralong lifespan (&gt;6000 cycles), high capacity retention (84.6%), and high reversibility (Coulombic efficiency: 99.65%). This work not only systematically reveals the parasitic influence of free water and iodine species to the Zn anode, but also provides an efficient strategy to develop long&#8208;life aqueous Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

Abstract
Wood&#8208;derived cellulose materials obtained by structure&#8208;retaining delignification are attracting increasing attention due to their excellent mechanical properties and great potential to serve as renewable and CO2 storing cellulose scaffolds for advanced hybrid materials with embedded functionality. Various delignification protocols and a multitude of further processing steps including polymer impregnation and densification are applied resulting in a large range of properties. However, treatment optimization requires a more comprehensive characterization of the developed materials in terms of structure, chemical composition, and mechanical properties for faster progress in the field. Herein, the current protocols for structure&#8208;retaining delignification are reviewed and the emphasis is placed on the mechanical characterization at different hierarchical levels of the cellulose scaffolds by experiments and modeling to reveal the underlying structure&#8211;property relationships.

      <title>Nanocellulose in Emulsions and Heterogeneous Water&#8208;Based Polymer Systems: A Review</title>
      <dc:description>
Nanocelluloses have unique properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsions and latexes. The use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymer systems is reported. Comprehensive tables with past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives are presented, and properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted.








Abstract
Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.

     alt="Nanocellulose in Emulsions and Heterogeneous Water&#8208;Based Polymer Systems: A Review"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocelluloses have unique properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsions and latexes. The use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymer systems is reported. Comprehensive tables with past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives are presented, and properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nanocelluloses (i.e., bacterial nanocellulose, cellulose nanocrystals, and cellulose nanofibrils) are cellulose&#8208;based materials with at least one dimension in the nanoscale. These materials have unique and useful properties and have been shown to assemble at oil&#8211;water interfaces and impart new functionality to emulsion and latex systems. Herein, the use of nanocellulose in both emulsions and heterogeneous water&#8208;based polymers is reviewed, including dispersion, suspension, and emulsion polymerization. Comprehensive tables describe past work employing nanocellulose as stabilizers or additives and the properties that can be tailored through the use of nanocellulose are highlighted. Even at low loadings, nanocellulose offers an unprecedented level of control as a property modifier for a range of emulsion and polymer applications, influencing, for example, emulsion type, stability, and stimuli&#8208;responsive behavior. Nanocellulose can tune polymer particle properties such as size, surface charge, and morphology, or be used to produce capsules and polymer nanocomposites with enhanced mechanical, thermal, and adhesive properties. The role of nanocellulose is discussed, and a perspective for future direction is presented.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Better, Faster, and Less Biased Machine Learning: Electromechanical Switching in Ferroelectric Thin Films</title>
      <dc:description>
A fast, easily implementable approach to improve the interpretability of machine&#8208;learning analyses in materials science is demonstrated. Systematic application of techniques and parameter selection curtails the influence of overinterpretation, reduces user bias, and ultimately improves the quality of such studies. Previously identified exotic phenomena in ferroelectric films can be thus well described by classic ferroelectric and non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena.








Abstract
Machine&#8208;learning techniques are more and more often applied to the analysis of complex behaviors in materials research. Frequently used to identify fundamental behaviors within large and multidimensional datasets, these techniques are strictly based on mathematical models. Thus, without inherent physical or chemical meaning or constraints, they are prone to biased interpretation. The interpretability of machine&#8208;learning results in materials science, specifically materials&#8217; functionalities, can be vastly improved through physical insights and careful data handling. The use of techniques such as dimensional stacking can provide the much needed physical and chemical constraints, while proper understanding of the assumptions imposed by model parameters can help avoid overinterpretation. These concepts are illustrated by application to recently reported ferroelectric switching experiments in PbZr0.2Ti0.8O3 thin films. Through systematic analysis and introduction of physical constraints, it is argued that the behaviors present are not necessarily due to exotic mechanisms previously suggested, but rather well described by classical ferroelectric switching superimposed by non&#8208;ferroelectric phenomena, such as electrochemical deformation, electrostatic interactions, and/or charge injection.

      <title>Facile Morphological Qualification of Transferred Graphene by Phase&#8208;Shifting Interferometry</title>
      <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) is successfully demonstrated as a non&#8208;destructive, fast, accurate, and reproducible imaging tool to measure the morphological quality of transferred graphene, compared to conventional imaging tools. Very fine structures, such as graphene wrinkles, various polymer residues on graphene, and tear&#237;ng/opening of graphene can be successfully visualized using PSI in a one&#8208;shot measurement within few seconds.








Abstract
Post&#8208;growth graphene transfer to a variety of host substrates for circuitry fabrication has been among the most popular subjects since its successful development via chemical vapor deposition in the past decade. Fast and reliable evaluation tools for its morphological characteristics are essential for the development of defect&#8208;free transfer protocols. The implementation of conventional techniques, such as Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy in production quality control at an industrial scale is difficult because they are limited to local areas, are time consuming, and their operation is complex. However, through a one&#8208;shot measurement within a few seconds, phase&#8208;shifting interferometry (PSI) successfully scans &#8776;1 mm2 of transferred graphene with a vertical resolution of &#8776;0.1&#160;nm. This provides crucial morphological information, such as the surface roughness derived from polymer residues, the thickness of the graphene, and its adhesive strength with respect to the target substrates. Graphene samples transferred via four different methods are evaluated using PSI, Raman spectroscopy, and AFM. Although the thickness of the nanomaterials measured by PSI can be highly sensitive to their refractive indices, PSI is successfully demonstrated to be a powerful tool for investigating the morphological characteristics of the transferred graphene for industrial and research purposes.

      <title>Imidazolium&#8208;Functionalized Diacetylene Amphiphiles: Strike a Lighter and Wear Polaroid Glasses to Decipher the Secret Code</title>
      <dc:description>
Information is encrypted into a secret code with imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylene secret inks that respond to heat as well as polarization. The secret code can be deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.








Abstract
The development of smart inks that change color and transparency in response to external stimuli is very important for various fields, from modern art to safety and anticounterfeiting technology. A uniaxially oriented diacetylene thin film on a macroscopic area is obtained by coating, self&#8208;assembling and topochemical photopolymerizing of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes (M&#8208;DA and T&#8208;DA) and 4,6&#8208;decadiyne ink (70 wt%:20 wt%:10 wt%) exhibiting a lyotropic smectic A liquid&#8208;crystalline phase at room temperature. The color and transparency of letters and symbols written with the DA&#8208;based secret inks change reversibly from blue to red as well as from colorless transparent to black opaque depending on the temperature and polarization axis. A secret code written with thermoresponsive and polarization&#8208;dependent secret inks consisting of imidazolium&#8208;functionalized diacetylenes is successfully deciphered by wearing polaroid glasses and holding a flashlight.

      <title>A Cost&#8208;Effective, Aqueous&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Cathode Interlayer Based on Organosilica Nanodots for Highly Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
      <dc:description>
An aqueous solution&#8208;processed cathode interlayer based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) is demonstrated for organic solar cells (OSCs) with power conversion efficiency over 17% and excellent operational stability. The high photostability of OSiNDs&#8208;based OSCs is attributed to the avoidance of photo&#8208;induced shunts and the photocatalyst effect, which are ineluctable shortcomings in inverted OSCs based on ZnO cathode interlayers.








Abstract
The performance and industrial viability of organic photovoltaics are strongly influenced by the functionality and stability of interface layers. Many of the interface materials most commonly used in the lab are limited in their operational stability or their materials cost and are frequently not transferred toward large&#8208;scale production and industrial applications. In this work, an advanced aqueous&#8208;solution&#8208;processed cathode interface layer is demonstrated based on cost&#8208;effective organosilica nanodots (OSiNDs) synthesized via a simple one&#8208;step hydrothermal reaction. Compared to the interface layers optimized for inverted organic solar cells (i&#8208;OSCs), the OSiNDs cathode interlayer shows improved charge carrier extraction and excellent operational stability for various model photoactive systems, achieving a remarkably high power conversion efficiency up to 17.15%. More importantly, the OSiNDs&#8217; interlayer is extremely stable under thermal stress or photoillumination (UV and AM 1.5G) and undergoes no photochemical reaction with the photoactive materials used. As a result, the operational stability of inverted OSCs under continuous 1 sun illumination (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mW cm&#8722;2) is significantly improved by replacing the commonly used ZnO interlayer with OSiND&#8208;based interfaces.

      <title>Mechanics Design in Cellulose&#8208;Enabled High&#8208;Performance Functional Materials</title>
      <dc:description>

Abstract
The abundance of cellulose found in natural resources such as wood, and the wide spectrum of structural diversity of cellulose nanomaterials in the form of micro&#8208;nano&#8208;sized particles and fibers, have sparked a tremendous interest to utilize cellulose's intriguing mechanical properties in designing high&#8208;performance functional materials, where cellulose's structure&#8211;mechanics relationships are pivotal. In this progress report, multiscale mechanics understanding of cellulose, including the key role of hydrogen bonding, the dependence of structural interfaces on the spatial hydrogen bond density, the effect of nanofiber size and orientation on the fracture toughness, are discussed along with recent development on enabling experimental design techniques such as structural alteration, manipulation of anisotropy, interface and topology engineering. Progress in these fronts renders cellulose a prospect of being effectuated in an array of emerging sustainable applications and being fabricated into high&#8208;performance structural materials that are both strong and tough.

      <title>Redistributing Li&#8208;Ion Flux by Parallelly Aligned Holey Nanosheets for Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Metal Anodes</title>
      <dc:description>
Parallelly aligned holey 2D materials on a lithium metal anode are designed to redistribute nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux both in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, as well as to provide fast Li&#8208;ion transport. The protected Li anode achieves ultralong lifetime with low overpotential at a high rate with high capacity.








Abstract
Li metal is the most ideal anode material to assemble rechargeable batteries with high energy density. However, nonuniform Li&#8208;ion flux during repeated Li plating and stripping leads to continuous Li dendrite growth and dead Li formation, which causes safety risks and short lifetime and thus impedes the commercialization of Li metal batteries. Here, parallelly aligned holey nanosheets on a Li metal anode are reported to simultaneously redistribute the Li&#8208;ion flux in the electrolyte and in the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase, which allows uniform Li&#8208;ion distribution as well as fast Li&#8208;ion diffusion for reversible Li plating and stripping. With holey MgO nanosheets as an example, the protected Li anodes achieve Coulombic efficiency of &#8776;99% and ultralong&#8208;term reversible Li plating/stripping over 2500 h at a high current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. A full&#8208;cell battery, using the protected anode, a 4 V Li&#8208;ion cathode, and a commercial carbonate electrolyte, shows capacity retention of 90.9% after 500 cycles.

      <title>Zeolite (In)Stability under Aqueous or Steaming Conditions</title>
      <dc:description>
The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental and computational sides. Situations when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites are covered as well.








Abstract
Zeolites are among the most environmentally friendly materials produced industrially at the Megaton scale. They find numerous commercial applications, particularly in catalysis, adsorption, and separation. Under ambient conditions aluminosilicate zeolites are stable when exposed to water or water vapor. However, at extreme conditions as high temperature, high water vapor pressure or increased acidity/basicity, their crystalline framework can be destroyed. The stability of the zeolite framework under aqueous conditions also depends on the concentration and character of heteroatoms (other than Al) and the topology of the zeolite. The factors critical for zeolite (in)stability in the presence of water under various conditions are reviewed from the experimental as well as computational sides. Nonreactive and reactive interactions of water with zeolites are addressed. The goal of this review is to provide a comparative overview of all&#8208;silica zeolites, aluminosilicates and zeolites with other heteroatoms (Ti, Sn, and Ge) when contacted with water. Due attention is also devoted to the situation when partial zeolite hydrolysis is used beneficially, such as the formation of hierarchical zeolites, synthesis of new zeolites or fine&#8208;tuning catalytic or adsorption characteristics of zeolites.

      <dc:description>
Manipulating the excited&#8208;state evolution in host&#8211;guest complexes is of importance in developing new applications for organic molecular materials. In particular, the efficient production of triplet&#8208;excited states in organic compounds upon light photoexcitation is of interest because of its wide range of applications. In article number 2001592, Joseph T. Hupp, J. Fraser Stoddart, and co&#8208;workers report new organic nanocomposites that combine both porosity and efficient photosensitizing properties for the detoxification of Sulfur Mustard simulant.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2002357, Sang Kyu Kwak, Joon Hak Oh, and co&#8208;workers synthesize perovskite granular wires by a simple yet effective template&#8208;free self&#8208;assembly. Superb photodetection performance with unprecedentedly high photodetectivity is exhibited, which originates from the low dark current due to the band&#8208;edge modulation along the long axis of the granular wires.

      <dc:description>
In article number 2002292, Xinwen Peng, Jun Lu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of mechanically flexible carbon monoliths with much enhanced electrocatalytic activity, which facilitate gas/electrolyte diffusion channels as a novel 3D air electrode. Wood&#8208;derived cellulose nanofibers combined with graphene are used to construct an integrated porous carbon aerogel by directional freeze&#8208;casting and multiple modification. With its superb ORR and OER activity, this material shows remarkable performance as the free&#8208;standing air cathode in energy&#8208;storage systems, including flow metal&#8211;air batteries and flexible solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;air batteries.

&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a&gt;https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.2020022922002292&lt;/a&gt;, Xinwen Peng, Jun Lu, and co&#8208;workers report the design of mechanically flexible carbon monoliths with much enhanced electrocatalytic activity, which facilitate gas/electrolyte diffusion channels as a novel 3D air electrode. Wood&#8208;derived cellulose nanofibers combined with graphene are used to construct an integrated porous carbon aerogel by directional freeze&#8208;casting and multiple modification. With its superb ORR and OER activity, this material shows remarkable performance as the free&#8208;standing air cathode in energy&#8208;storage systems, including flow metal&#8211;air batteries and flexible solid&#8208;state metal&#8211;air batteries.

      <title>Unconventional Charge&#8211;Spin Conversion in Weyl&#8208;Semimetal WTe2</title>
      <dc:description>
An outstanding feature of the topological Weyl semimetal WTe2 is its novel spin topologies in the electronic band structure. An unconventional charge&#8211;spin conversion in WTe2 due to its lower crystal symmetry combined with large Berry curvature and spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states is demonstrated. These findings have great potential for utilizing WTe2 for spintronic circuits and quantum technologies.








Abstract
An outstanding feature of topological quantum materials is their novel spin topology in the electronic band structures with an expected large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. Here, a charge&#8208;current&#8208;induced spin polarization in the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal candidate WTe2 and efficient spin injection and detection in a graphene channel up to room temperature are reported. Contrary to the conventional spin Hall and Rashba&#8211;Edelstein effects, the measurements indicate an unconventional charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in WTe2, which is primarily forbidden by the crystal symmetry of the system. Such a large spin polarization can be possible in WTe2 due to a reduced crystal symmetry combined with its large spin Berry curvature, spin&#8211;orbit interaction with a novel spin&#8208;texture of the Fermi states. A robust and practical method is demonstrated for electrical creation and detection of such a spin polarization using both charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and its inverse phenomenon and utilized it for efficient spin injection and detection in the graphene channel up to room temperature. These findings open opportunities for utilizing topological Weyl materials as nonmagnetic spin sources in all&#8208;electrical van der Waals spintronic circuits and for low&#8208;power and high&#8208;performance nonvolatile spintronic technologies.

      <title>Perovskite Films with Reduced Interfacial Strains via a Molecular&#8208;Level Flexible Interlayer for Photovoltaic Application</title>
      <dc:description>
A protonated amino silane coupling agent as an interlayer is exploited on rigid and flexible substrates, which not only sets up well&#8208;matched growth underlay but also serves as a structural component of the lattice units, leading to less distorted perovskite films, resulting in an obvious advance in device performance, stability, and mechanical tolerance in the corresponding flexible device.








Abstract
Interface strains and lattice distortion are inevitable issues during perovskite crystallization. Silane as a coupling agent is a popular connector to enhance the compatibility between inorganic and organic materials in semiconductor devices. Herein, a protonated amine silane coupling agent (PASCA&#8208;Br) interlayer between TiO2 and perovskite layers is adopted to directionally grasp both of them by forming the structural component of a lattice unit. The pillowy alkyl ammonium bromide terminals at the upper side of the interlayer provide well&#8208;matched growth sites for the perovskite, leading to mitigated interface strain and ensuing lattice distortion; meanwhile, its superior chemical compatibility presents an ideal effect on healing the under&#8208;coordinated Pb atoms and halogen vacancies of bare perovskite crystals. The PASCA&#8208;Br interlayer also serves as a mechanical buffer layer, inducing less cracked perovskite film when bending. The developed molecular&#8208;level flexible interlayer provides a promising interfacial engineering for perovskite solar cells and their flexible application.

      <title>In Situ Designing a Gradient Li+ Capture and Quasi&#8208;Spontaneous Diffusion Anode Protection Layer toward Long&#8208;Life Li&#8722;O2 Batteries</title>
      <dc:description>
A gradient LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon protection layer with synergistic functions of homogenizing Li+ flux, fast Li+ diffusion ability, and low Li+ diffusion barrier is prepared by one&#8208;step in situ reaction to solve the unstable lithium anode challenges in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, as a result, significantly boosting the cycling stability of the Li&#8722;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the only anode material that can enable the Li&#8722;O2 battery to realize its high theoretical energy density (&#8776;3500 Wh kg&#8722;1). However, the inherent uncontrolled dendrite growth and serious corrosion limitations of lithium metal anodes make it experience fast degradation and impede the practical application of Li&#8722;O2 batteries. Herein, a multifunctional complementary LiF/F&#8208;doped carbon gradient protection layer on a lithium metal anode by one&#8208;step in situ reaction of molten Li with poly(tetrafluoroethylene) (PTFE) is developed. The abundant strong polar C&#8208;F bonds in the upper carbon can not only act as Li+ capture site to pre&#8208;uniform Li+ flux but also regulate the electron configuration of LiF to make Li+ quasi&#8208;spontaneously diffuse from carbon to LiF surface, avoiding the strong Li+&#8208;adhesion&#8208;induced Li aggregation. For LiF, it can behave as fast Li+ conductor and homogenize the nucleation sites on lithium, as well as ensure firm connection with lithium. As a result, this well&#8208;designed protection layer endows the Li metal anode with dendrite&#8208;free plating/stripping and anticorrosion behavior both in ether&#8208;based and carbonate ester&#8208;based electrolytes. Even applied protected Li anodes in Li&#8722;O2 batteries, its superiority can still be maintained, making the cell achieve stable cycling performance (180 cycles).

      <title>Superhigh Uniform Magnetic Cr Substitution in a 2D Mo2C Superconductor for a Macroscopic&#8208;Scale Kondo Effect</title>
      <dc:description>
Controlled uniform lattice substitution of 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms is performed through chemical vapor deposition, with Cr concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at%. The controlled substitutional doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample, and the Kondo effect with a high Kondo temperature is achieved at high Cr concentration.








Abstract
Substitutional doping provides an effective strategy to tailor the properties of 2D materials, but it remains an open challenge to achieve tunable uniform doping, especially at high doping level. Here, uniform lattice substitution of a 2D Mo2C superconductor by magnetic Cr atoms with controlled concentration up to &#8776;46.9 at% by chemical vapor deposition and a specifically designed Cu/Cr/Mo trilayer growth substrate is reported. The concentration of Cr atoms can be easily tuned by simply changing the thickness of the Cr layer, and the samples retain the original structure of 2D Mo2C even at a very high Cr concentration. The controlled uniform Cr doping enables the tuning of the competition of the 2D superconductor and the Kondo effect across the whole sample. Transport measurements show that with increasing Cr concentration, the superconductivity of the 2D Cr&#8208;doped Mo2C crystals disappears along with the emergence of the Kondo effect, and the Kondo temperature increases monotonously. Using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, the mechanism of the doping level effect on the interplay and evolution between superconductivity and the Kondo effect is revealed. This work paves a new way for the synthesis of 2D materials with widely tunable doping levels, and provides new understandings on the interplay between superconductivity and magnetism in the 2D limit.

      <title>Spin&#8208;Related Electron Transfer and Orbital Interactions in Oxygen Electrocatalysis</title>
      <dc:description>
A brief discussion on spin&#8208;related charge transfer and orbital interactions in oxygen electrocatalysis is provided. It is expected that a more comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis probably can be established in the near future by including the role of electron spin.








Abstract
Oxygen evolution and reduction reactions play a critical role in determining the efficiency of the water cycling (H2O &#8660; H2 + 12O2), in which the hydrogen serves as the energy carrier. That calls for a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis for efficient catalyst design. Current opinions on oxygen electrocatalysis have been focused on the thermodynamics of the reactant/intermediate adsorption on the catalysts. Because the oxygen molecule is paramagnetic, its production from or its reduction to diamagnetic hydroxide/water involves spin&#8208;related electron transfer. Both electron transfer and orbital interactions between the catalyst and the reactant/intermediate show spin&#8208;dependent character, making the reaction kinetics and thermodynamics sensitive to the spin configurations. Herein, a brief introduction on the spintronic explanation of the catalytic phenomena on oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is given. The local spin configurations and orbital interactions in the benchmark transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for OER and ORR are analyzed as examples. To further understand the spintronic oxygen electrocatalysis and to develop more efficient spintronic catalysts, the challenges are summarized and future opportunities proposed. Spin electrocatalysis may emerge as an important topic in the near future and help integrate a comprehensive understanding of oxygen electrocatalysis.

      <title>Layered Antiferromagnetism Induces Large Negative Magnetoresistance in the van der Waals Semiconductor CrSBr</title>
      <dc:description>
CrSBr is an air&#8208;stable, intrinsically magnetic, van der Waals semiconductor with an electronic bandgap &#8710;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2 eV and photoluminescence peak centered at 1.25 &#177; 0.07 eV. Magnetometry and magnetotransport measurements demonstrate that CrSBr exhibits intraplanar ferromagnetic ordering and interplanar antiferromagnetic ordering below TN&#160;&#8776;&#160;132&#160;&#177; 1 K, producing a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance.








Abstract
The recent discovery of magnetism within the family of exfoliatable van der Waals (vdW) compounds has attracted considerable interest in these materials for both fundamental research and technological applications. However, current vdW magnets are limited by their extreme sensitivity to air, low ordering temperatures, and poor charge transport properties. Here the magnetic and electronic properties of CrSBr are reported, an air&#8208;stable vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor that readily cleaves perpendicular to the stacking axis. Below its N&#233;el temperature, TN&#160;=&#160;132&#160;&#177;&#160;1&#160;K, CrSBr adopts an A&#8208;type antiferromagnetic structure with each individual layer ferromagnetically ordered internally and the layers coupled antiferromagnetically along the stacking direction. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy and photoluminescence (PL) reveal that the electronic gap is &#916;E&#160;=&#160;1.5&#160;&#177;&#160;0.2&#160;eV with a corresponding PL peak centered at 1.25&#160;&#177;&#160;0.07&#160;eV. Using magnetotransport measurements, strong coupling between magnetic order and transport properties in CrSBr is demonstrated, leading to a large negative magnetoresistance response that is unique among vdW materials. These findings establish CrSBr as a promising material platform for increasing the applicability of vdW magnets to the field of spin&#8208;based electronics.

      <title>Evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x Thin Films with Tunable Bandgaps for Short&#8208;Wave Infrared Photodetectors</title>
      <dc:description>
Thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps (from 0.31 eV to 1.87 eV) are prepared for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared photodetectors. The Se0.32Te0.68 film&#8208;based photoconductor fabricated on an optical cavity substrate exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature.








Abstract
Semiconducting absorbers in high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors and imaging sensor arrays are dominated by single&#8208;crystalline germanium and III&#8211;V semiconductors. However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated SexTe1&#8208;x alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of SexTe1&#8208;x films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of SexTe1&#8208;x film&#8208;based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al2O3 to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se0.32Te0.68 film (an optical bandgap of &#8776;0.8 eV)&#8208;based photoconductor exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&#8722;1 and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 1010 cm Hz1/2 W&#8722;1 at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se0.32Te0.68&#8208;based 42 &#215; 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.

The Se&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.68&lt;/sub&gt; film&#8208;based photoconductor fabricated on an optical cavity substrate exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Semiconducting absorbers in high&#8208;performance short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetectors and imaging sensor arrays are dominated by single&#8208;crystalline germanium and III&#8211;V semiconductors. However, these materials require complex growth and device fabrication procedures. Here, thermally evaporated Se&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; alloy thin films with tunable bandgaps for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance SWIR photodetectors are reported. From absorption measurements, it is shown that the bandgaps of Se&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; films can be tuned continuously from 0.31 eV (Te) to 1.87 eV (Se). Owing to their tunable bandgaps, the peak responsivity position and photoresponse edge of Se&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;1&#8208;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; film&#8208;based photoconductors can be tuned in the SWIR regime. By using an optical cavity substrate consisting of Au/Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to enhance its absorption near the bandgap edge, the Se&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.68&lt;/sub&gt; film (an optical bandgap of &#8776;0.8 eV)&#8208;based photoconductor exhibits a cut&#8208;off wavelength at &#8776;1.7 &#181;m and gives a responsivity of 1.5 AW&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and implied detectivity of 6.5 &#215; 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm Hz&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1.55 &#181;m at room temperature. Importantly, the nature of the thermal evaporation process enables the fabrication of Se&lt;sub&gt;0.32&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;0.68&lt;/sub&gt;&#8208;based 42 &#215; 42 focal plane arrays with good pixel uniformity, demonstrating the potential of this unique material system used for infrared imaging sensor systems.&lt;/p&gt;
