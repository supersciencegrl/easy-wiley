         <title>Microscale Combinatorial Libraries for the Discovery of High Entropy Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Polyelemental material systems, specifically high entropy alloys, promise unprecedented properties. Due to almost unlimited combinatorial possibilities, their exploration and exploitation is hard. We address this challenge by co&#8208;sputtering combined with shadow masking to produce a multitude of microscale combinatorial libraries in one deposition process. These thin film composition spreads on the microscale cover unprecedented compositional ranges of high entropy alloy systems and enable high&#8208;throughput characterization of thousands of compositions for electrocatalytic energy conversion reactions using nanoscale scanning electrochemical cell microscopy. The exemplary exploration of the composition space of two high entropy alloy systems provides electrocatalytic activity maps for hydrogen evolution and oxygen evolution as well as oxygen reduction reactions. We identify activity optima in the system Ru&#8208;Rh&#8208;Pd&#8208;Ir&#8208;Pt and discover active noble&#8208;metal lean compositions in the system Co&#8208;Ni&#8208;Mo&#8208;Pd&#8208;Pt. This illustrates that the proposed microlibraries are a holistic discovery platform to master the multidimensionality challenge of polyelemental systems.

         <title>3D Bioelectronics with a Remodellable Matrix for Long&#8208;Term Tissue Integration and Recording</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioelectronic devices have exceptional potential for understanding and treating a host of diseases, but these devices are difficult to place into the body for long&#8208;term usage. Regenerative medicine provides a mechanism to promote integration between tissue and device. Here, it is shown that by using hybrid fabrication techniques, one can seamlessly fuse bioelectronic implants into tissue for long&#8208;term, high&#8208;resolution recordings.








Abstract
Bioelectronics hold the key for understanding and treating disease. However, achieving stable, long&#8208;term interfaces between electronics and the body remains a challenge. Implantation of a bioelectronic device typically initiates a foreign body response, which can limit long&#8208;term recording and stimulation efficacy. Techniques from regenerative medicine have shown a high propensity for promoting integration of implants with surrounding tissue, but these implants lack the capabilities for the sophisticated recording and actuation afforded by electronics. Combining these two fields can achieve the best of both worlds. Here, the construction of a hybrid implant system for creating long&#8208;term interfaces with tissue is shown. Implants are created by combining a microelectrode array with a bioresorbable and remodellable gel. These implants are shown to produce a minimal foreign body response when placed into musculature, allowing one to record long&#8208;term electromyographic signals with high spatial resolution. This device platform drives the possibility for a new generation of implantable electronics for long&#8208;term interfacing.

         <title>Identification of the Origin of Ultralow Dark Currents in Organic Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The dark current in optimized organic donor&#8208;acceptor photodiodes is thermally activated with an energy lower than the effective bandgap and that corresponds to the minimum energy for optical charge generation as determined by photocurrent spectroscopy. This demonstrates that dark current is caused by thermal charge generation at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface and mediated by intra&#8208;gap states near the band edges.








Abstract
Organic bulk heterojunction photodiodes (OPDs) attract attention for sensing and imaging. Their detectivity is typically limited by a substantial reverse bias dark current density (Jd). Recently, using thermal admittance or spectral photocurrent measurements, Jd has been attributed to thermal charge generation mediated by mid&#8208;gap states. Here, the temperature dependence of Jd in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OPDs is reported with Jd down to 10&#8722;9&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V bias. For a variety of donor&#8208;acceptor bulk&#8208;heterojunction blends it is found that the thermal activation energy of Jd is lower than the effective bandgap of the blends, by ca. 0.3 to 0.5&#160;eV, but higher than expected for mid&#8208;gap states. Ultra&#8208;sensitive sub&#8208;bandgap photocurrent spectroscopy reveals that the minimum photon energy for optical charge generation in OPDs correlates with the dark current thermal activation energy. The dark current in OPDs is attributed to thermal charge generation at the donor&#8208;acceptor interface mediated by intra&#8208;gap states near the band edges.

         <title>A Hybrid Acceptor&#8208;Modulation Strategy: Fluorinated Triple&#8208;Acceptor Architecture for Significant Enhancement of Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Unipolar n&#8208;Type Organic Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy is demonstrated based on DPP&#8208;containing fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture (DFB). Therefore, the DFB&#8208;based polymers feature low&#8208;lying FMO levels, shape&#8208;persistent backbones, and high crystallinity. The above features lead to an electron mobility of 5.04&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 in unipolar n&#8208;type transistors, which is the highest electron mobility for DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers reported to date.








Abstract
The development of unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers with electron mobility (&#181;e) over 5&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 remains a massive challenge in organic semiconductors. Diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) has proven to be a successful unit for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type and ambipolar polymers. However, DPP's moderate electron&#8208;accepting capability leads to the shallow frontier molecular orbital (FMO) levels of the resultant polymers and hence limit the &#181;e in unipolar n&#8208;type organic transistors. Herein, this issue has been addressed by using a hybrid acceptor&#8208;modulation strategy based on DPP&#8208;containing &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221;, namely DPP&#8208;difluorobenzothiadiazole&#8208;DPP (DFB). Compared with DFB's non&#8208;fluorinated counterpart, DFB features deeper FMO levels and a shape&#8208;persistent framework. Therefore, a series of DFB&#8208;based polymers demonstrate planar backbones and lowered FMO levels by &#8776;0.10 to 0.25&#160;eV versus that of the control polymer. Intriguingly, all DFB&#8208;polymers exhibit excellent unipolar n&#8208;type transistor performances. Notably, a full&#8208;locked backbone conformation and high crystallinity with crystalline coherence length of 524&#160;&#197; are observed for pDFB&#8208;TF, accounting for its high &#181;e of 5.04&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest &#181;e value for DPP&#8208;based unipolar n&#8208;type polymers reported to date. This work demonstrates that the strategy of &#8220;fluorinated triple&#8208;acceptor architecture&#8221; opens a new path towards high&#8208;performance unipolar n&#8208;type semiconducting polymers.

         <title>Tunable Intervalence Charge Transfer in Ruthenium Prussian Blue Analog Enables Stable and Efficient Biocompatible Artificial Synapses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

A cyanide&#8208;linked ruthenium coordination framework undergoes a 10&#160;000&#8208;fold change in electronic conductivity in response to electrochemical charging or redox reaction with dopamine, enabling battery&#8208;transistor synaptic nonvolatile memory devices that switch via electrical impulses or dopamine reaction. (Electro)chemically tunable mixed valence states dictate the degree of electron delocalization.








Abstract
Emerging concepts for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and brain&#8208;computer interfacing inspire new research avenues aimed at understanding the relationship between oxidation state and conductivity in unexplored materials. This report expands the materials playground for neuromorphic devices to include a mixed valence inorganic 3D coordination framework, a ruthenium Prussian blue analog (RuPBA), for flexible and biocompatible artificial synapses that reversibly switch conductance by more than four orders of magnitude based on electrochemically tunable oxidation state. The electrochemically tunable degree of mixed valency and electronic coupling between N&#8208;coordinated Ru sites controls the carrier concentration and mobility, as supported by density functional theory computations and application of electron transfer theory to in situ spectroscopy of intervalence charge transfer. Retention of programmed states is improved by nearly two orders of magnitude compared to extensively studied organic polymers, thus reducing the frequency, complexity, and energy costs associated with error correction schemes. This report demonstrates dopamine&#8208;mediated plasticity of RuPBA synapses and biocompatibility of RuPBA with neuronal cells, evoking prospective application for brain&#8208;computer interfacing.

         <title>Inverted and Amplified CP&#8208;EL Behavior Promoted by AIE&#8208;Active Chiral Co&#8208;Assembled Helical Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
AIE&#8208;active chiral co&#8208;assembled helical nanofibers as EML of CP&#8208;OLEDs can render excellent CP&#8208;EL performance (|gEL|&#160;= 0.023, &#955;em&#160;= 533&#160;nm) through thermal annealing treatment. Molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that the inverted and amplified CPL behavior can be ascribed to the formation of an ordered helical co&#8208;assembly through the intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interaction between AIE&#8208;active chiral molecules and achiral dye.








Abstract
It is well&#8208;known that high&#8208;performance circularly polarized organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (CP&#8208;OLEDs) remain a formidable challenge to the future application of circularly polarized luminescent (CPL)&#8208;active materials. Herein, the design of a pair of AIE&#8208;active chiral enantiomers (L/D&#8208;HP) is described to construct chiral co&#8208;assemblies with an achiral naphthalimide dye (NTi). The resulting co&#8208;assemblies emit an inverted CPL signal compared with that from the L/D&#8208;HP enantiomers. After thermal annealing at 120&#160;&#176;C, the inverted CPL signal of this kind of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi with a 1:1 molar ratio shows regular and ordered helical nanofibers arranged through intermolecularly ordered layered packing and is accompanied with a further amplified effect (|gem|&#160;= 0.032, &#955;em&#160;= 535&#160;nm). Significantly, non&#8208;doped CP&#8208;OLEDs based on a device emitting layer (EML) of L/D&#8208;HP&#8208;NTi exhibits a low turn&#8208;on voltage (Von) of 4.7&#160;V, a high maximum brightness (Lmax) of 2001&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, and moderate maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 2.3%, as well as excellent circularly polarized electroluminescence (CP&#8208;EL) (|gEL|&#160;= 0.023, &#955;em&#160;= 533&#160;nm).

         <title>Novel Insight into Rechargeable Aluminum Batteries with Promising Selenium Sulfide@Carbon Nanofibers Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Via constructing sufficient valence electronic energy overlapped with aluminum ions and easily accessible structure, an unexplored high&#8208;performance Se2.9S5.1 cathode in rechargeable aluminum batteries is proposed with detailed mechanism characterizations. Through this new strategy, multichannel selenium sulfide@carbon nanofiber (Se2.9S5.1@MCNF) exhibits high capacity (606 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1), high rate&#8208;capacity (211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2 A g&#8722;1), and robust stability.








Abstract
Due to the unique electronic structure of aluminum ions (Al3+) with strong Coulombic interaction and complex bonding situation (simultaneously covalent/ionic bonds), traditional electrodes, mismatching with the bonding orbital of Al3+, usually exhibit slow kinetic process with inferior rechargeable aluminum batteries (RABs) performance. Herein, to break the confinement of the interaction mismatch between Al3+ and the electrode, a previously unexplored Se2.9S5.1&#8208;based cathode with sufficient valence electronic energy overlap with Al3+ and easily accessible structure is potentially developed. Through this new strategy, Se2.9S5.1 encapsulated in multichannel carbon nanofibers with free&#8208;standing structure exhibits a high capacity of 606 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50&#160;mA g&#8722;1, high rate&#8208;capacity&#160;(211 mAh g&#8722;1 at 2.0 A g&#8722;1), robust stability (187 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.5 A g&#8722;1 after 3,000 cycles), and enhanced flexibility. Simultaneously, in/ex&#8208;situ characterizations also reveal the unexplored mechanism of SexSy in RABs.

         <title>Van der Waals Multilayer Heterojunction for Low&#8208;Voltage Organic RGB Area&#8208;Emitting Transistor Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A van der Waals multilayer heterojunction methodology is proposed to realize an organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) array. The OLET array shows uniform RGB area emission and low operating voltage &lt;30&#160;V. Furthermore, a high brightness of under area emission 1060&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a high EQE value of 0.85%, and good operational stability indicate that the multilayer heterojunction is significantly superior to contemporary device structures.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting transistors (OLETs) have garnered considerable attention from academy and industry due to their potential applications in next&#8208;generation display technologies, multifunctional devices, and organic electrically pumped lasers. However, overcoming the trade&#8208;offs among power consumption, external quantum efficiency (EQE), and uniform area emission remains a long&#8208;standing issue for OLETs. Herein, a van der Waals multilayer heterojunction methodology is proposed to enhance the layer&#8208;to&#8208;layer interfacial interaction and contact, resulting in better dipole shielding, carrier transport, exciton recombination, and current density distribution. The prepared multilayer heterojunction OLET (MLH&#8208;OLET) array shows uniform and bright RGB area emission and low operating voltage (&lt;30&#160;V among the lowest applied voltage of reported lateral LETs). Additionally, a high brightness under area emission of 1060&#160;cd m&#8722;2, a high EQE value of 0.85%, and a high loop stability (over 380 cycles, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OLETs) indicate that the proposed multilayer heterojunction is obviously superior to the reported lateral device configuration. The van der Waals multilayer heterojunction developed for the preparation of OLET arrays sufficiently meets the low&#8208;voltage, high&#8208;performance, and low&#8208;cost requirements of future display technologies.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the deep&#8208;sea sponges, a hierarchical electrode of porous nickel microtube arrays decorated with 2D NiFe&#8208;Zn2+&#8208;pore nanosheets is fabricated. It exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and yields a current density of 100 mA cm&#8722;2 over 360 h at the potential of 1.52 V (versus RHE).








Abstract
Hindered gas bubble release and limited electron conducting process represent the major bottlenecks for large&#8208;scale electrochemical water splitting. Both the desorption of bubbles and continuous electron transport are achievable on the surfaces of biomimetic catalytic materials by designing multiscale structural hierarchy.

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by the deep-sea sponges, a hierarchical electrode of porous nickel microtube arrays decorated with 2D NiFe-Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-pore nanosheets is fabricated. It exhibits superior OER performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and yields a current density of 100 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; over 360 h at the potential of 1.52 V (versus RHE).

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hindered gas bubble release and limited electron conducting process represent the major bottlenecks for large-scale electrochemical water splitting. Both the desorption of bubbles and continuous electron transport are achievable on the surfaces of biomimetic catalytic materials by designing multiscale structural hierarchy. Inspired by the tubular structures of the deep-sea&#160;sponges, an exceptionally active and binder-free porous nickel tube arrays (PNTA) decorated with NiFe-Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-pore nanosheets (NiFe-P&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;) are fabricated. The PNTA facilitate removal of bubbles and electron transfer in the oxygen evolution reaction by reproducing trunks of the sponges, and simultaneously, the NiFe-P&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt; increase the number of catalytic active sites by simulating the sponge epidermis. With improved external mass transfer and interior electron transfer, the hierarchical NiFe-P&lt;sub&gt;Zn&lt;/sub&gt;@PNTA electrode exhibits superior oxygen evolution reaction performance with an overpotential of 172&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; (with a Tafel slope of 50&#160;mV&#160;dec&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Tailoring Optical Properties in Transparent Highly Conducting Perovskites by Cationic Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A perfect transparent conductor in the visible range will display 100% transmission in the corresponding wavelength range (black dotted curve). What the engineered advanced conducting perovskite SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3 can do, is indicated by the red dotted curve. Pairing this with the ultrahigh conductivity of this material gives a novel key contender for transparent electronics and plasmonics.








Abstract
SrMoO3 , SrNbO3, and SrVO3 are remarkable highly conducting d1 (V, Nb) or d2 (Mo) perovskite metals with an intrinsically high transparency in the visible. A key scientific question is how the optical properties of these materials can be manipulated to make them suitable for applications as transparent electrodes and in plasmonics. Here, it is shown how 3d/4d cationic substitution in perovskites tailors the relevant materials parameters, i.e., optical transition energy and plasma frequency. With the example of the solid&#8208;state solution SrV1&#8722;xMoxO3, it is shown that the absorption and reflection edges can be shifted to the edges of the visible light spectrum, resulting in a material that has the potential to outperform indium tin oxide (ITO) due to its extremely low sheet resistance. An optimum for x&#160;= 0.5, where a resistivity of 32&#160;&#181;&#937; cm (&#8776;12&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1) is paired with a transmittance above 84% in the whole visible spectrum is found. Quantitative comparison between experiments and electronic structure calculations show that the shift of the plasma frequency is governed by the interplay of d&#8208;band filling and electronic correlations. This study advances the knowledge about the peculiar class of highly conducting perovskites toward sustainable transparent conductors and emergent plasmonics.

         <title>Ultrafast Coherent THz Lattice Dynamics Coupled to Spins in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A step toward the optical generation and control of coherent THz spin and lattice dynamics in 2D antiferromagnets. A coherent hybrid phonon&#8211;magnon mode is triggered in the 2D antiferromagnet FePS3 by pumping below the band gap in the presence of an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Coherent THz optical lattice and hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon modes are triggered by femtosecond laser pulses in the antiferromagnetic van der Waals semiconductor FePS3. The laser&#8208;driven lattice and spin dynamics are investigated in a bulk crystal as well as in a 380&#160;nm&#8208;thick exfoliated flake as a function of the excitation photon energy, sample temperature and applied magnetic field. The pump&#8208;probe magneto&#8208;optical measurements reveal that the amplitude of a coherent phonon mode oscillating at 3.2&#160;THz decreases as the sample is heated up to the N&#233;el temperature. This signal eventually vanishes as the phase transition to the paramagnetic phase occurs, thus revealing its connection to the long&#8208;range magnetic order. In the presence of an external magnetic field, the optically triggered 3.2&#160;THz phonon hybridizes with a magnon mode, which is utilized to excite the hybridized phonon&#8211;magnon mode optically. These findings open a pathway toward the optical control of coherent THz photo&#8211;magnonic dynamics in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, which can be scaled down to the 2D limit.

         <title>As Fiber Meets with AIE: Opening a Wonderland for Smart Flexible Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) and fiber complement each other for making remarkble progress in smart flexible materials. This article provides a comprehensive and fundamental overview of the basic concepts, structure&#8208;function relationship, seminal and recent studies, and the potential directions for future developments regarding AIEgen&#8208;based fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.








Abstract
Aggregation&#8208;induced emission luminogens (AIEgens) have recently been developed at a tremendous pace in the area of organic luminescent materials by virtue of their superior properties. However, the practical applications of AIEgens still face the challenge of transforming AIEgens from molecules into materials. Till now, many AIEgens have been integrated into fiber, endowing the fiber with prominent fluorescence and/or photosensitizing capacities. AIEgens and fiber complement each other for making progress in flexible smart materials, in which the utilization of AIEgens creates new application possibilities for fiber, and the fiber provides an excellent carrier for AIEgens towards realizing the conversion from molecule to materials and an ideal platform to research the aggregate state of AIEgens in mesoscale and macroscale. This review begins with a brief summary of the recent advances related to some typical AIEgens with various functions and the technology for the fabrication of AIEgen&#8208;functionalized fiber. The most representative applications are then highlighted by focusing on energy conversion, personal protective equipment, biomedical, sensor, and fluorescence&#8208;related fields. Finally, the challenges, opportunities, and tendencies in future development are discussed in detail. This review hopes to inspire innovation in AIEgens and fiber from the view of mesoscale and macroscale.

         <title>NIR&#8208;II Responsive Upconversion Nanoprobe with Simultaneously Enhanced Single&#8208;Band Red Luminescence and Phase/Size Control for Bioimaging and Photodynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) (1532 nm) light responsive upconversion nanoparticles with enhanced single&#8208;band red upconversion emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Moreover, NIR&#8208;II light activated red upconversion bioimaging and photodynamic therapy are successfully achieved for the first time.








Abstract
Lanthanide based upconversion (UC) nanoprobes have emerged as promising agents for biological applications. Extending the excitation light to the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II), instead of the traditional 980/808&#8201;nm light, and realizing NIR&#8208;II responsive single&#8208;band red UC emission is highly demanded for bioimaging application, which has not yet been explored. Here, a new type of NIR&#8208;II (1532&#160;nm) light responsive UC nanoparticles (UCNPs) with enhanced single&#8208;band red UC emission and controllable phase and size is designed by introducing Er3+ as sensitizer and utilizing Mn2+ as energy manipulator. Through tuning the content of Mn2+ in NaLnF4:Er/Mn, the crystal phase, size, and emitting color are readily controlled, and the red&#8208;to&#8208;green (R/G) ratio is significantly increased from &#8776;20 to &#8776;300, leading to NIR&#8208;II responsive single band red emission via efficient energy transfer between Er3+ and Mn2+. In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by coating shell to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR&#8208;II light activated red UC bioimaging and photodynamic therapy through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine are successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR&#8208;II light responsive single&#8208;band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.

In addition, the single band red emitting intensity can be further improved by coating shell to avoid the surface quenching effect. More importantly, NIR-II light activated red UC bioimaging and photodynamic therapy through loading photosensitizer of zinc phthalocyanine are successfully achieved for the first time. These findings provide a new strategy of designing NIR-II light responsive single-band red emissive UCNPs for biomedical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imaging Guided Endogenic H2&#8208;Augmented Electrochemo&#8208;Sonodynamic Domino Cotherapy of Tumor in Vivo</title>

Abstract
Precise and on&#8208;demand release of sufficient hydrogen (H2) to the tumor sites remains a key challenge for emerging H2&#8208;oncotherapy, and little is known about the physiological effects of &#8220;abundant&#8221; H2 on complex tumor microenvironments (TME). Here, we report a highly efficient and cost&#8208;effective imaging&#8208;guided/&#8208;assessed H2&#8208;therapy of tumors based on a joint electrochemo&#8208;sonodynamic treatment (H2&#8208;EC/SD cotherapy) with strong &#8220;domino effect&#8221; triggered by endogenous H2 generation at tumor sites to speedily eliminate tumor tissue (&#8804;80 mm3) within 1 day. Adequate H2 was controllably generated in tumor sites through mild electrochemistry in vivo due to acidic TME, by using clinic acupuncture Fe needle as electrodes. Besides starvation damage due to gas blockage destruction for vessels, nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;bubbles of H2 formed in&#8208;situ can elevate its internal temperature and burst vessels to further destroy tumor under ultrasound irradiation. Remarkably, vulnerable homeostasis of TME was disturbed as H2 also participates in physiological activity of tumor cells, leading to the tumor dysfunction. Last but not least, the inflammatory response of body from cancer was reduced after the treatment, beneficial for the body's immune system for post&#8208;treatment recovery. Based on all these merits, the H2&#8208;EC/SD cotherapy provides a potentially safe and viable therapeutic strategy for future clinical applications.

         <title>Impermeable Atomic Layer Deposition for Sputtering Buffer Layer in Efficient Semi&#8208;Transparent and Tandem Solar Cells via Activating Unreactive Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic layer deposition (ALD) growth mode on the commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM is activated from island growth to layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth mode by introducing reaction sites. As a result, the excellent stability, efficient semi&#8208;transparent device, and perovskite/silicon tandem device with reaction sites are available.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) turns out to be particularly attractive technology for the sputtering buffer layer when preparing the semi&#8208;transparent (ST) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and the tandem solar cells. ALD process turns to be island growth when the substrate is unreactive with the ALD reactants, resulting in the pin&#8208;hole layer, which causes an adverse effect on anti&#8208;sputtering. Here, p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PSCs with ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer are conducted. The commonly used electron transportation layer (ETL) PCBM in the p&#8211;i&#8211;n structured PVK solar cell is an unreactive substrate that prevents the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth for the ALD SnOx. PCBM layer is activated by introducing reaction sites to form impermeable ALD layers. By introducing reaction sites/ALD SnOx as sputtering buffer layer, the authors succeed to fabricate ST&#8208;PSCs and perovskite/silicon (double&#8208;side polished) tandem solar cells with power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.25% and 23.31%, respectively. Besides, the unencapsulated device with reaction sites maintains more than 99% of the initial PCE after aging over 5100 h. This work opens a promising avenue to prepare impermeable layer for stable PSCs, ST&#8208;PSCs, tandem solar cells, and the related scale&#8208;up solar cells.

         <title>Shape Morphing Directed by Spatially Encoded, Dually Responsive Liquid Crystalline Elastomer Micro&#8208;Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Shape morphing from nonresponsive elastomer films can be preprogrammed by spatially embedding anisotropic shape&#8208;changing micro&#8208;actuators with certain orientations and height distributions, offering a robust pathway to simultaneously control in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane bending. This work will broaden the material palette for shape&#8208;morphing&#8208;based applications such as soft robotics, smart wearables, displays, and sensors.








Abstract
Liquid crystalline elastomers (LCEs) with intrinsic molecular anisotropy can be programmed to morph shapes under external stimuli. However, it is difficult to program the position and orientation of individual mesogenic units separately and locally, whether in&#8208;plane or out&#8208;of&#8208;plane, since each mesogen is linked to adjacent ones through the covalently bonded polymer chains. Here, dually responsive, spindle&#8208;shaped micro&#8208;actuators are synthesized from LCE composites, which can reorient under a magnetic field and change the shape upon heating. When the discrete micro&#8208;actuators are embedded in a conventional and nonresponsive elastomer with programmed height distribution and in&#8208;plane orientation in local regions, robust and complex shape morphing induced by the cooperative actuations of the locally distributed micro&#8208;actuators, which corroborates with finite element analysis, are shown. The spatial encoding of discrete micro&#8208;actuators in a nonresponsive matrix allows to decouple the actuators and the matrix, broadening the material palette to program local and global responses to stimuli for applications including soft robotics, smart wearables, and sensors.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Programming of Fibroblasts into Neurons via a Scalable Magnetoelastic Generator Array</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile platform that enables self&#8208;powered programming of fibroblasts into neurons via a scalable magnetoelastic generator array is developed. The generated electrical stimulation enhances&#160;the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device can harness the biomechanical activities in human bodies and convert them into electrical signals, thereby potentially providing a general therapeutic approach for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Developing scalable electrical stimulating platforms for cell and tissue engineering applications is limited by external power source dependency, wetting resistance, microscale size requirements, and suitable flexibility. Here, a versatile and scalable platform is developed to enable tunable electrical stimulation for biological applications by harnessing the giant magnetoelastic effect in soft systems, converting gentle air pressure (100&#8211;400&#160;kPa) to yield a current of up to 10.5&#160;mA and a voltage of 9.5&#160;mV. The platform can be easily manufactured and scaled up for integration in multiwell magnetoelastic plates via 3D printing. The authors demonstrate that the electrical stimulation generated by this platform enhances the conversion of fibroblasts into neurons up to 2&#8208;fold (104%) and subsequent neuronal maturation up to 3&#8208;fold (251%). This easily configurable electrical stimulation device has broad applications in high throughput organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems, and paves the way for future development of neural engineering, including cellular therapy via implantable self&#8208;powered electrical stimulation devices.

         <title>Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room&#8208;Temperature Closed&#8208;Loop Recyclability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs) with room&#8208;temperature closed&#8208;loop recyclability are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in strong and stiff thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductility and toughness, as well as reprocessability and rehealability. The mechanical properties of the supra&#8208;CANs are superior to those of strong and tough commodity polycarbonate.








Abstract
Development of closed&#8208;loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in daily life can be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy&#8208;to&#8208;recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely, supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra&#8208;CANs), is reported, which not only displays mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate, but also exhibits excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra&#8208;CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic&#8208;like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogs that do not have noncovalent crosslinks (CANs) show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra&#8208;CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer&#8208;monomer&#8208;polymer circulation.

     alt="Strong and Tough Supramolecular Covalent Adaptable Networks with Room-Temperature Closed-Loop Recyclability"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra-CANs) with room-temperature closed-loop recyclability are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in strong and stiff thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic-like ductility and toughness, as well as reprocessability and rehealability. The mechanical properties of the supra-CANs are superior to those of strong and tough commodity polycarbonate.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Development of closed-loop chemically recyclable plastics (CCRPs) that can be widely used in daily life can be a fundamental solution to the global plastic waste crisis. Hence, it is of great significance to develop easy-to-recycle CCRPs that possess superior or comparable material properties to the commodity plastics. Here, a novel dual crosslinked CCRP, namely, supramolecular covalent adaptable networks (supra-CANs), is reported, which not only displays mechanical properties higher than the strong and tough commodity polycarbonate, but also exhibits excellent solvent resistance as thermosets. The supra-CANs are constructed by introducing reversible noncovalent crosslinks into the dynamic covalent polymer networks, resulting in highly stiff and strong thermosets that also exhibit thermoplastic-like ductile and tough behaviors as well as reprocessability and rehealability. In great contrast, the analogs that do not have noncovalent crosslinks (CANs) show elastomeric properties with significantly decreased mechanical strength. Importantly, the developed supra-CANs and CANs can be converted back into the initial monomers in high yields and purity at room temperature, even with additives, which enables the sustainable polymer-monomer-polymer circulation. This work provides new design principles for high-performance chemically recyclable polymers as sustainable substitutes for the conventional plastics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Targeting Theranostics of Atherosclerosis by Dual&#8208;Responsive Nanoplatform via Photoacoustic Imaging and Three&#8208;In&#8208;One Integrated Lipid Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A theranostic nanoplatform PLCDP@PMH is constructed with atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsiveness, which indicates a plaque&#8208;specific photoacoustic diagnosis and a three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic strategy of integrated lipid management via reducing lipid uptake, enhancing lipid efflux, and actuating lipid removal. PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the diagnosis of early&#8208;stage plaques, the inhibition of atherosclerosis progression, and the reversal of formed lesions.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis, as a life&#8208;threatening cardiovascular disease with chronic inflammation and abnormal lipid enrichment, is often difficult to treat timely due to the lack of obvious symptoms. In this work, a theranostic nanoplatform is constructed for the noninvasive in vivo diagnosis, plaque&#8208;formation inhibition, and the lesion reversal of atherosclerosis. A three&#8208;in&#8208;one therapeutic complex is constructed and packaged along with a polymeric photoacoustic probe into nanoparticles named as PLCDP@PMH, which indicates an atherosclerosis&#8208;targeting accumulation and a reactive oxygen species (ROS)/matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) dual&#8208;responsive degradation. The photoacoustic probe suggests a lesion&#8208;specific imaging on atherosclerotic mice with an accurate and distinct recognition of plaques. At the same time, the three&#8208;in&#8208;one complex performs an integrated lipid management through the inhibition of macrophages M1&#8208;polarization, liver X receptor (LXR)&#8208;mediated up&#8208;regulation of ATP&#8208;binding cassette transporter A1/G1 (ABCA1/G1) and the cyclodextrin&#8208;assisted lipid dissolution, which lead to the reduced lipid uptake, enhanced lipid efflux, and actuated lipid removal. The in vivo evaluations reveal that PLCDP@PMH can suppress the lesion progression and further reverse the formed plaques under a diet without high fat. Hence, PLCDP@PMH provides a candidate for the theranostics of early&#8208;stage atherosclerosis and delivers an impressive potential on the reversal of formed atherosclerotic lesions.

         <title>Simple Visualization of Universal Ferroelastic Domain Walls in Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelastic twin domain walls in lead halide perovskites are visualized using nonpolarized light and simple imaging configurations. These atomically thin domain walls become reflective at high angles and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. Ferroelasticity is found to be universal across lead halide perovskite phases and families, originating from their soft bonding characteristics.








Abstract
Domain features and domain walls in lead halide perovskites (LHPs) have attracted broad interest due to their potential impact on optoelectronic properties of this unique class of solution&#8208;processable semiconductors. Using nonpolarized light and simple imaging configurations, ferroelastic twin domains and their switchings through multiple consecutive phase transitions are directly visualized. This direct optical contrast originates from finite optical reflections at the wall interface between two compositionally identical, orientationally different, optically anisotropic domains inside the material bulk. The findings show these domain walls serve as internal reflectors and steer energy transport inside halide perovskites optically. First&#8208;principles calculations show universal low domain&#8208;wall energies and modest energy barriers of domain switching, confirming their prevalent appearance, stable presence, and facile moving observed in the experiments. The generality of ferroelasticity in halide perovskites stems from their soft bonding characteristics. This work shows the feasibility of using LHP twin domain walls as optical guides of internal photoexcitations, capable of nonvolatile on&#8211;off switching and tunable positioning endowed by their universal ferroelasticity.

         <title>Tuning the C1/C2 Selectivity of Electrochemical CO2 Reduction on Cu&#63743;CeO2 Nanorods by Oxidation State Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tunable CH4/C2H4 selectivity of Cu&#63743;CeO2 nanorods during the electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction by precisely controlling the structure and valence state of the Cu active sites on CeO2 nanorods is reported. The coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters on ceria nanorods lowers the energy barrier for C&#63743;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons.








Abstract
Ceria (CeO2) is one of the most extensively used rare earth oxides. Recently, it has been used as a support material for metal catalysts for electrochemical energy conversion. However, to date, the nature of metal/CeO2 interfaces and their impact on electrochemical processes remains unclear. Here, a Cu&#63743;CeO2 nanorod electrochemical CO2 reduction catalyst is presented. Using operando analysis and computational techniques, it is found that, on the application of a reductive electrochemical potential, Cu undergoes an abrupt change in solubility in the ceria matrix converting from less stable randomly dissolved single atomic Cu2+ ions to (Cu0,Cu1+) nanoclusters. Unlike single atomic Cu, which produces C1 products as the main product during electrochemical CO2 reduction, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) clusters lowers the energy barrier for C&#63743;C coupling and enables the selective production of C2+ hydrocarbons. As a result, the coexistence of (Cu0,Cu1+) in the clusters at the Cu&#8208;ceria interface results in a C2+ partial current density/unit Cu weight 27&#160;times that of a corresponding Cu&#8208;carbon catalyst under the same conditions.

         <dc:description>
Abstract
With advances in flexible electronics, innovative foldable, rollable, and stretchable displays have been developed to maintain their performance under various deformations. These flexible devices can develop more innovative designs than conventional devices due to their light weight, high space efficiency, and practical convenience. However, developing flexible devices requires material innovation because the devices must be flexible and exhibit desirable electrical insulating/semiconducting/metallic properties. Recently, emerging two&#8208;dimensional materials such as graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable research attention because of their outstanding electrical, optical, and mechanical properties, which are ideal for flexible electronics. We review the recent progress and challenges of two&#8208;dimensional material growth and display applications, and discuss perspectives for exploring two&#8208;dimensional materials for display applications.

         <title>Stable Cuprous Hydroxide Nanostructures by Organic Ligand Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stable cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) nanostructures are prepared for the first time by a facile wet chemistry route using acetylene and mercapto derivatives as the capping ligands. Due to the conjugated interfacial linkages with the acetylene moieties, the CuOH nanostructures exhibit a reduced bandgap, new optical/electronic properties, and hence enhance photodynamic activity toward the inhibition of bacterial growth.








Abstract
Copper compounds have been extensively investigated for diverse applications. However, studies of cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) have been scarce due to structural metastability. Herein, a facile, wet&#8208;chemistry procedure is reported for the preparation of stable CuOH nanostructures via deliberate functionalization with select organic ligands, such as acetylene and mercapto derivatives. The resulting nanostructures are found to exhibit a nanoribbon morphology consisting of small nanocrystals embedded within a largely amorphous nanosheet&#8208;like scaffold.

     alt="Stable Cuprous Hydroxide Nanostructures by Organic Ligand Functionalization"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stable cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) nanostructures are prepared for the first time by a facile wet chemistry route using acetylene and mercapto derivatives as the capping ligands. Due to the conjugated interfacial linkages with the acetylene moieties, the CuOH nanostructures exhibit a reduced bandgap, new optical/electronic properties, and hence enhance photodynamic activity toward the inhibition of bacterial growth.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copper compounds have been extensively investigated for diverse applications. However, studies of cuprous hydroxide (CuOH) have been scarce due to structural metastability. Herein, a facile, wet-chemistry procedure is reported for the preparation of stable CuOH nanostructures via deliberate functionalization with select organic ligands, such as acetylene and mercapto derivatives. The resulting nanostructures are found to exhibit a nanoribbon morphology consisting of small nanocrystals embedded within a largely amorphous nanosheet-like scaffold. The acetylene derivatives are found to anchor onto the CuOH forming Cu&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C&#63741; linkages, whereas Cu&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;S&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt; interfacial bonds are formed with the mercapto ligands. Effective electronic coupling occurs at the ligand-core interface in the former, in contrast to mostly non-conjugated interfacial bonds in the latter, as manifested in spectroscopic measurements and confirmed in theoretical studies based on first principles calculations. Notably, the acetylene-capped CuOH nanostructures exhibit markedly enhanced photodynamic activity in the inhibition of bacteria growth, as compared to the mercapto-capped counterparts due to a reduced material bandgap and effective photocatalytic generation of reactive oxygen species. Results from this study demonstrate that deliberate structural engineering with select organic ligands is an effective strategy in the stabilization and functionalization of CuOH nanostructures, a critical first step in exploring their diverse applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Synthetic Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Frameworks for Efficient Proton Conduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bio&#8208;inspired strategy is developed for the synthesis of robust hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs). These HOFs not only exhibit high stability in strong acids or bases but also have a high proton conductivity due to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted H&#8208;bonds. This study demonstrates that the precise structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the understanding of structure&#8208;performance correlations.








Abstract
Hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) are a rising class of promising proton&#8208;conducting materials. However, they always suffer from the inherent contradiction between chemical stability and proton conduction. Herein, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly of lipid bilayer membranes, a series of aminomethylphosphonic acid&#8208;derived single&#8208;component HOFs are successfully developed with different substituents attached to the phosphonate oxygen group. They remain highly stable in strong acid or alkaline water solutions for one month owing to the presence of charge&#8208;assisted hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, in the absence of external proton carriers, the methyl&#8208;substituted phosphonate&#8208;based HOF exhibits a very high proton conductivity of up to 4.2&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;3&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 under 80&#160;&#176;C and 98% relative humidity. This value is not only comparable to that of HOFs consisting of mixed ligands but also is the highest reported in single&#8208;component HOFs. A combination of single&#8208;crystal structure analysis and density functional theory calculations reveals that the high conductivity is attributed to the strengthened H&#8208;bonding interactions between positively charged amines and negatively charged phosphonate groups in the channel of bio&#8208;inspired HOFs. This finding demonstrates that the well&#8208;defined molecular structure of proton conductors is of great importance in the precise understanding of the relationship between structure and property.

         <title>A Highly Efficacious Electrical Biofilm Treatment System for Combating Chronic Wound Bacterial Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly efficacious electrical biofilm treatment system is developed for combating chronic wound bacterial infections. This system applies 75 mA cm&#8722;2 current to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. As a result, this system can rapidly reduce biofilm density by 4&#8211;5 log10 scales using only 65 min treatment.








Abstract
Biofilm infection has a high prevalence in chronic wounds and can delay wound healing. Current treatment using debridement and antibiotic administration imposes a significant burden on patients and healthcare systems. To address their limitations, a highly efficacious electrical antibiofilm treatment system is described in this paper. This system uses high&#8208;intensity current (75&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) to completely debride biofilm above the wound surface and enhance antibiotic delivery into biofilm&#8208;infected wounds simultaneously. Combining these two effects, this system uses short treatments (&#8804;2&#160;h) to reduce bacterial count of methicillin&#8208;resistant S.&#160;aureus (MRSA) biofilm&#8208;infected ex vivo skin wounds from 1010 to 105.2 colony&#8208;forming&#160;units&#160;(CFU) g&#8722;1. Taking advantage of the hydrogel ionic circuit design, this system enhances the in vivo safety of high&#8208;intensity current application compared to conventional devices. The in vivo antibiofilm efficacy of the system is tested using a diabetic mouse&#8208;based wound infection model. MRSA biofilm bacterial count decreases from 109.0 to 104.6 CFU g&#8722;1 at 1 day post&#8208;treatment and to 103.3 CFU g&#8722;1 at 7 days post&#8208;treatment, both of which are below the clinical threshold for infection. Overall, this novel technology provides a quick, safe, yet highly efficacious treatment to chronic wound biofilm infections.

         <title>Flash Recycling of Graphite Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spent graphite anodes can be regenerated by an ultrafast flash recycling method. The valuable battery metals can be easily recovered from the flashed anode products by a 0.1 m HCl post&#8208;treatment. The flash&#8208;recycled anode shows recovered electrochemical performance Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;analysis highlights that flash recycling can significantly reduce total energy and greenhouse gas emissions while turning it into an economically advantageous process.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing production of commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) will result in a staggering accumulation of waste when they reach their end of life. A closed&#8208;loop solution, with effective recycling of spent LIBs, will lessen both the environmental impacts and economic cost of their use. Presently, &lt;5% of spent LIBs are recycled and the regeneration of graphite anodes has, unfortunately, been mostly overlooked despite the considerable cost of battery&#8208;grade graphite. Here, an ultrafast flash recycling method to regenerate the graphite anode is developed and valuable battery metal resources are recovered. Selective Joule heating is applied for only seconds to efficiently decompose the resistive impurities. The generated inorganic salts, including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and manganese, can be easily recollected from the flashed anode waste using diluted acid, specifically 0.1&#160;m HCl. The flash&#8208;recycled anode preserves the graphite structure and is coated with a solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase&#8208;derived carbon shell, contributing to high initial specific capacity, superior rate performance, and cycling stability, when compared to anode materials recycled using a high&#8208;temperature&#8208;calcination method. Life&#8208;cycle&#8208;analysis relative to current graphite production and recycling methods indicate that flash recycling can significantly reduce the total energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission while turning anode recycling into an economically advantageous process.

         <title>Pushing the Limit of Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Deficit via Modifying Buried Interface in CsPbI3 Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a multifunctional optimization strategy based on employing 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salt to modify the buried interface of TiO2 and adjacent perovskite is demonstrated. Benefitting from the suppressed charge recombination loss and decreased energetic mismatch, the target CsPbI3&#8208;based device delivers an efficiency of 20.98% and a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451 V.








Abstract
Although CsPbI3 perovskites have shown tremendous potential in the photovoltaic field owing to their excellent thermal stability, the device performance is seriously restricted by severe photovoltage loss. The buried titanium oxide/perovskite interface plays a critical role in interfacial charge transport and perovskite crystallization, which is closely related to open&#8208;circuit voltage deficit stemming from nonradiative recombination. Herein, target molecules named 3&#8208;sulphonatopropyl acrylate potassium salts are deliberately employed with special functional groups for modifying the buried interface, giving rise to favorable functions in terms of passivating interfacial defects, optimizing energetic alignment, and facilitating perovskite crystallization. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that the buried interface modification inhibits the electron transfer barrier and simultaneously improves perovskite crystal quality, thereby reducing trap&#8208;assisted charge recombination and interfacial energetic loss. Consequently, the omnibearing modification regarding the buried interface endows the devices with an impressive efficiency of 20.98%, achieving a record&#8208;low VOC deficit of 0.451&#160;V. The as&#8208;proposed buried interface modification strategy renders with a universal prescription to push the limit of VOC deficit, showing a promising future in developing high&#8208;performance all&#8208;inorganic perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Improved Molecular Ordering in a Ternary Blend Enables All&#8208;Polymer Solar Cells over 18% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend have been finely modulated by using a ternary strategy. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary blend features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering, which leads to an efficiency of 18.03%, representing the highest efficiency for all&#8208;polymer solar cells thus far.








Abstract
Although all&#8208;polymer solar cells (all&#8208;PSCs) show great commercialization prospects, their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) still fall behind their small molecule acceptor&#8208;based counterparts. In all&#8208;polymer blends, the optimized morphology and high molecular ordering are difficult to achieve since there is troublesome competition between the crystallinity of the polymer donor and acceptor during the film&#8208;formation process. Therefore, it is&#160;challenging to improve the performance of all&#8208;PSCs. Herein, a ternary strategy is adopted to modulate the morphology and the molecular crystallinity of an all&#8208;polymer blend, in which PM6:PY&#8208;82 is selected as the host blend and PY&#8208;DT is employed as a guest component. Benefiting from the favorable miscibility of the two acceptors and the higher regularity of PY&#8208;DT, the ternary matrix features a well&#8208;defined fibrillar morphology and improved molecular ordering. Consequently, the champion PM6:PY&#8208;82:PY&#8208;DT device produces a record&#8208;high PCE of 18.03%, with simultaneously improved open&#8208;circuit voltage, short&#8208;circuit current and fill factor in comparison with the binary devices. High&#8208;performance large&#8208;area (1 cm2) and thick&#8208;film (300&#160;nm) all&#8208;PSCs are also successfully fabricated with PCEs of 16.35% and 15.70%, respectively.Moreover, 16.5&#160;cm2 organic solar module affords an encouraging PCE of 13.84% when using the non&#8208;halogenated solvent , showing the great potential of &#8220;Lab&#8208;to&#8208;Fab&#8221; transition of all&#8208;PSCs.

         <title>Entering a New Dimension in Powder Processing for Advanced Ceramics Shaping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Entering a new dimension in powder processing of advanced ceramics with not yet reached geometrical resolution is realized by two&#8208;photon polymerization of colloidal suspensions. Light scattering is reduced by using extremely well&#8208;dispersed zirconia nanoparticles providing transparent suspensions with up to 80 wt% solid loading. Mechanical properties of manufactured structures are outstanding.








Abstract
Filigree structures can be manufactured via two&#8208;photon polymerization (2PP) operating in the regime of nonlinear light absorption. For the first time, it is possible to apply this technique to the powder processing of ceramic structures with a feature size in the range of the critical defect sizes responsible for brittle fracture and, thus, affecting fracture toughness of high&#8208;performance ceramics. In this way, tailoring of advanced properties can be achieved already in the shaping process. Traditionally, 2PP relies on transparent polymerizable resins, which are diametrically opposed to the usually completely opaque ceramic resins and slurries. Here a transparent and photocurable suspension of nanoparticles (resin) with very high mass fractions of yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia particles (YSZ) is presented. Due to the extremely well&#8208;dispersed nanoparticles, scattering of light can be effectively suppressed at the process&#8208;relevant wavelength of 800&#160;nm. Sintered ceramic structures with a resolution of down to 500&#160;nm are obtained. Even at reduced densities of 1&#8211;4&#160;g cm&#8722;3, the resulting compressive strength with 4.5&#160;GPa is equivalent or even exceeding bulk monolithic yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia. A ceramic metamaterial is born, where the mechanical properties of yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia are altered by changing geometrical parameters, and gives access to a new class of ceramic materials.

         <title>Entropy Stabilization Strategy for Enhancing the Local Structural Adaptability of Li&#8208;Rich Cathode Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability: no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. This leads to high stability of the capacity and voltage, greatly enhancing energy retention.








Abstract
Layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with high reversible energy densities are becoming prevalent. However, owing to the activation of low&#8208;potential redox couples and the progressively irreversible structural transformation caused by the local adjustment of transition&#8208;metal ions in the intra/interlayer driven by anionic redox, continuous capacity degradation, and voltage decay emerge, thus greatly reducing the energy density and increasing the difficulty of battery system management. Herein, layered Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with higher intralayer configuration entropy have more local structural diversity and higher distortion energy, resulting in superior local structural adaptability with no drastic redox couple evolution, major local structural adjustment, or obvious layered&#8208;to&#8208;spinel phase transition. Consequently, the energy retention of the entropy&#8208;stabilization&#8208;strategy&#8208;enhanced Li&#8208;rich cathode materials is almost twice that of a typical Li&#8208;rich cathode material (Li1.20Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2, T&#8208;LRM) after 3 months of cyclic testing. Moreover, when cycled at 1&#160;C, the voltage degradation per cycle is less than 0.02%, that is, it results in a voltage loss of only 0.8&#160;mV per cycle, which is excellent performance. This study paves the way for the development of Li&#8208;rich cathode materials with stabilized intralayer atomic arrangements and high local structural adaptability.

         <title>A Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Spintronic System with Proximity&#8208;Enhanced Ferromagnetic Topological Surface State of FeSi above Room Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature ferromagnetism and strong spin&#8211;orbit coupling are realized at a novel topological surface state of the nonmagnetic insulator FeSi by exploiting the proximity effect from a wide&#8208;bandgap insulator. A consequent spintronic functionality, that is, current&#8208;induced magnetization switching at room temperature, shows great potential for the application of proximity&#8208;controlled light&#8208;element topological materials as noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free devices.








Abstract
Strongly spin&#8211;orbit coupled states at metal interfaces, topological insulators, and 2D materials enable efficient electric control of spin states, offering great potential for spintronics. However, there are still materials challenges to overcome, including the integration into advanced silicon electronics and the scarce resources of constituent heavy elements of those materials. Through magneto&#8208;transport measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations, here robust spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC)&#8208;induced properties of a ferromagnetic topological surface state in FeSi and their controllability via hybridization with adjacent materials are demonstrated. In comparison to the case of its naturally oxidized surface, the ferromagnetic transition temperature is greatly increased beyond room temperature and the effective SOC strength is almost doubled at the surface in proximity to a wide&#8208;bandgap fluoride insulator. Those enhanced magnetic properties enable room&#8208;temperature magnetization switching, being applicable to spin&#8211;orbit torque based spintronic devices. Realization of strong SOC in the noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free silicon&#8208;based compound will accelerate spintronic applications.

         <title>Sulfonium&#8208;Cations&#8208;Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h.

     alt="Sulfonium-Cations-Assisted Intermediate Engineering for Quasi-2D Perovskite Solar Cells"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The effects of sulfonium cation on the evolution of intermediates in quasi-2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites are investigated. It is found that the undesired intermediate can be suppressed with a favorable intermediate promoted after treatment, leading to improved film quality and enhanced device performance with superior photovoltaic efficiency and stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D&#160;Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskites with superior stability are admirable candidates for perovskite solar cells (PSCs) toward commercialization. However, the device performance remains unsatisfactory due to the disordered crystallization of perovskites. In this work, the effects of sulfonium cations on the evolution of intermediates and photovoltaic properties of 2D RP perovskites are investigated. The introduction of sulfonium cations leads to preferred intermediate transformation and improved film quality of perovskites. The resulting devices deliver a champion efficiency of 19.08% at room temperature and 20.52% at 180&#160;K, due to reduced recombination and enhanced charge transport. More importantly, the unencapsulated device maintains 84% of the initial efficiency under maximum power point (MPP) tracking at 40&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h. This work helps to gain a comprehensive understanding of the crystallization process of quasi-2D perovskites and provides a simple strategy to modulate the intermediates of perovskites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Perspectives of 2D MXene Tribology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings.&#160;The most promising results in MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations are provided.








Abstract
The large and rapidly growing family of 2D early transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides (MXenes) raises significant interest in the materials science and chemistry of materials communities. Discovered a little more than a decade ago, MXenes have already demonstrated outstanding potential in various applications ranging from energy storage to biology and medicine. The past two years have witnessed increased experimental and theoretical efforts toward studying MXenes&#8217; mechanical and tribological properties when used as lubricant additives, reinforcement phases in composites, or solid lubricant coatings. Although research on the understanding of the friction and wear performance of MXenes under dry and lubricated conditions is still in its early stages, it has experienced rapid growth due to the excellent mechanical properties and chemical reactivities offered by MXenes that make them adaptable to being combined with other materials, thus boosting their tribological performance. In this perspective, the most promising results in the area of MXene tribology are summarized, future important problems to be pursued further are outlined, and methodological recommendations&#160;that could be useful for experts as well as newcomers to MXenes research, in particular, to the emerging area of MXene tribology, are provided.

         <title>Merging Passivation in Synthesis Enabling the Lowest Open&#8208;Circuit Voltage Loss for PbS Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive lead sulfide colloidal quantum dot (PbS CQD) inks. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading a high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc)) of 0.71&#160;V and efficiency of 13.3%, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells.








Abstract
The high open&#8208;circuit voltage (Voc) loss arising from insufficient surface passivation is the main factor that limits the efficiency of current lead sulfide colloidal quantum dots (PbS CQDs) solar cell. Here, synergistic passivation is performed in the direct synthesis of conductive PbS CQD inks by introducing multifunctional ligands to well coordinate the complicated CQDs surface with the thermodynamically optimal configuration. The improved passivation effect is intactly delivered to the final photovoltaic device, leading to an order lower surface trap density and beneficial doping behavior compared to the control sample. The obtained CQD inks show the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of 24% for all photovoltaic PbS CQD inks, which is more than twice the reported average PLQY value of &#8776;10%. As a result, a high Voc of 0.71&#160;V and power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 13.3% is achieved, which results in the lowest Voc loss (0.35&#160;eV) for the reported PbS CQD solar cells with PCE &gt;10%, comparable to that of perovskite solar cells. This work provides valuable insights into the future CQDs passivation strategies and also demonstrates the great potential for the direct&#8208;synthesis protocol of PbS CQDs.

         <title>Perovskite Solar Cell&#8208;Gated Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Flexible Photodetectors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Fast Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance flexible photodetector is realized by gating an organic electrochemical transistor with a perovskite solar cell, outperforming previously reported flexible photodetectors, which can be attributed to the high transconductance of the transistor. The device can monitor photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even remotely. This novel device design demonstrates great potential in emerging wearable optoelectronics.








Abstract
Photodetectors (PDs) are the building block of various imaging and sensing applications. However, commercially available PDs based on crystalline inorganic semiconductors cannot meet the requirements of emerging wearable/implantable applications due to their rigidity and fragility, which creates the need for flexible devices. Here, a high&#8208;performance flexible PD is presented by gating an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) with a perovskite solar cell. Due to the ultrahigh transconductance of the OECT, the device demonstrates a high gain of &#8776;106, a fast response time of 67&#160;&#181;s and an ultrahigh detectivity of 6.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones to light signals under a low working voltage (&#8804;0.6&#160;V). Thanks to the ultrahigh sensitivity and fast response, the device can track photoplethysmogram signals and peripheral oxygen saturation under ambient light and even provide contactless remote sensing, offering a low&#8208;power and convenient way for continuous vital signs monitoring. This work offers a novel strategy for realizing high&#8208;performance flexible PDs that are promising for low&#8208;power, user&#8208;friendly and wearable optoelectronics.

         <title>Electrical Manipulation of Topological Phases in Quantum Anomalous Hall Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Quantum anomalous Hall phases arising from the inverted band topology in magnetically&#8208;doped topological insulators have emerged as an important subject of research for quantization at zero magnetic fields. Though necessary for practical implementation, sophisticated electrical control of molecular beam epitaxy grown quantum anomalous Hall matter have been stymied by growth and fabrication challenges. Here we demonstrate a novel procedure, employing a combination of thin film deposition and two&#8208;dimensional material stacking techniques, to create dualgated devices of the molecular beam epitaxy grown quantum anomalous Hall insulator, Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3. In these devices, we demonstrate orthogonal control over the field&#8208;induced charge density and electric displacement field. We present a thorough examination of material responses to tuning along each control axis, realizing magnetic property control along the former and a novel capability to manipulate the surface exchange gap along the latter. Through electrically addressing the exchange gap, the capabilities to either strengthen the quantum anomalous Hall state or suppress it entirely and drive a topological phase transition to a trivial state are demonstrated. The experimental result is explained using first principle theoretical calculations, and establishes a practical route for in&#8208;situ control of quantum anomalous Hall states and topology.

         <title>A Flexible, High&#8208;Voltage (&gt;100&#160;V) Generating Device Based on Zebra&#8208;like Asymmetrical Photovoltaic Cascade</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The mutual conversion between light and electricity lies at the heart of optoelectronic and photonic applications. Maximization of the photoelectric conversion is a long&#8208;term goal which can be pursued via the fabrication of devices with ad&#8208;hoc architectures. In this framework it is of utter importance to harvest and transform light irradiation into high electric potential in specific area for driving functional dielectrics that respond to pure electric field. Here we have devised a nano&#8208;fabrication technology featuring double self&#8208;alignment and applied it to construct zebra&#8208;like asymmetric heterojunctions arrays. Such nanostructured composite, which cover a surface area of 5 &#215; 4 mm2 and contain 500 periodic repeating units, is capable to photo generate voltages as high as 140&#160;V on a flexible substrate. This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices, by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta&#8208;material.

This approach represents a leap over the traditional functionalization process based on simply embedding materials into devices, by demonstrating the disruptive potential of integrating oriented nanoscale device components into meta-material.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Many&#8208;body Correlations and Exciton Complexes in CsPbBr3 Quantum Dots</title>

Abstract
All&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite (CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br, I) quantum dots (QDs) have emerged as a competitive platform for classical light&#8208;emitting devices (in the weak light&#8208;matter interaction regime, e.g., LEDs and laser), as well as for devices exploiting strong light&#8208;matter interaction at room temperature. Many&#8208;body interactions and quantum correlations among photogenerated exciton complexes play an essential role, e.g., by determining the laser threshold, the overall brightness of LEDs, and the single&#8208;photon purity in quantum light sources. Here, by combining cryogenic single&#8208;QD photoluminescence spectroscopy with configuration&#8208;interaction (CI) calculations, we address the size&#8208;dependent trion and biexciton binding energies. Trion binding energies increase from 7 meV to 17 meV for QD sizes decreasing from 30&#160;nm to 9&#160;nm, while the biexciton binding energies increase from 15 meV to 30 meV, respectively. CI calculations quantitatively corroborate the experimental results and suggest that the effective dielectric constant for biexcitons slightly deviates from the one of the single excitons, potentially as a result of coupling to the lattice in the multiexciton regime. Our findings provide a deep insight into the multiexciton properties in all&#8208;inorganic lead&#8208;halide perovskite QDs, essential for classical and quantum optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Fully Optical in Operando Investigation of Ambient Condition Electrical Switching in MoS2 Nanodevices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
MoS2 nanoswitches have shown superb ultra&#8208;low switching energies without excessive leakage currents. However, the debate about the origin and volatility of electrical switching is unresolved due to the lack of adequate nano&#8208;imaging of devices in operando. Here, we combine three optical techniques to perform the first non&#8208;invasive in situ characterization of nanosized MoS2 devices. Our study reveals volatile threshold resistive switching due to the intercalation of metallic atoms from electrodes directly between Mo and S atoms, without the assistance of sulfur vacancies. We observe a &#8220;semi&#8208;memristive&#8221; effect driven by an organic adlayer adjacent to MoS2, which suggests that non&#8208;volatility can be achieved by careful interface engineering. Our findings provide a crucial understanding of nano&#8208;process in vertically biased MoS2 nanosheets, which opens new routes to conscious engineering and optimization of 2D electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency and Mechanically Robust All&#8208;Polymer Organic Photovoltaic Cells Enabled by Optimized Fibril Network Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic photovoltaic (OPV) cells possessing high photovoltaic performance and mechanical robustness are promising candidates for flexible wearable devices. However, developing photoactive materials with good mechanical properties and photovoltaic performance so far remains challenging. In this work, a polymer donor PBDB&#8208;TF with a high weight&#8208;average molecular weight (Mw) was introduced to enable high&#8208;efficient all&#8208;polymer OPV cells featuring excellent mechanical reliability. By incorporating the high&#8208;Mw PBDB&#8208;TF as a third component into the PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT blend, the bulk heterojunction morphology is finely tuned with a more compact &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking distance, affording efficient pathways for charge transport as well as mechanical stress dissipation. Hence, all&#8208;polymer OPV cells based on the ternary blend film demonstrate a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with an outstanding fill factor of 0.796. The flexible OPV cell delivers a decent PCE of 16.5% with high mechanical stability. Our results present a promising strategy to address the mechanical properties and boost the photovoltaic performance of all&#8208;polymer OPV cells.

         <title>Matching Bidentate Ligand Anchoring: an Accurate Control Strategy for Stable Single&#8208;Atom/ZIF Nanocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The high&#8208;loading MN4 SACs (&gt;10 wt.%) with tunable coordination environments are designed using the matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy. The obtained Cu SA/ZIF nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800. Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms.








Abstract
Improving metal loading and controlling the coordination environment is nontrivial and challenging for single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs), which have the greatest atomic efficiency and largest number of interface sites. In this study, a matching bidentate ligand (MBL) anchoring strategy is designed for the construction of CuN4 SACs with tunable coordination environments (Cu loading range from 0.4 to15.4 wt.%). The obtained Cu SA/ZIF and Cu SA/ZIF*&#65279;&#65279; (0.4 wt.%) (ZIF and ZIF*&#160;= Zeolitic imidazolate framework with Matching bidentate N&#8208;ligands) nanocomposites exhibit superior performance in homo&#8208;coupling of phenyl acetylene under light irradiation (TON = 580, selectivity &gt; 99%), which is 22 times higher than that of Cu SA/NC&#8208;800 (NC = N&#8208;doped porous carbon). Experiments and density functional theory calculations confirmed that the specific Cu five&#8208;membered ring formed using the MBL anchoring strategy is the key to the immobilization of isolated Cu atoms. This strategy provides a basis for the construction of M SA/MOF, which has the potential to narrow the gap between experimental and theoretical catalysis, as further confirmed by the successful preparation of Fe SA/ZIF and Ni SA/ZIF.

         <title>A Therapeutic Nanovaccine that Generates Anti&#8208;Amyloid Antibodies and Amyloid&#8208;specific Regulatory T Cells for Alzheimer's Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rapamycin&#8208;incorporated lipid nanoparticle containing amyloid&#8208;&#946; (LNP&#8208;R/A&#946;) attenuates neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in a transgenic rodent model of Alzheimer's disease (AD) by inducing tolerogenic dendritic cells and A&#946;&#8208;specific regulatory T cells, and generating anti&#8208;amyloid antibodies. Furthermore, LNP&#8208;R/A&#946; reduces T helper 1 cells in AD brains, implying lower risks of meningitis, which is the major reason for the failure of conventional A&#946; vaccines.








Abstract
Alzheimer's disease (AD), the most common cause of dementia, is a complex condition characterized by multiple pathophysiological mechanisms including amyloid&#8208;&#946; (A&#946;) plaque accumulation and neuroinflammation in the brain. The current immunotherapy approaches, such as anti&#8208;A&#946; monoclonal antibody (mAb) therapy, A&#946; vaccines, and adoptive regulatory T (Treg) cell transfer, target a single pathophysiological mechanism, which may lead to unsatisfactory therapeutic efficacy. Furthermore, A&#946; vaccines often induce T helper 1 (Th1) cell&#8208;mediated inflammatory responses. Here, a nanovaccine composed of lipid nanoparticles loaded with A&#946; peptides and rapamycin is developed, which targets multiple pathophysiological mechanisms, exhibits the combined effects of anti&#8208;A&#946; antibody therapy and adoptive A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cell transfer, and can overcome the limitations of current immunotherapy approaches for AD. The Nanovaccine effectively delivers rapamycin and A&#946; peptides to dendritic cells, produces both anti&#8208;A&#946; antibodies and A&#946;&#8208;specific Treg cells, removes A&#946; plaques in the brain, alleviates neuroinflammation, prevents Th1 cell&#8208;mediated excessive immune responses, and inhibits cognitive impairment in mice. The nanovaccine shows higher&#160;efficacy in cognitive recovery than an A&#946; vaccine. Unlike anti&#8208;A&#946; mAb therapy and adoptive Treg cell transfer, both of which require complicated and costly manufacturing processes, the nanovaccine is easy&#8208;to&#8208;prepare and cost&#8208;effective. The nanovaccines can represent a novel treatment option for AD.

Unlike anti-A&#946; mAb therapy and adoptive Treg cell transfer, both of which require complicated and costly manufacturing processes, the nanovaccine is easy-to-prepare and cost-effective. The nanovaccines can represent a novel treatment option for AD.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoheterojunction&#8208;Mediated Thermoelectric Strategy for Cancer Surgical Adjuvant Treatment and &#946;&#8208;elemene Combination Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Z&#8208;scheme heterojunction&#8208;based thermoelectric therapeutic strategy as either an independent cancer therapy or combination cancer therapy with &#946;&#8208;elemene is proposed. Moreover, the combination of heterojunction and hydrogel is administrated on the surface of the wound after surgery, achieving efficient residual tumor treatment and antibacterial effects.








Abstract
As an indispensable strategy for tumor treatment, surgery may cause two major challenges: tumor recurrence and wound infection. Here, a thermoelectric therapeutic strategy is provided as either an independent cancer therapy or surgical adjuvant treatment. Bi0.5Sb1.5Te3 (BST) and Bi2Te2.8Se0.2 (BTS) nanoplates composed of Z&#8208;scheme thermoelectric heterojunction (BST/BTS) are fabricated via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal processes. The contact between BST and BTS constructs an interfacial electric field due to Fermi energy level rearrangement, guiding electrons in the conductive band (CB) of BTS combine with the holes in the valance band (VB) of BST, leaving stronger reduction/oxidation potentials of electrons and holes in the CB of BST and the VB of BTS. Moreover, under a mild temperature gradient, another self&#8208;built&#8208;in electric field is formed facilitating the migration of electrons and holes to their surfaces. Based on the PEGylated BST/BTS heterojunction, a novel thermoelectric therapy platform is developed through intravenous injection of BST/BTS and external cooling of the tumors. This thermoelectric strategy is also proved effective for combination cancer therapy with &#946;&#8208;elemene. Moreover, the combination of heterojunction and hydrogel is administrated on the wound after surgery, achieving efficient residual tumor treatment and antibacterial effects.

         <title>Engineering Co&#63743;P Alloy Foil to a Well&#8208;Designed Integrated Electrode Toward High&#8208;Performance Electrochemical Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying strategy is developed to address existing drawbacks of binder&#8208;free nanostructured integrated electrodes toward electrochemical energy storage. Accordingly, a Co&#63743;P alloy&#8208;derived Co(OH)x/Co2P mesoporous electrode not only loads over 3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3 of active materials, but also exhibits excellent electron&#8208;ion mixed conductivity and high mechanical stability, making it a promising candidate for practical applications.








Abstract
Nanostructured integrated electrodes with binder&#8208;free design show great potential to solve the ever&#8208;growing problems faced by currently commercial lithium&#8208;ion batteries such as insufficient power and energy densities. However, there are still many challenging problems limiting practical application of this emerging technology, in particular complex manufacturing process, high fabrication cost, and low loading mass of active material. Different from existing fabrication strategies, here using a Co&#63743;P alloy foil as a precursor&#160; a simple neutral salt solution&#8208;mediated electrochemical dealloying method to well address the above issues is demonstrated. The resultant freestanding mesoporous np&#8208;Co(OH)x/Co2P product possesses not only active compositions of high specific capacity and large electrode packing density (&gt;3.0&#160;g cm&#8722;3) to meet practical capacity requirements, high&#8208;conductivity and well&#8208;developed nanoporous framework to achieve simultaneously fast ion and electron transfer, but also interconnected ligaments and suitable free space to ensure strong structural stability. Its comprehensively excellent electrochemical energy storage (EES) performances in both lithium/sodium&#8208;ion batteries and lithium&#8208;ion capacitors can further illustrate the effectiveness of the integrated electrode preparation strategy, such as remarkable reversible specific capacities/capacitances, dominated pseudo&#8208;capacitive EES mechanism, and ultra&#8208;long cycling life. This study provides new insights into preparation and design of high&#8208;performance integrated electrodes for practical applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Agglomeration of Single&#8208;Atom Platinum in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pt single atoms (SAs) supported on TiO2 surfaces form clusters and undergo reduction (by photogenerated electrons) to a metallic state over the course of a photocatalytic reaction. Although this process affects &gt;90% of the loaded Pt SAs, Pt SA&#8208;TiO2 photocatalysts show stable H2 production. Density&#8208;functional theory calculations suggest Pt SA interaction with H adatom as a destabilizing factor.








Abstract
With recent advances in the field of single&#8208;atoms (SAs) used in photocatalysis, an unprecedented performance of atomically dispersed co&#8208;catalysts has been achieved. However, the stability and agglomeration of SA co&#8208;catalysts on the semiconductor surface may represent a critical issue in potential applications. Here, the photoinduced destabilization of Pt SAs on the benchmark photocatalyst, TiO2, is described. In aqueous solutions within illumination timescales ranging from few minutes to several hours, light&#8208;induced agglomeration of Pt SAs to ensembles (dimers, multimers) and finally nanoparticles takes place. The kinetics critically depends on the presence of sacrificial hole scavengers and the used light intensity. Density&#8208;functional theory&#160;calculations attribute the light induced destabilization of the SA Pt species to binding of surface&#8208;coordinated Pt with solution&#8208;hydrogen (adsorbed H atoms), which consequently weakens the Pt SA bonding to the TiO2 surface. Despite the gradual aggregation of Pt SAs into surface clusters and their overall reduction to metallic state, which involves &gt;90% of Pt SAs, the overall photocatalytic H2 evolution remains virtually unaffected.

         <title>Discovery of Type II Interlayer Trions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first observation of Type II interlayer trions by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8208;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure is reported. Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions.








Abstract
In terms of interlayer trions, electronic excitations in van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) can be classified into Type I (i.e., two identical charges in the same layer) and Type II (i.e., two identical charges in the different layers). Type I interlayer trions are investigated theoretically and experimentally. By contrast, Type II interlayer trions remain elusive in vdWHs, due to inadequate free charges, unsuitable band alignment, reduced Coulomb interactions, poor interface quality, etc. Here, the first observation of Type II interlayer trions is reported by exploring band alignments and choosing an atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic system&#8212;monolayer WSe2/bilayer pentacene heterostructure (1L&#160;+&#160;2L HS). Both positive and negative Type II interlayer trions are electrically tuned and observed via PL spectroscopy. In particular, Type II interlayer trions exhibit in&#8208;plane anisotropic emission, possibly caused by their unique spatial structure and anisotropic charge interactions, which is highly correlated with the transition dipole moment of pentacene. The results pave the way to develop excitonic devices and all&#8208;optical circuits using atomically thin organic&#8211;inorganic bilayers.

A novel injectable class of flexible electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on remote magnetic actuation is developed. Its functionality, stability, extensibility, and biocompatibility for large&#8208;scale electrophysiological monitoring the neural activities of distinct neuron populations in the rodent brains are successfully demonstrated in this study.








Abstract
Flexible microelectronics capable of straightforward implantation, remotely controlled navigation, and stable long&#8208;term recording hold great promise in diverse medical applications, particularly in deciphering complex functions of neural circuits in the brain. Existing flexible electronics, however, are often limited in bending and buckling during implantation, and unable to access a large brain region. Here, an injectable class of electronics with stable recording, omnidirectional steering, and precise navigating capabilities based on magnetic actuation is presented. After simple transcriptional injection, the rigid coatings are biodegraded quickly and the bundles of magnetic&#8208;nanoparticles&#8208;coated microelectrodes become separated, ultra&#8208;flexible, and magnetic actuated for further minimally invasive&#160;three&#8208;dimensional&#160;interpenetration in the brain. As proof of concept, this paradigm&#8208;shifting approach is demonstrated for selective and multiplexed neural activities recording across distant regions in the deep rodent brains. Coupling with optogenetic neural stimulation, the unique capabilities of this platform in electrophysiological readouts of projection dynamics in vivo are also demonstrated. The ability of these miniaturized, remotely controllable, and biocompatible ferromagnetic flexible electronics to afford minimally invasive manipulations in the soft tissues of the mammalian brain foreshadows applications in other organ systems, with great potential for broad utility in biomedical science and engineering.

         <title>Extracellular Matrix Secretion Mechanically Reinforces Interlocking Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a bioinspired interlocking interface produced by electrostatic flocking. Such an interface can sustain cell growth, and the perpendicularly aligned flocked fibers can mitigate cell death caused by compression. In addition, the secreted extracellular matrix from seeded cells significantly enhances the mechanical properties of the interface.








Abstract
Drawing inspiration for biomaterials from biological systems has led to many biomedical innovations. One notable bioinspired device, Velcro, consists of two substrates with interlocking ability. Generating reversibly interlocking biomaterials is an area of investigation, as such devices can allow for modular tissue engineering, reversibly interlocking biomaterial interfaces, or friction&#8208;based coupling devices. Here, a biaxially interlocking interface generated using electrostatic flocking is reported. Two electrostatically flocked substrates are mechanically and reversibly interlocked with the ability to resist shearing and compression forces. An initial high&#8208;throughput screen of polyamide flock fibers with varying diameters and fiber lengths is conducted to elucidate the roles of different fiber parameters on scaffold mechanical properties. After determining the most desirable parameters via weight scoring, polylactic acid (PLA) fibers are used to emulate the ideal scaffold for in vitro use. PLA flocked scaffolds are populated with osteoblasts and interlocked. Interlocked flocked scaffolds improved cell survivorship under mechanical compression and sustained cell viability and proliferation. Additionally, the compression and shearing resistance of cell&#8208;seeded interlocking interfaces increased with increasing extracellular matrix deposition. The introduction of extracellular matrix&#8208;reinforced interlocking interfaces may serve as binders for modular tissue engineering, act as scaffolds for engineering tissue interfaces, or enable friction&#8208;based couplers for biomedical applications.

         <title>A MgFe&#8208;LDH Nanosheet&#8208;Incorporated Smart Thermo&#8208;Responsive Hydrogel with Controllable Growth Factor Releasing Capability for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel composed of bone morphogenetic protein 2&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide&#160;nanosheets and platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB&#8208;loaded chitosan/silk fibroin hydrogel is designed and constructed to achieve the sequential release of dual growth factors and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions for highly efficient bone regeneration.








Abstract
Although growth factor (GF)&#8208;loaded hydrogels have been explored as promising materials in repairing bone defects, it still remains challenging to construct smart hydrogels with excellent gelation/mechanical properties as well as controllable GF releasing capability. Herein, the incorporation of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP&#8208;2)&#8208;functionalized MgFe&#8208;layered double hydroxide (LDH) nanosheets into chitosan/silk fibroin (CS) hydrogels loaded with platelet&#8208;derived growth factor&#8208;BB (PDGF&#8208;BB) to construct a smart injectable thermo&#8208;responsive hydrogel (denoted as CSP&#8208;LB), which can achieve a burst release of PDGF&#8208;BB and a sustained release of BMP&#8208;2, for highly efficient bone regeneration is reported. The incorporation of MgFe&#8208;LDH in CS hydrogel not only shortens the gelation time and decreases sol&#8211;gel transition temperature, but also enhances the mechanical property of the hydrogel. Because of the sequential release of dual&#8208;GFs and sustained release of bioactive Mg2+/Fe3+ ions, the in vitro experiments prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel exhibits excellent angiogenic and osteogenic properties compared with the CS hydrogel. In vivo experiments further prove that the CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel can significantly enhance bone regeneration with higher bone volume and mineral density than that of the CS hydrogel. This smart thermo&#8208;sensitive CSP&#8208;LB hydrogel possesses excellent gelation capability and angiogenic and osteogenic properties, thus providing a promising minimally invasive solution for bone defect treatment.

         <title>Photonic Crystal&#8208;Integrated Optoelectronic Devices with Naked&#8208;Eye Visualization and Digital Readout for High&#8208;Resolution Detection of Ultratrace Analytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photonic crystal&#8208;based optoelectronic device is developed for rapid and real&#8208;time digital monitoring of ultratrace analytes with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, which is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases, such as the quick identification of diabetes from ultratrace glucose in sweat.








Abstract
The detection of ultratrace analytes is highly desirable for the non&#8208;invasive monitoring of human diseases. However, a major challenge is fast, naked&#8208;eye, high&#8208;resolution ultratrace detection. Herein, a rectangular 3D composite photonic crystal (PC)&#8208;based optoelectronic device is first designed that combines the sensitivity&#8208;enhancing effects of PCs and optoelectronic devices with fast and real&#8208;time digital monitoring. A crack&#8208;free, centimeter&#8208;scale, mechanically robust ellipsoidal composite PCs with sufficient hardness and modulus, even exceeding most plastics and aluminum alloys, are developed. The high mechanical strength of ellipsoidal composite PCs allows them to be hand&#8208;machined into rectangular geometries that can be conformally covered with the centimeter&#8208;scale flat light&#8208;detection area without interference from ambient light, easily integrating 3D composite PC&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. The PC&#8208;based device's signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio increases dramatically from original 30&#8211;40 to &#8776;60&#8211;70&#160;dB. Droplets of ultratrace analytes on the device are identified by fast digital readout within seconds, with detection limits down to 5&#160;&#181;L, enabling rapid identification of ultratrace glucose in artificial sweat and diabetes risk. The developed 3D PC&#8208;based sensor offers the advantages of small size, low cost, and high reliability, paving the way for wider implementation in other portable optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Perturbed Multiresonance TADF Emitter Enables High&#8208;Efficiency and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off Nonsensitized OLEDs with Pure Green Gamut</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8208;perturbation approach is developed for boosting the reverse intersystem crossing rate of multiresonance type B&#8211;N molecule by utilizing the spin&#8211;orbit coupling effect of a gold atom. The resultant emitter exhibits a short&#8208;lived thermally activated delayed fluorescence, which enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance nonsensitized organic light&#8208;emitting diode with a high external quantum efficiency, little efficiency roll&#8208;off, and good color purity.








Abstract
Multiresonance (MR)&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters based on B&#8208; and N&#8208;embedded polycyclic aromatics are desirable for ultrahigh&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their high photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) and narrow bandwidth. But the reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) rates of MR&#8208;TADF emitters are usually small, resulting in severe device efficiency roll&#8208;off at high brightness. To solve this issue, a sensitizer for the MR&#8208;TADF emitter has been required. Herein, a new MR&#8208;TADF emitter is developed through coordination of Au with B/N&#8208;embedded polycyclic ligand. Benefitting from the Au perturbation, the RISC rate is dramatically accelerated to 2.3 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, leading to delayed fluorescence lifetime as short as 4.3 &#181;s. Meanwhile, the PLQY of 95% and full width at half maximum of 39&#160;nm (0.18&#160;eV) are essentially unchanged after metal coordination. Therefore, a high PLQY, short delayed fluorescence lifetime, and high color purity are concurrently realized in a single TADF emitter. Accordingly, vacuum&#8208;deposited OLEDs exhibit high&#8208;performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Furthermore, solution&#8208;processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll&#8208;off.

Accordingly, vacuum-deposited OLEDs exhibit high-performance electroluminescence with a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 35.8% without sensitization. The EQE is maintained as high as 32.3% at 10&#160;000&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Furthermore, solution-processed OLED based on the emitter also achieves excellent performance with a maximum EQE of 25.7% and a small efficiency roll-off.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Overcoming the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier for Gene Therapy via Systemic Administration of GSH&#8208;Responsive Silica Nanocapsules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of glutathione&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) is created and screened for brain gene editing via systemic administration. SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass intact blood&#8211;brain barrier, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics (mRNA, Cas9 mRNA/sgRNA, and Cas9/sgRNA ribonucleoprotein).








Abstract
CRISPR genome editing can&#160;potentially treat the root causes of many genetic diseases, including central nervous system (CNS) disorders. However, the promise of brain&#8208;targeted therapeutic genome editing relies on the efficient delivery of biologics bypassing the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), which represents a major challenge in the development of CRISPR therapeutics.&#160;We&#160;created and screened&#160;a library of glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive silica nanocapsules (SNCs) for brain targeted delivery of biologics via systemic administration. In vivo studies demonstrate that systemically delivered SNCs conjugated with glucose and rabies virus glycoprotein peptide under glycemic control can efficiently bypass the intact BBB, enabling brain&#8208;wide delivery of various biologics including CRISPR genome editors targeting different genes in both Ai14 reporter mice and wild&#8208;type mice. In particular, up to 28% neuron editing via systemic delivery of Cre mRNA in Ai14 mice, up to 6.1% amyloid precursor protein (App) gene editing (resulting in 19.1% reduction in the expression level of intact APP), and up to 3.9% tyrosine hydroxylase (Th) gene editing (resulting in 30.3% reduction in the expression level of TH) in wild&#8208;type mice are observed. This versatile SNC nanoplatform may offer a novel strategy for the treatment of CNS disorders including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's disease.

         <title>Bionic Engineered Protein Coating Boosting Anti&#8208;Biofouling in Complex Biological Fluids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel engineered BSA@PSBMA protein (bovine serum albumin, BSA and poly(sulfobetaine methacrylate), PSBMA) is developed for surface&#8208;independent coating and to remove the intrinsic limitation of native proteins as antifouling coatings in complex biological environments. High&#8208;efficient resistance to various biofoulants in complex conditions is achieved through using a bionic &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; design to tune the interfacial interactions at the molecular scale.








Abstract
Implantable medical devices have been widely applied in diagnostics, therapeutics, organ restoration, and other biomedical areas, but often suffer from dysfunction and infections due to irreversible biofouling. Inspired by the self&#8208;defensive &#8220;vine&#8208;thorn&#8221; structure of climbing thorny plants, a zwitterion&#8208;conjugated protein is engineered via grafting sulfobetaine methacrylate (SBMA) segments on native bovine serum albumin (BSA) protein molecules for surface coating and antifouling applications in complex biological fluids. Unlike traditional synthetic polymers of which the coating operation requires arduous surface pretreatments, the engineered protein BSA@PSBMA (PolySBMA conjugated BSA) can achieve facile and surface&#8208;independent coating on various substrates through a simple dipping/spraying method. Interfacial molecular force measurements and adsorption tests demonstrate that the substrate&#8208;foulant attraction is significantly suppressed due to strong interfacial hydration and steric repulsion of the bionic structure of BSA@PSBMA, enabling coating surfaces to exhibit superior resistance to biofouling for a broad spectrum of species including proteins, metabolites, cells, and biofluids under various biological conditions. This work provides an innovative paradigm of using native proteins to generate engineered proteins with extraordinary antifouling capability and desired surface properties for bioengineering applications.

         <title>A Molecular Engineering Strategy for Achieving Blue Phosphorescent Carbon Dots with Outstanding Efficiency above 50%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through a molecular engineering strategy, more functional groups are modified on the surface of carbon dots embedded in the rigid silica network, which not only greatly boosts the spin&#8208;orbit coupling, improves the intersystem crossing rate, but also stabilizes the triplet excited state, resulting in efficient blue phosphorescence.








Abstract
Highly efficient emission has been a long&#8208;lasting pursuit for carbon dots (CDs) owing to their enormous potential in optoelectronic applications. Nevertheless, their room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) performance still largely lags behind their outstanding fluorescence emission, especially in the blue&#160;spectral region. Herein, high&#8208;efficiency blue RTP CDs have been designed and constructed via a simple molecular engineering strategy, enabling CDs with an unprecedented phosphorescence quantum efficiency of to 50.17% and a long lifetime of 2.03 s. This treating route facilitates the formation of high&#8208;density (n, &#960;*) configurations in the CD &#960;&#8211;&#960; conjugate system through the introduction of abundant functional groups, which can evoke a strong spin&#8208;orbit coupling and further promote the intersystem crossing from singlet to triplet excited states and radiative recombination from triplet excited states to ground state. With blue phosphorescent CDs as triplet donors, green, red, and white afterglow composites are successfully fabricated via effective phosphorescence F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer. Importantly, the color temperature of the white afterglow emission can be widely and facilely tuned from cool white to pure white and warm white. Moreover, advanced information encryption, light illumination, and afterglow/dynamic visual display have been demonstrated when using these multicolor&#8208;emitting CD&#8208;based afterglow systems.

         <title>Identification of the Origin for Reconstructed Active Sites on Oxyhydroxide for Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites and proposing oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism during oxygen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The regulation of atomic and electronic structures of active sites plays an important role in the rational design of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) catalysts toward electrocatalytic hydrogen generation. However, the precise identification of the active sites for surface reconstruction behavior during OER remains elusive for water&#8208;alkali electrolysis. Herein, irreversible reconstruction behavior accompanied by copper dynamic evolution for cobalt iron layered double hydroxide (CoFe LDH) precatalyst to form CoFeCuOOH active species with high&#8208;valent Co species is reported, identifying the origin of reconstructed active sites through operando UV&#8208;Visible (UV&#8211;vis), in situ Raman, and X&#8208;ray absorption fine&#8208;structure (XAFS) spectroscopies. Density functional theory analysis rationalizes this typical electronic structure evolution causing the transfer of intramolecular electrons to form ligand holes, promoting the reconstruction of active sites. Specifically, unambiguous identification of active sites for CoFeCuOOH is explored by in situ 18O isotope&#8208;labeling differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and supported by theoretical calculation, confirming mechanism switch to oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;site mechanism (OVSM) pathway on lattice oxygen. This work enables to elucidate the vital role of dynamic active&#8208;site generation and the representative contribution of OVSM pathway for efficient OER performance.

         <title>In Situ Interweaved High Sulfur Loading Li&#8211;S Cathode by Catalytically Active Metalloporphyrin Based Organic Polymer Binders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is proposed and excellent performance is achieved in Li&#8211;S battery.








Abstract
The elaborate design of powerful Li&#8211;S binders with extended&#8208;functions like polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li+ hopping/transferring in addition to robust adhesion&#8208;property has remained a challenge. Here, an in situ cathode&#8208;interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin based covalent&#8208;bonding organic polymer (M&#8208;COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is reported for the first time. Thus&#8208;produced functional binders possess excellent mechanical&#8208;strengths, polysulfides adsorption/catalysis, and Li+ hopping/transferring ability. Specifically, the modulus of Mn&#8208;COP can reach up to &#8776;54.60&#160;GPa (&#8776;40 times higher than poly(vinylidene fluoride)) and the relative cell delivers a high initial&#8208;capacity (1027 mAh g&#8208;1, 1 C and 913 mAh g&#8208;1, 2 C), and excellent cycling&#8208;stability for &gt;1000 cycles even at 4 C. The utilization&#8208;rate of sulfur can reach up to 81.8% and the electrodes based on these powerful binders can be easily scale&#8208;up fabricated (&#8776;20&#160;cm in a batch&#8208;experiment). Noteworthy, Mn&#8208;COP based cell delivers excellent capacities at a high sulfur&#8208;loading (8.6&#160;mg cm&#8208;2) and low E/S ratio (5.8&#160;&#181;L mg&#8208;1).

&lt;p&gt;An in situ cathode-interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin organic polymer (M-COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is proposed and excellent performance is achieved in Li&#8211;S battery.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The elaborate design of powerful Li&#8211;S binders with extended-functions like polysulfides adsorption/catalysis and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hopping/transferring in addition to robust adhesion-property has remained a challenge. Here, an in situ cathode-interweaving strategy based on metalloporphyrin based covalent-bonding organic polymer (M-COP, M = Mn, Ni, and Zn) binders is reported for the first time. Thus-produced functional binders possess excellent mechanical-strengths, polysulfides adsorption/catalysis, and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; hopping/transferring ability. Specifically, the modulus of Mn-COP can reach up to &#8776;54.60&#160;GPa (&#8776;40 times higher than poly(vinylidene fluoride)) and the relative cell delivers a high initial-capacity (1027 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 1 C and 913 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 2 C), and excellent cycling-stability for &amp;gt;1000 cycles even at 4 C. The utilization-rate of sulfur can reach up to 81.8% and the electrodes based on these powerful binders can be easily scale-up fabricated (&#8776;20&#160;cm in a batch-experiment). Noteworthy, Mn-COP based cell delivers excellent capacities at a high sulfur-loading (8.6&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) and low E/S ratio (5.8&#160;&#181;L mg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). In addition, theoretical calculations reveal the vital roles of metalloporphyrin and thiourea-groups in enhancing the battery-performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetoelectric Coupling in Atomically Thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A space&#8208;confined CVD strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature ferrimagnetism. The strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. The robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3.








Abstract
2D multiferroics with magnetoelectric coupling combine the magnetic order and electric polarization in a single phase, providing a cornerstone for constructing high&#8208;density information storages and low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption spintronic devices. The strong interactions between various order parameters are crucial for realizing such multifunctional applications, nevertheless, this criterion is rarely met in classical 2D materials at room&#8208;temperature. Here an ingenious space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition strategy is designed to synthesize atomically thin non&#8208;layered &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3 single crystals and disclose the room&#8208;temperature long&#8208;range ferrimagnetic order. Interestingly, the strong ferroelectricity and its switching behavior are unambiguously discovered in atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3, accompanied with an anomalous thickness&#8208;dependent coercive voltage. More significantly, the robust room&#8208;temperature magnetoelectric coupling is uncovered by controlling the magnetism with electric field and verifies the multiferroic feature of atomically thin &#949;&#8208;Fe2O3. This work not only represents a substantial leap in terms of the controllable synthesis of 2D multiferroics with robust magnetoelectric coupling, but also provides a crucial step toward the practical applications in low&#8208;energy&#8208;consumption electric&#8208;writing/magnetic&#8208;reading devices.

         <title>Engineered Phage with Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Photosensitizer in Cocktail Therapy against Sepsis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer with phages is developed that not only selectively identifies bacterial species but also shows a powerful ability to kill pathogenic bacteria in sepsis diagnosis and treatment. This synergetic therapy strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy offers a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
Sepsis, a widely recognized disease, is characterized by multiple pathogen infections. Therefore, it is imperative to develop methods that can efficiently identify and neutralize pathogen species. Phage cocktail therapy utilizes the host specificity of phages to adapt to infect resistant bacteria. However, its low sterilization stability efficiency and lack of imaging units seriously restrict its application. Here, a novel strategy combining the aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer (AIE&#8208;PS) TBTCP&#8208;PMB with phages through a nucleophilic substitution reaction between benzyl bromide and sulfhydryl groups to remove pathogenic bacteria for sepsis treatment is proposed. This strategy retains the phage's host specificity while possessing AIE&#8208;PS characteristics with a fluorescence imaging function and reactive&#160;oxygen&#160;species (ROS) for detecting and sterilizing bacteria. This synergetic strategy combining phage cocktail therapy and photodynamic therapy (PDT) shows a strong &#8220;1&#160;+&#160;1&#160;&gt;&#160;2&#8221; bactericidal efficacy and superior performance in sepsis mouse models with good biocompatibility. Furthermore, the strategy can quickly diagnose blood infections of clinical blood samples. This simple and accurate strategy provides a promising therapeutic platform for rapid pathogen detection and point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnosis. Moreover, it presents a new method for expanding the library of antibacterial drugs to develop new strain identification and improve infectious disease treatment, thereby demonstrating strong translational potential.

         <title>Electron&#8208;Phonon Coupling Suppression by Enhanced Lattice Rigidity in 2D Perovskite Single Crystals for High&#8208;Performance X&#8208;Ray Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 2D perovskite single crystal is designed by introducing a diamine molecule DGA into the lead&#8208;iodine octahedron. Compared with the monoamine o&#8208;F&#8208;PEA, the DGA strongly interacts with the [PbI6]4&#8208;, improving the lattice stiffness, reducing electron&#8208;phonon coupling and lattice distortion, and making the corresponding device to achieve high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and high X&#8208;ray sensitivity (4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2).








Abstract
2D Dion&#8722;Jacobson (DJ) perovskite single crystals (PSCs) usually demonstrate better X&#8208;ray detection performance than Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) PSCs. However, the mechanism of the improved performance is still elusive. Here, by the aid of strong interactions between dimethylbiguanide (DGA) and PbI2, a novel DJ&#8208;perovskitoid (DGA)PbI4 is designed. From the comparison of (DGA)PbI4 to other 2D PSCs, it is discovered that the tiniest lattice distortion and increased hydrogen bonds in the atom&#8208;scaled analysis strengthen lattice rigidity and weaken electron&#8208;phonon coupling to suppress disordered scattering of carriers, resulting in significantly improved carrier transport and stability. Therefore, high carrier mobility (78.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a pronounced sensitivity of 4869.0 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1cm&#8722;2 are achieved using (DGA)PbI4, which are the best in 2D Pb&#8208;based PSC devices to date. Finally, the (DGA)PbI4 devices exhibit good spatial resolution in X&#8208;ray imaging and excellent long&#8208;term stability to work as a promising candidate for medical diagnostics and nondestructive determination.

         <title>Rapid Melt&#8208;Quenching Enables General Synthesis of High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts with Bicontinuous Nanoporous Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile approach is developed for synthesizing nanoporous metal compound supported single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal loadings, representing a several&#8208;fold improvement of metal loading compared to benchmarks. Libraries of SACs can be synthesized by choosing various combinations of supporting matrixes and single atoms, thus achieving the synergistic catalysis.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have attracted extensive attention due to their unique atomic structures and extraordinary activities in catalyzing chemical reactions. However, the lack of general and efficient approaches for producing high&#8208;density single atoms on suitably tailored supporting matrixes hinders their industrial applications. Here, a rapid melt&#8208;quenching strategy with high throughput to synthesize single atoms with high metal&#8208;atom loadings of up to 9.7 wt% or 2.6 at% on nanoporous metal compounds is reported, representing several&#8208;fold improvements compared to benchmarks in the literature. Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high&#8208;temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid&#8208;quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized using the strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted H2 production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single&#8208;atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single&#8208;atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.

Mechanism characterizations reveal that the high-temperature melting provides the essential liquid environment and activation energy to achieve the atomization of metals, while the following rapid-quenching pins the isolated metal atoms and stabilizes the coordination environment. In comparison with carbon-supported single-atom catalysts, various collaboration combinations of single atoms and nanoporous metal compounds can be synthesized using the strategy, thus achieving efficient hydrazine oxidation-assisted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. This synthesis protocol is highly compatible with automatic operation, which provides a feasible and general route to design and manufacture specific single-atom catalysts with tunable atomic metal components and supporting matrixes, thus promoting the deployment of single-atom catalysts for various energy technology applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Partially Nitrided Ni Nanoclusters Achieve Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO at Ultralow Overpotential</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes supported partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters catalyst achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2RR to CO, and reaches CO Faraday efficiency &#8805; 99.0% at overpotential of only 166&#160;mV, much lower than of the isolated Ni single&#8208;atom catalyst, with the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9%.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising strategy to lower CO2 emission while producing value&#8208;added chemicals. A great challenge facing CO2RR is how to improve energy efficiency by reducing overpotentials. Herein, partially nitrided Ni nanoclusters (NiNx) immobilized on N&#8208;doped carbon nanotubes (NCNT) for CO2RR are reported, which achieves the lowest onset overpotential of 16&#160;mV for CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO and the highest cathode energy efficiency of 86.9% with CO Faraday efficiency &gt;99.0% to date. Interestingly, NiNx/NCNT affords a CO generation rate of 43.0&#160;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 at a low potential of &#8722;0.572&#160;V (vs RHE). DFT calculations reveal that the NiNx nanoclusters favor *COOH formation with lower Gibbs free energy than isolated Ni single&#8208;atom, hence lowering CO2RR overpotential. As NiNx/NCNT is applied to a membrane electrode assembly system coupled with oxygen evolution reaction, a cell voltage of only 2.13&#160;V is required to reach 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, with total energy efficiency of 62.2%.

         <title>Natural Shaping of Acellular Dermal Matrices for Implant&#8208;Based Breast Reconstruction via Expansile Kirigami</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An expansile kirigami acellular dermal matrix (ADM) offers natural shaping of implant&#8208;based breast reconstruction with securely holding the implant. Guided by finite element modeling, stretchability, curvature, and elasticity of kirigami ADM is precisely controlled. The developed kirigami ADM potentially offers patient&#8208;specific reconstruction while minimizing operative time and cost.








Abstract
To complete a successful and aesthetic breast reconstruction for breast cancer survivors, tissue reinforcing acellular dermal matrices (ADMs) are widely utilized to create slings/pockets to keep breast implants or autologous tissue transfer secured against the chest wall in the desired location. However, ADM sheets are 2D and cannot completely cover the entire implant without wrinkles. Here, guided by finite element modeling, a kirigami strategy is presented to cut the ADM sheets with locally and precisely controlled stretchability, curvature, and elasticity. Upon expansion, a single kirigami ADM sheet can conformably wrap the implant regardless of the shape and size, forming a natural teardrop shape; contour cuts prescribe the topographical height and fractal cuts in the center ensures horizontal expandability and thus conformability. This kirigami ADM can provide support to the reconstructed breast in the desired regions, potentially offering optimal outcomes and patient&#8208;specific reconstruction, while minimizing operative time and cost.

         <title>Rational Design of All&#8208;Inorganic Assemblies with Bright Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer assembly route to achieve circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with both high anisotropic factor and photoluminescence quantum yield is developed. The excellent CPL performance arises from the efficient generation of linearly polarized luminescence from the aligned quantum nanorods and then transformation to CPL by an inorganic nanowire&#8208;based quarter&#8208;wave plate.








Abstract
Materials with exceptional circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) are important in multi&#8208;field applications such as 3D display, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, sensing, spin electronics, etc. Although CPL properties have been widely investigated ranging from the traditional chiral organic molecules to the emerging chiral inorganic nanomaterials and their assemblies, a trade&#8208;off between the luminescence efficiency (quantum yield, &#981;) and the luminescence dissymmetry factor (glum) is always the bottleneck for all the chiral luminescent materials, which hinders their practical application. Herein, a new route to overcome the paradox through rationally assembling quantum nanorods and ultrathin inorganic nanowires into ordered multilayer structures is reported, achieving both high &#981; and glum. In these assembled structures, the aligned quantum nanorods emit linearly polarized light that is then transformed to CPL by the aligned ultrathin nanowire assemblies with precisely controlled phase retardation. This method is universal and readily extended to versatile 1D nanomaterials, paving the way for the practical applications of CPL active materials.

         <title>Scalable Alkaline Zinc&#8208;Iron/Nickel Hybrid Flow Battery with Energy Density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1</title>

Combining the electrochemical reactions and the redox&#8208;mediated chemical reaction, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with energy density up to 200&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and the upscaling of kW&#8208;scale stack with a high performance for 600&#160;h are demonstrated, which will inspire the development of next&#8208;generation cost&#8208;effective flow batteries based on novel redox chemistries for electrochemical energy storage applications.








Abstract
Achieving net&#8208;zero emissions requires low&#8208;cost and reliable energy storage devices that are essential to deploy renewables. Alkaline zinc&#8208;based flow batteries such as alkaline zinc&#8208;iron (or nickel) flow batteries are well suited for energy storage because of their high safety, high efficiency, and low cost. Nevertheless, their energy density is limited by the low solubility of ferro/ferricyanide and the limited areal capacity of sintered nickel electrodes. Here, combining the electrochemical reaction with the chemical reaction of ferro/ferricyanide couple in a homemade nickel electrode, an alkaline zinc&#8208;iron/nickel hybrid flow battery with a high energy density of 208.9&#160;Wh&#160;L&#8722;1 and an energy efficiency of 84.7% at a high current density of 80&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is reported. The reversible chemical reactions between dual couples are proven to stabilize the nickel electrode by promoting the activation of the nickel electrode and further preventing the formation of &#947;&#8208;NiOOH. A kW&#8208;scale stack is demonstrated by the integration of ferro/ferricyanide couple with nickel electrode, delivering a coulombic efficiency of 98% and an energy efficiency of 89% at 40&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. This work demonstrates a promising pathway for constructing and upscaling flow batteries with high energy density and low cost.

         <title>Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&#63743;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&#63743;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi19S27Cl3&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO2.








Abstract
Obtaining multi&#8208;carbon products via CO2&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron&#8208;mediated C&#63743;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO2&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&#63743;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi19S27Cl3, is presented which selectively converts CO2&#160;to a C2&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi19S27Cl3. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&#63743;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate. Formation of these intermediates is experimentally mapped by in&#160;situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy and further confirmed by theoretical calculation.

     alt="Intrinsic Charge Polarization in Bi19S27Cl3 Nanorods Promotes Selective C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C Coupling Reaction during Photoreduction of CO2 to Ethanol"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The concept of intrinsic charge polarization has been efficiently exploited for the C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling reaction. The selected catalyst, Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;has three suitably arranged Bi centers with asymmetric charge distribution. The charge polarized Bi centers facilitate the formation of COCOH* intermediate which has been realized as the crucial step for synthesizing ethanol from CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Obtaining multi-carbon products via CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;photoreduction is a major catalytic challenge involving multielectron-mediated C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C bond formation. Complex design of multicomponent interfaces that are exploited to achieve this chemical transformation, often leads to untraceable deleterious changes in the interfacial chemical environment affecting CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;conversion efficiency and product selectivity. Alternatively, robust metal centers having asymmetric charge distribution can effectuate C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling reaction through the stabilization of intermediates, for desired product selectivity. However, generating inherent charge distribution in a single component catalyst is a difficult material design challenge. Here, a novel photocatalyst, Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is presented which selectively converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;to a C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;product, ethanol, in high yield under visible light irradiation. Structural analysis through transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy reveals the presence of charge polarized bismuth centers in Bi&lt;sub&gt;19&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;27&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The intrinsic electric field induced by charge polarized bismuth centers renders better separation efficiency of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pair. Furthermore, charge polarized centers yield better adsorption of CO* intermediate and accelerate the rate determining C&lt;span class='icomoon'&gt;&#63743;&lt;/span&gt;C coupling step through the formation of OCCOH intermediate.

         <title>Highly Sensitive and Cost&#8208;Effective Polymeric&#8208;Sulfur&#8208;Based Mid&#8208;Wavelength Infrared Linear Polarizers with Tailored Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot Resonance</title>

         <dc:description>
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur can replace expensive commercial semiconductors and chalcogenides for mid&#8208;wavelength infrared applications. Here, a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective polymeric&#8208;sulfur&#8208;based bilayer wire&#8208;grid linear polarizer with a pitch of 400&#160;nm is successfully demonstrated by systematically investigated thermal nanoimprinting conditions and precisely changed spacer thickness to control Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot resonance.








Abstract
Inverse&#8208;vulcanized polymeric sulfur has received considerable attention for application in waste&#8208;based infrared (IR) polarizers with high polarization sensitivities, owing to its high transmittance in the IR region and thermal processability. However, there have been few reports on highly sensitive polymeric sulfur&#8208;based polarizers by replication of pre&#8208;simulated dimensions to achieve a high transmission of the transverse magnetic field (TTM) and extinction ratio (ER). Herein, a 400&#8208;nanometer&#8208;pitch mid&#8208;wavelength infrared bilayer linear polarizer with self&#8208;aligned metal gratings is introduced on polymeric sulfur gratings integrated with a spacer layer (SM&#8208;polarizer). The dimensions of the SM&#8208;polarizer can be closely replicated using pre&#8208;simulated dimensions via a systematic investigation of thermal nanoimprinting conditions. Spacer thickness is tailored from 40 to 5100&#160;nm by adjusting the concentration of polymeric sulfur solution during spin&#8208;coating. A tailored spacer thickness can maximize TTM in the broadband MWIR region by satisfying Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonance. The SM&#8208;polarizer yields TTM of 0.65, 0.59, and 0.43 and ER of 3.12 &#215; 103, 5.19 &#215; 103, and 5.81 &#215; 103 at 4&#160;&#181;m for spacer thicknesses of 90, 338, and 572&#160;nm, respectively. This demonstration of a highly sensitive and cost&#8208;effective SM&#8208;polarizer opens up exciting avenues for infrared polarimetric imaging and for applications in polarization manipulation.

         <title>3D&#8208;Bioprinted Phantom with Human Skin Phototypes for Biomedical Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with different Fitzpatrick scale values are reported to understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. The absorption and scattering coefficients of the skin phantoms are similar to real human skin. This approach may have value in understanding differences in the performance of biomedical optics as a function of skin tone.








Abstract
3D&#8208;bioprinted skin&#8208;mimicking phantoms with skin colors ranging across the Fitzpatrick scale are reported. These tools can help understand the impact of skin phototypes on biomedical optics. Synthetic melanin nanoparticles of different sizes (70&#8211;500&#160;nm) and clusters are fabricated to mimic the optical behavior of melanosome. The absorption coefficient and reduced scattering coefficient of the phantoms are comparable to real human skin. Further the melanin content and distribution in the phantoms versus real human skins are validated via photoacoustic (PA) imaging. The PA signal of the phantom can be improved by: 1) increasing melanin size (3&#8211;450&#8208;fold), 2) increasing clustering (2&#8211;10.5&#8208;fold), and 3) increasing concentration (1.3&#8211;8&#8208;fold). Then, multiple biomedical optics tools (e.g., PA, fluorescence imaging, and photothermal therapy) are used to understand the impact of skin tone on these modalities. These well&#8208;defined 3D&#8208;bioprinted phantoms may have value in translating biomedical optics and reducing racial bias.

         <title>Metal Anodes with Ultrahigh Reversibility Enabled by the Closest Packing Crystallography for Sustainable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The ever&#8208;growing annual electricity generated from sustainable and intermittent energy such as wind and solar power requires the cost effective and reliable electrochemical energy storage. Rechargeable batteries based on multivalent metal anodes such as Zn, Al and Fe, taking advantages of large&#8208;scale production and affordable cost, have been emerged as promising candidates. However, the uncontrollable dendrite&#8208;like metal deposition on regular substrate caused by disordered metal crystallization usually leads to premature failure of batteries and even safety concern when the dendrite bridges the electrodes. Here we report that a series of metal anodes (Zn, Co, Al, Ni, Fe) with multiple crystal structures (hcp, fcc, bcc) can achieve dendrite&#8208;free and epitaxial deposition on single&#8208;crystal Cu(111) substrates enabled by the closest packing crystallography. Moreover, the closest packed facets are aligned horizontally with the substrates, resulting in compact planar construction and excellent chemical stability even at an unprecedented current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2. The full cells under a practical anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio of 2.3 show cycling life span over 800 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of &gt;99.9%. The universal approach of regulating metal electrodeposition in this work is expected to boost the development of emerging sustainable energy storage/conversion devices.

         <title>Engineering the Electronic Structure of Single Atom Iron Sites with Boosted Oxygen Bifunctional Activity for Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable zinc&#8208;air batteries typically require efficient, durable, and inexpensive bifunctional electrocatalysts to support oxygen reduction/evolution reactions (ORR/OER). However, sluggish kinetics and mass transportation challenges must be addressed and these catalysts&#8217; performance is to be enhanced. Herein, we develop a strategy to fabricate a catalyst comprised of atomically dispersed iron atoms supported on a mesoporous nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon support (Fe SAs/NC) with accessible metal sites and optimized electronic metal&#8208;support interactions. Both the experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the engineered electronic structures of metal active sites can regulate the charge distribution of Fe centers to optimize the adsorption/desorption of oxygenated intermediates. The Fe SAs/NC containing Fe1N4O1 sites achieved remarkable ORR activity over the entire pH range, with half&#8208;wave potentials of 0.93&#160;V, 0.83&#160;V, and 0.75&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in alkaline, acidic, and neutral electrolytes, respectively. In addition, it demonstrated a promising low overpotential of 320&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for OER in alkaline conditions. The zinc&#8208;air battery assembled with Fe SAs/NC exhibited superior performance than that of Pt/C+RuO2 counterpart in terms of peak power density, specific capacity, and cycling stability. These findings demonstrate the importance of the electronic structure engineering of metal sites in directing catalytic activity.

         <title>Engineered Switchable&#8208;Wettability Surfaces for Multi&#8208;Path Directional Transportation of Droplets and Subaqueous Bubbles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface featured by switchable wettability is proposed to achieve the multi&#8208;path parallel directional transportation of both water droplets and subaqueous bubbles. This programmable, easy&#8208;fabricable, highly&#8208;efficient, and cost&#8208;effective fluidic system with strong robustness against structural defects is ready for versatile fluid transportation supporting both liquid&#8208; and gas&#8208;phase matters.








Abstract
Conventional engineered surfaces for fluid manipulation are hindered by the set wettability, and thus they can only achieve spontaneous transport of single&#8208;phase fluid, namely liquid or gas. Moreover, fluid transport systems that are robust to path defects have yet to be fully explored. Here, unprecedentedly, a universal wettability switching strategy is developed for achieving programmable directional transport of both droplets and subaqueous bubbles on a dumbbell&#8208;patterned functional surface (DPFS), featuring in strong robustness, high efficiency, and effective cost. By tuning the superwettability of DPFS through octadecyltrichlorosilane treatment and ultraviolet&#8208;C selective irradiation, the transport fluid can alternate between liquid and gas. The material's switchable superwettability regulates the fluid directed dynamics within the confined pattern, in which the sustaining fluid propelling relies on the surface energy difference between the starting and terminal sites. This enables the construction of multiple channels, which works synergistically with ultralow&#8208;volume&#8208;loss transport to impart the fluidic system with strong robustness against path defects. Underlying the completion of complex microfluidics tasks, spatially&#8208;selective cooling devices and subaqueous gas microreactors are successfully demonstrated. This energy&#8208;consumption&#8208;free fluid transport system opens a new avenue for on&#8208;chip programmable fluid manipulation, promoting innovative applications requiring rational control of two&#8208;phase fluid transport.

         <title>Chiral MoSe2 Nanoparticles for Ultrasensitive Monitoring of Reactive Oxygen Species In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, and acute hepatitis, and the early diagnosis of these diseases by quantification of ROS is critical for the curable treatment of patients. Here, a novel probe was developed based on chiral molybdenum diselenide (MoSe2) nanoparticles (NPs) modified by the fluorescence molecule, cyanine 3 (Cy3). Chiral MoSe2 NPs showed intensive circular dichroism (CD) signals at 390&#160;nm and 550&#160;nm, whereas the fluorescence signal of Cy3 at 560&#160;nm was quenched by MoSe2 NPs. With the presence of ROS, the novel probe reacted with ROS and then oxidated rapidly, resulting in decreased CD signals and the recovery of Cy3 fluorescence signals. With the help of ROS&#8208;related CD and fluorescent dual&#8208;mode signals, the limit of detection (LOD) of CD signals and fluorescence signals in living cells was 0.0093&#160;nmol/106 cells and 0.024&#160;nmol/106 cells, respectively. The high selectivity and sensitivity to ROS in complex biological environments was attributed to the Mo4+ and Se2&#8722; oxidation reaction on the surface of the NPs. Furthermore, chiral MoSe2 NPs was able to monitor the levels of ROS in vivo by fluorescence signals. Collectively, this strategy offers a new approach for ROS detection and has the potential to inspire others to explore chiral nanomaterials as potential biosensors to investigate biological events.

         <title>Microenvironmentally responsive chemotherapeutic prodrugs and CHEK2 inhibitors self&#8208;assembled micelles: protecting fertility and enhancing chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Chemotherapy is a widely used and effective adjuvant treatment for cancer, and it has unavoidable damage to female fertility, with statistics showing 38% of women who have received chemotherapy are infertile. How to reduce fertility toxicity while enhancing the oncologic chemotherapy is a clinical challenge. Herein, we developed the co&#8208;delivery micelles (BML@PMP), which are composed of a reduction&#8208;sensitive paclitaxel prodrug (PMP) for chemotherapy and a CHEK2 inhibitor (BML277) for both fertility protection and chemotherapy enhancement. BML@PMP achieves fertility protection through three actions. (1) Due to the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect, BML@PMP is more enriched in the tumor, while very little in the ovary (about 1/10th of the tumor). (2) Glutathione (GSH) triggers the release of PTX, and with low levels of GSH in the ovary, the amount of PTX released in the ovary is correspondingly reduced. (3) BML277 inhibits oocyte apoptosis by inhibiting the CHEK2&#8208;TAp63&#945; pathway. Because of the different downstream targets of CHEK2 in tumor cells and oocytes, BML277 also enhances chemotherapeutic efficacy by reducing DNA damage repair which is activated through the CHEK2 pathway. This bidirectional effect of CHEK2 inhibitor&#8208;based co&#8208;delivery system represents a promising strategy for improving oncology treatment indices and preventing chemotherapy&#8208;associated fertility damage.

         <title>Rational Design of Platinum&#8208;Bismuth Sulfide Schottky Heterostructure for Sonocatalysis&#8208;Mediated Hydrogen Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is unavoidably limited by the tumor microenvironment although many sonosensitizers have been developed to improve them to a certain extent. Given this, we propose a concept of sonocatalytic hydrogen evolution and define it as an oxygen&#8208;independent therapeutics. To demonstrate the feasibility of the concept, narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor bismuth sulfide (Bi2S3) are selected as sonocatalysts and platinum (Pt) nanoparticles are grown in situ to optimize their catalytic performance. In this nanocatalytic system, Pt nanoparticles help to capture sono&#8208;excited electrons, whereas intratumoral overexpressed glutathione (GSH) as natural hole sacrificial agents can consume sono&#8208;excited holes, which greatly improves charge separation efficiency and promote the controllable and sustainable H2 generation. Even under hypoxic conditions, the Pt&#8208;Bi2S3 nanoparticles can also produce sufficient H2 under US irradiation. Mechanistically, mitochondrial dysfunction caused by H2 and intratumoral redox homeostasis destruction by GSH depletion synergistically damage DNA to induce tumor cells apoptosis. At the same time, Pt nanoparticles and holes can also trigger the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide into O2 to relieve tumor hypoxia, thus synergistic with GSH depletion to reverse tumor immunosuppressive microenvironment. The proposed sonocatalysis mediated therapy will provide a new direction to realize facile and efficient cancer therapy.

         <title>Biohybrid 3D Printing of a Tissue&#8208;Sensor Platform for Wireless, Real&#8208;Time, and Continuous Monitoring of Drug&#8208;Induced Cardiotoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Drug&#8208;induced cardiotoxicity is regarded as a major hurdle in the early stages of drug development. Although there are various methods for preclinical cardiotoxicity tests, they cannot completely predict the cardiotoxic potential of a compound due to the lack of physiological relevance. Recently, three&#8208;dimensional engineered heart tissue (EHT) has been used to investigate cardiac muscle functions as well as pharmacological effects by exhibiting physiological auxotonic contractions. However, there is still no adequate platform for continuous monitoring to test acute and chronic pharmacological effects in vitro. Here, we firstly introduce a biohybrid 3D printing method for fabricating a tissue&#8208;sensor platform, composed of a bi&#8208;pillar&#8208;grafted strain gauge sensor and EHT. Two pillars were three&#8208;dimensionally printed as grafts onto a strain gauge&#8208;embedded substrate to promote the EHT contractility and guide the self&#8208;assembly of the EHTs along with the strain gauge. In addition, the integration of a wireless multi&#8208;channel electronic system allowed for continuous monitoring of the EHT contractile force by the tissue&#8208;sensor platform and, ultimately, for the observation of the acute and chronic drug effects of cardiotoxicants. In summary, we expect biohybrid 3D printing technology to be a potential fabrication method to provide a next&#8208;generation tissue&#8208;sensor platform for an effective drug development process.

Abstract
Effective repolarization of macrophages has emerged as a promising approach for anti&#8208;cancer therapy. However, there are very few studies on the effect of reprogramming macrophages from M2 phenotype to M1 phenotype without reconversion while maintaining an activated M1 phenotype. Moreover, these immunomodulatory methods have serious drawbacks due to the activation of normal monocytic cells. Therefore, it remains a challenge to selectively reprogram tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) without systemic toxicities. Here, 
X&#8208;ray guided and triggered remote 
control of a 
CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing system (X&#8208;CC9) that exclusively activates therapeutic agents at tumor sites was established. Under X&#8208;ray irradiation, X&#8208;CC9 selectively enhanced M2&#8208;to&#8208;M1 repolarization within the tumor microenvironment, and significantly improved anti&#8208;tumor efficacy with robust immune responses in two animal models. This strategy provides an ideal method for improving the safety of the macrophage polarization and may constitute a promising immunotherapy strategy.

         <title>Macroscale Fabrication of Lightweight and Strong Porous Carbon Foams Through Template&#8208;Coating pair Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Manufacturing of low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams can benefit the construction, transportation, and packaging industries. One successful route to lightweight and mechanically strong carbon foams involves pyrolysis of polymeric architectures, which is inevitably accompanied by drastic volumetric shrinkage (usually &gt;98%). As such, a challenge of these materials lies in maintaining bulk dimensions of building struts that span orders of magnitude difference in length scale from centimeters to nanometers. This work demonstrates fabrication of macroscale low&#8208;density&#8208;high&#8208;strength carbon foams that feature exceptional dimensional stability through pyrolysis of robust template&#8208;coating pairs. The template serves as the architectural blueprint and contains strength&#8208;imparting properties (e.g., high node density, small strut dimensions); it is composed of a low char&#8208;yielding porous polystyrene backbone with a high carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The coating serves to imprint and transcribe the template architecture into pyrolytic carbon; it is composed of a high char&#8208;yielding conjugated polymer with a relatively low carbonization&#8208;onset temperature. The designed carbonization mismatch enables inheritance of the structure, while the decomposition mismatch affords hollow struts, minimizing density. The carbons synthesized through this new framework exhibit remarkable dimensional stability (&#8764;80% dimension retention; &#8764;50% volume retention) and some of the highest specific strengths (&#8764;0.13 GPa g&#8722;1cm3) among reported carbon foams derived from porous polymer templates.

         <title>Cooperative Electronic Structure Modulator of Fe Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalyst for High Energy and Long Cycle Li&#8208;S Pouch Cell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;energy and long cycle lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) are reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&#8722;1 multi&#8208;stacked Li&#8208;S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8764;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), N/P (2.3) ratios, and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&#8722;2). The high&#8208;activity Fe SAC was designed by manipulating their local environments using electron&#8208;exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene&#8208;like&#8208;S (&#8208;S) and oxidized&#8208;S (&#8208;SO2), adjacent to Fe SACs, promoted the kinetics of the Li2S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe d&#8208;orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The &#8208;S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas &#8208;SO2 withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe d&#8208;orbital energy level can be modulated by the different &#8208;SO2/&#8208;S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.

&lt;p&gt;High-energy and long cycle lithium-sulfur (Li-S) pouch cells are limited by the insufficient capacities and stabilities of their cathodes under practical electrolyte/sulfur (E/S), electrolyte/capacity (E/C), and negative/positive (N/P) ratios. Herein, an advanced cathode comprising highly active Fe single-atom catalysts (SACs) are reported to form 320.2&#160;W h kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; multi-stacked Li-S pouch cells with total capacity of &#8764;1 A h level, satisfying low E/S (3.0), E/C (2.8), N/P (2.3) ratios, and high sulfur loadings (8.4&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;). The high-activity Fe SAC was designed by manipulating their local environments using electron-exchangeable binding (EEB) sites. Introducing EEB sites comprising two different types of S species, namely, thiophene-like-S (-S) and oxidized-S (-SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), adjacent to Fe SACs, promoted the kinetics of the Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S redox reaction by providing additional binding sites and modulating the Fe &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital levels via electron exchange with Fe. The -S donates the electrons to the Fe SACs, whereas -SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; withdraws electrons from the Fe SACs. Thus, the Fe &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;-orbital energy level can be modulated by the different -SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/-S ratios of the EEB site, controlling the electron donating/withdrawing characteristics. This desirable electrocatalysis is maximized by the intimate contact of the Fe SACs with the S species, which are confined together in porous carbon.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Highly Stretchable and Biocompatible Wrinkled Nanoclay&#8208;Composite Hydrogel with Enhanced Sensing Capability for Precise Detection of Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
It is challenging to balance high biocompability with good mechanical&#8208;electrical sensing performance, especially when triggered inflammatory stress response after in&#8208;vivo implantation. Herein, we reported a bioinspired wrinkle&#8208;reinforced adaptive nanoclay&#8208;interlocked soft strain&#8208;sensor based on a highly stretchable and elastic ionic&#8208;conductive hydrogel. This novel nanoclay&#8208;composite hydrogel exhibited excellent tensile properties and high sensing capacity with steady and reliable sensing performance due to the structural&#8208;mechanical&#8208;electrical integrity of the nanoclay crosslinked and nano&#8208;reinforced interpenetrating network. The incorporation of amphiphilic ions provides the hydrogel with significant protein resistance, reducing its non&#8208;specific adsorption to proteins upon implantation and improving its biosafety as an implanted device and maintaining the authenticity of the sensing results. Based on the revealed sensing enhanced mechanism based on hierarchical ordered structures, as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application, it is for the first time to demonstrate this hydrogel sensor can accurately localize the region where myocardial infarction occurs and may become a novel strategy for real&#8208;time monitoring of pathological changes in heart disease.

         <title>A Novel &#8220;Inside&#8208;Out&#8221; Intraocular Nanomedicine Delivery Mode for Nanomaterials Biological Effects Enhanced Choroidal Neovascularization Occlusion and Microenvironment Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is commonly used in choroidal neovascularization (CNV) treatment due to the superior light transmittance of the eye. However, PDT often leads to surrounding tissue damage and further microenvironmental deterioration, including exacerbated hypoxia, inflammation, and secondary neovascularization. Herein, Pt nanoparticles (NPs) and Au NPs decorated zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) nanoplatform is developed to load indocyanine green (ICG) for precise PDT and microenvironment amelioration, which can penetrate the internal limiting membrane through M&#252;ller cells endocytosis and target to CNV by surface grafted cyclo(Arg&#8208;Gly&#8208;Asp&#8208;d&#8208;Phe&#8208;Lys) after intravitreal injection. The excessive H2O2 in the CNV microenvironment is catalyzed by catalase&#8208;like Pt NPs for hypoxia relief and enhanced PDT occlusion of neovascular. Meanwhile, Au NPs show significant anti&#8208;inflammatory and anti&#8208;angiogenesis properties in regulating macrophages and blocking vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Compared with verteporfin treatment, the mRNA expressions of hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; and VEGF in the nanoplatform group are downregulated by 90.2% and 81.7%, respectively. Therefore, the nanoplatform realizes a comprehensive CNV treatment effect based on the high drug loading capacity and biosafety. The CNV treatment mode developed in this work provides a valuable reference for treating other diseases with similar physiological barriers that limit drug delivery and similar microenvironment.

         <title>Correlated Rattling of Sodium&#8208;Chains Suppressing Thermal Conduction in Thermoelectric Stannides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tin&#8208;based intermetallics with tunnel frameworks containing zigzag Na chains that excite correlated rattling impinging on the framework phonons are attractive as thermoelectric materials owing to their low lattice thermal conductivity. The correlated rattling of Na atoms in the zigzag chains and the origin of the low thermal conductivity is uncovered via experimental and computational analyses. The Na atoms behave as oscillators along the tunnel, resulting in substantial interactions between Na atoms in the chain and between the chain and framework. In these intermetallic compounds, a shorter inter&#8208;rattler distance results in lower thermal conductivity, suggesting that phonon scattering by the correlated rattling Na&#8208;chains is enhanced. These results provide new insights into the behavior of thermoelectric materials with low thermal conductivity and suggest strategies for the development of such materials that utilize the correlated rattling.

         <title>Symmetry&#8208;guaranteed high carrier mobility in quasi&#8208;2D thermoelectric semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Quasi&#8208;two&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;2D) semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next&#8208;generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties. However, most quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors experimentally synthesized so far have relatively low carrier mobility, preventing the achievement of exceptional power output. To break through this obstacle, we propose a route based on the crystal symmetry arguments to facilitate the charge transport of quasi&#8208;2D semiconductors, in which the horizontal mirror symmetry is found to vanish the electron&#8208;phonon coupling strength mediated by phonons with purely out&#8208;of&#8208;plane vibrational vectors. This is demonstrated in ZrBeSi&#8208;type quasi&#8208;2D systems, where the representative sample Ba1.01AgSb shows a high room&#8208;temperature hole mobility of 344 cm2 V&#8210;1 S&#8210;1, a record value among quasi&#8208;2D polycrystalline thermoelectrics. Accompanied by intrinsically low thermal conductivity, an excellent p&#8208;type zT of &#8764;1.3 is reached at 1012 K, which is the highest value in ZrBeSi&#8208;type compounds. Our work uncovers the relation between electron&#8208;phonon coupling and crystal symmetry in quasi&#8208;2D systems, which broadens the horizon to develop high mobility semiconductors for electronic and energy conversion applications.

&lt;p&gt;Quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) semiconductors have garnered immense research interest for next-generation electronics and thermoelectrics due to their unique structural, mechanical, and transport properties.

         <title>Optically Excited Lasing in a Cavity&#8208;Based, High&#8208;Current&#8208;Density Quantum Dot Electroluminescent Device</title>

Abstract
Laser diodes based on solution&#8208;processable materials could benefit numerous technologies including integrated electronics and photonics, telecommunication, and medical diagnostics. An attractive system for implementing these devices is colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs). The progress towards a QD laser diode has been hampered by fast nonradiative Auger decay of optical&#8208;gain&#8208;active multicarrier states, fast device degradation under high current densities required for laser action, and unfavorable competition between optical gain and optical losses in a multicomponent device stack. Here we resolve some of these challenges and demonstration optically excited lasing from a fully functional high&#8208;current density electroluminescent (EL) devices with an integrated optical resonator. This advance has become possible due to excellent optical gain properties of compact, continuously graded QDs and a refined device architecture, which allows for highly efficient light amplification in a thin, EL&#8208;active QD layer.

         <title>Reviving Oxygen Evolution Electrocatalysis of Bulk La&#8208;Ni Intermetallics via Gaseous Hydrogen Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Herein a hydrogen processing strategy has been developed to enable bulk LaNi5 to attain high activity and long&#8208;term stability towards electrocatalytic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). By a combination of in situ Raman and quasi in situ X&#8208;ray absorption (XAS) spectra, secondary electron&#8208;excited scanning transmission electron microscopic (STEM) patterns as well as the Rietveld method and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, it was discovered that hydrogen&#8208;induced lattice distortion, grain refinement, and particle cracks dictated the effective reconstruction of LaNi5 surface into porous hetero&#8208;nanoarchitecture composed of uniformly confined active &#947;&#8208;NiOOH nanocrystals by La(OH)3 layer in alkaline OER process. This significantly optimizes the charge transfer, structural integrity, active site exposure, and adsorption energy towards the reaction intermediates. Benefiting from these merits, the overpotential (322&#160;mV) at 100&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 for the hydrogen&#8208;processed OER catalyst deposited on nickel foam was reduced by 104&#160;mV as compared to the original phase. Notably, it exhibited remarkable stability for 10 days at an industrial&#8208;grade current density of more than 560&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in alkaline media.

         <title>Picoperovskites: the Smallest Conceivable Isolated Halide Perovskite Structures Formed Within Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskite structures are revolutionising the design of optoelectronic materials, including solar cells, light emitting diodes and photovoltaics when formed at the quantum scale. We report four isolated sub&#8208;nm, or pico&#8208;scale, halide perovskite structures formed inside &#8764;1.2&#8208;1.6&#160;nm single walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) by melt insertion from CsPbBr3 and lead&#8208;free CsSnI3. Three directly relate to the ABX3 perovskite archetype while a fourth is a perovskite&#8208;like lamellar structure with alternating Cs4 and polyhedral Sn4Ix layers. In &#8764;1.4&#160;nm diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 forms Cs3PbIIBr5 nanowires one ABX3 unit cell in cross section with the Pb2+ oxidation state maintained by ordered Cs+ vacancies. Within &#8764;1.2&#160;nm diameter SWCNTs, CsPbBr3 and CsSnI3 form inorganic polymer&#8208;like bilayer structures 1/4 an ABX3 unit cell in cross&#8208;section with systematically reproduced ABX3 stoichiometry. Producing these smallest halide perovskite structures at their absolute synthetic cross&#8208;sectional limit enables quantum confinement effects with first&#8208;principles calculations demonstrating band gap widening compared to corresponding bulk structural forms.

         <title>Dissolvable Self&#8208;locking Microneedle Patches Integrated with Immunomodulators for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Advancements in micro&#8208;resolution 3D printers have significantly facilitated the development of highly complex mass&#8208;producible drug delivery platforms. Conventionally, due to the limitations of micro&#8208;milling machineries, dissolvable microneedles (MNs) were mainly fabricated in cone&#8208;shaped geometry with limited drug delivery accuracy. Herein, to overcome the limitations of conventional MNs, a novel projection micro&#8208;stereolithography 3D printer&#8208;based self&#8208;locking MN for precise skin insertion, adhesion, and transcutaneous microdose drug delivery is presented. The geometry of self&#8208;locking MN consists of a sharp skin&#8208;penetrating tip, a wide skin interlocking body, and a narrow base with mechanical supports fabricated over a flexible hydrocolloid patch to improve the accuracy of skin penetration into irregular surfaces. Melanoma, a type of skin cancer, was selected as the model for the investigation of self&#8208;locking MNs due to its irregular and uneven surface. In vivo immunotherapy efficacy was evaluated by integrating SD&#8208;208, a novel transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; (TGF&#8208;&#946;) inhibitor that suppresses the proliferation and metastasis of tumors, and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (&#945;PD&#8208;L1 Ab), an immune checkpoint inhibitor that induces T cell&#8208;mediated tumor cell death, into self&#8208;locking MNs and compared with intratumoral injection. Evaluation of (&#945;PD&#8208;L1 Ab)/SD&#8208;208 delivery effectiveness in B16F10 melanoma&#8208;bearing mice model confirmed significantly improved dose efficacy of self&#8208;locking MNs compared with intratumoral injection.

Abstract
To maintain a reliable lithium deposition and extraction on lithium metal anode during charging/discharging, surface modification poses a promising way in reaching high energy&#8208;density batteries. We report a dual&#8208;layer interphase that consists of an in&#8208;situ formed lithium carboxylate organic layer and an ultra&#8208;thin BF3&#8208;doped monolayer Ti3C2 MXene on Li metal surface. The honeycomb&#8208;structured organic layer increases the wetting of electrolyte due to the large surface area, leading to a thin solid electrolyte interface (SEI). While the BF3&#8208;doped monolayer MXene provides abundant active sites for lithium homogeneous nucleation and growth, resulting in about 50% reduced thickness of inorganic&#8208;rich components among the SEI layer. A low overpotential of less than 30&#160;mV over 1000&#160;h cycling in symmetric cells was received. The functional BF3 groups along with the excellent electronic conductivity and smooth surface of the MXene greatly reduce the lithium plating/stripping energy barrier, enabling a dendrite&#8208;free lithium metal anode. The battery with the dual&#8208;layer coated lithium metal (D&#8208;Li) as anode displayed greatly improved electrochemical performance. The battery paired with NMC811 exhibited a high initial Coulombic efficiency (CE) of 82.1%. A high capacity&#8208;retention of 175.4 mAh/g at 1.0 C was achieved after 350 cycles. After long 500 cycles, a reliable capacity was still remained while the cell with un&#8208;modified Li metal quickly dropped to below 74.2 mAh/g. In a pouch cell with a capacity of 475 mAh, the battery still exhibited a high discharge capacity of 165.6 mAh/g with a capacity retention of 90.2% after 200 cycles, while the cell with pure Li metal decreased to 80.5%. In contrast to the fast capacity decay of pure Li metal, the battery using NCA as cathode also displayed excellent capacity retention in both coin and pouch cells. The BF3&#8208;doped 2D MXene dual&#8208;layer modified surface provides an effective approach in stabilizing Li metal anode in rapidly growing large energy&#8208;density batteries.

         <title>Strategies to Extend the Lifetime of Perovskite Down&#8208;conversion Films for Display Applications</title>

Abstract
Metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (PeNCs) have outstanding luminescent properties that are suitable for displays that have high color purity and high absorption coefficient; so they have been evaluated for application as light emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), light converters for down&#8208;conversion displays, and future near&#8208;eye augmented reality/virtual reality displays. However, PeNCs are chemically vulnerable to heat, light, and moisture, and these weaknesses must be overcome before devices that use PeNCs can be commercialized. This review examines strategies to overcome the low stability of PeNCs and thereby permit the fabrication of stable down&#8208;conversion films, and summarizes down&#8208;conversion&#8208;type display applications and future prospects. First, we examine methods to increase the chemical stability of PeNCs. Second, we review methods to encapsulate PeNC down&#8208;conversion films to increase their lifetime. Third, we summarize methods to increase the long&#8208;term compatibility of resin with PeNCs, and finally, how to secure stability using fillers added to the resin. Fourth, we then describe the method to manufacture down&#8208;conversion film and the procedure to evaluate their reliability for commercialization. Finally, we explore the prospects of a down&#8208;conversion system that exploits the properties of PeNCs and can be eventually employed to fabricate very fine patterns for high&#8208;resolution displays and for near&#8208;eye augmented reality (AR)/virtual reality (VR) devices.

         <title>Molecular Complementarity of Proteomimetic Materials for Target&#8208;Specific Recognition and Recognition&#8208;Mediated Complex Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As biomolecules essential for sustaining life, proteins are generated from long chains of 20 different &#945;&#8208;amino acids that are folded into unique three&#8208;dimensional structures. In particular, many proteins have molecular recognition functions owing to their binding pockets, which have complementary shapes, charges, and polarities for specific targets, making these biopolymers unique and highly valuable for biomedical and biocatalytic applications. Based on our understanding of protein structures and microenvironments, molecular complementarity can be exhibited by synthesizable and modifiable materials. This has prompted researchers to explore the proteomimetic potentials of a diverse range of materials, including biologically available peptides and oligonucleotides, synthetic supramolecules, inorganic molecules, and related coordination networks. To fully resemble a protein, proteomimetic materials perform the molecular recognition to mediate complex molecular functions, such as allosteric regulation, signal transduction, enzymatic reactions, and stimuli&#8208;responsive motions; this can also expand the landscape of their potential bio&#8208;applications. This review focuses on the recognitive aspects of proteomimetic designs derived for individual materials and their conformations. Recent progress provides insights to help guide the development of advanced protein mimicry with material heterogeneity, design modularity, and tailored functionality. The perspectives and challenges of current proteomimetic designs and tools are also discussed in relation to future applications.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Mediated Radiotherapy Remodels the Tumor Microenvironment to Enhance Antitumor Efficacy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) uses ionizing radiation to eradicate localized tumors and, in rare cases, control tumors outside of the irradiated fields via stimulating an antitumor immune response (abscopal effect). However, the therapeutic effect of RT is often limited by inherent physiological barriers of the tumor microenvironment (TME), such as hypoxia, abnormal vasculature, dense extracellular matrix (ECM), and an immunosuppressive TME. Thus, it is critical to develop new RT strategies that can remodel the TME to overcome radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression. In the past decade, high&#8208;Z element nanoparticles have been developed to increase radiotherapeutic indices of localized tumors by reducing X&#8208;ray doses and side effects to normal tissues and enhance abscopal effects by activating the TME to elicit systemic antitumor immunity. In this review, we will discuss the principles of RT and radiosensitization, the mechanisms of radio&#8208;resistance and immune suppression, and the use of various nanoparticles to sensitize RT and remodel TMEs for enhanced antitumor efficacy. We will also highlight the challenges in clinical translation of multi&#8208;functional TME&#8208;remodeling nanoradiosensitizers.

         <title>Over 19% Efficiency Organic Solar Cells by Regulating Multidimensional Intermolecular Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Research on organic solar cells (OSCs) has progressed through material innovation and device engineering. However, well&#8208;known and ubiquitous intermolecular interactions, and particularly their synergistic effects, have received little attention. Herein, we investigate the complicated relationship between photovoltaic conversion and multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the active layers. These interactions are dually regulated by side&#8208;chain isomerization and end&#8208;cap engineering of the acceptors. The phenylalkyl featured acceptors (LA&#8208;series) exhibited stronger crystallinity with preferential face&#8208;on interactions relative to the alkylphenyl attached isomers (ITIC&#8208;series). In addition, the PM6 and LA&#8208;series acceptors exhibited moderate donor/acceptor (D/A) interactions compared to those of the strongly interacting PM6/ITIC&#8208;series pairs, which helped to enhance phase separation and charge transport. Consequently, the output efficiencies of all LA series acceptors were over 14%. Moreover, LA&#8208;series acceptors showed appropriate compatibility, host/guest interactions, and crystallinity relationships with BTP&#8208;eC9, thereby leading to uniform and well&#8208;organized &#8220;alloy&#8208;like&#8221; mixed phases. In particular, the highly crystalline LA23 further optimized multiple interactions and ternary microstructures, which resulted in a high efficiency of 19.12%. Thus, these results highlight the importance of multidimensional intermolecular interactions in the photovoltaic performance of OSCs.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;Homojunction Organic Nonfullerene Photovoltaics Featuring Fundamentals Distinct from Bulk Heterojunctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nonfullerene organic solar cells based on quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor contents (&#8804;10 wt.%) are fabricated. A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.








Abstract
In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi&#8208;homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high&#8208;efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7&#8208;Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll&#8208;off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7&#8208;Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.

A complete picture of the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated, which is distinct from classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) ones.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to classical bulk heterojunction (BHJ) in organic solar cells (OSCs), the quasi-homojunction (QHJ) with extremely low donor content (&#8804;10 wt.%) is unusual and generally yields much lower device efficiency. Here, representative polymer donors and nonfullerene acceptors are selected to fabricate QHJ OSCs, and a complete picture for the operation mechanisms of high-efficiency QHJ devices is illustrated. PTB7-Th:Y6 QHJ devices at donor:acceptor (D:A) ratios of 1:8 or 1:20 can achieve 95% or 64% of the efficiency obtained from its BHJ counterpart at the optimal D:A ratio of 1:1.2, respectively, whereas QHJ devices with other donors or acceptors suffer from rapid roll-off of efficiency when the donors are diluted. Through device physics and photophysics analyses, it is observed that a large portion of free charges can be intrinsically generated in the neat Y6 domains rather than at the D/A interface. Y6 also serves as an ambipolar transport channel, so that hole transport as also mainly through Y6 phase. The key role of PTB7-Th is primarily to reduce charge recombination, likely assisted by enhancing quadrupolar fields within Y6 itself, rather than the previously thought principal roles of light absorption, exciton splitting, and hole transport.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Implantable Magnetic Vascular Scaffold for Circulating Tumor Cell Removal In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a new type of vascular&#8208;like ITD with artificial adhesion repertoires and a wireless magnetothermal response for high metastatic circulating tumor cell removal in vivo is proposed. The ITD implanted in the artery mainly comprises PLLA fibers encapsulated with FeCo@G and a 3D structure with HA and gelatin for the preparation of bioinspired adhesive sites.








Abstract
An integrated trapped device (ITD) capable of removal of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can assuage or even prevent metastasis. However, adhesion repertoires are ordinarily neglected in the design of ITDs, possibly leading to the omission of highly metastatic CTC and treatment failure. Here a vascular&#8208;like ITD with adhesive sites and wireless magnetothermal response to remove highly metastatic CTC in vivo is presented. Such a vascular&#8208;like ITD comprises circumferential well&#8208;aligned fibers and artificial adhesion repertoires and is optimized for magnetothermal integration. Continuous and repeated capture in a dynamic environment increases capture efficiency over time. Meanwhile, the heat generation of the ITD leads to the capture of CTC death owing to cell heat sensitivity. Furthermore, the constructed bioinspired ultrastructure of the ITD prevents vascular blockage and induces potential vascular regeneration. Overall, this work defines an extendable strategy for constructing adhesion repertoires against intravascular shear forces, provides a vascular&#8208;like ITD for reducing CTC counts, and is expected to alleviate the risk of cancer recurrence.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of High&#8208;Quality Graphene Films via Electrostatic&#8208;Repulsion Aligning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films are assembled from pristine graphene nanosheets via electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning where highly electronegative titania nanosheets play a key role. The obtained graphene films present significantly enhanced mechanical properties and electrical properties for electromagnetic interference shielding and thermal&#8208;management multifunctional applications in smart and wearable electronics.








Abstract
Assembling pristine graphene into freestanding films featuring high electrical conductivity, superior flexibility, and robust mechanical strength aims at meeting the all&#8208;around high criteria of new&#8208;generation electronics. However, voids and defects produced in the macroscopic assembly process of graphene nanosheets severely degrade the performance of graphene films, and mechanical brittleness often limits their applications in wide scenarios. To address such challenges, an electrostatic&#8208;repulsion aligning strategy is demonstrated to produce highly conductive, ultraflexible, and multifunctional graphene films. Typically, the high electronegativity of titania nanosheets (TiNS) induces the aligning of negatively charged graphene nanosheets via electrostatic repulsion in the film assembly. The resultant graphene films show fine microstructure, enhanced mechanical properties, and improved electrical conductivity up to 1.285 &#215; 105 S m&#8722;1. Moreover, the graphene films can withstand 5000 repeated folding without structural damage and electrical resistance fluctuation. These comprehensive improved properties, combined with the facile synthesis method and scalable production, make these graphene films a promising platform for electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding and thermal&#8208;management applications in smart and wearable electronics.

         <title>Supramolecular Engineering of Amorphous Porous Polymers for Rapid Adsorption of Micropollutants and Solar&#8208;Powered Volatile Organic Compounds Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular engineering of amorphous covalent triazine frameworks (CTFs) successfully generates hydrophilic porous materials, which exhibit an exceptional removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% of phenol derivatives) and excellent recyclability. The photothermal characteristics of oxidized CTFs show a high volatile organic compound (VOC) rejection rate (&#8776;98% of phenol). Synergistic interplay of high&#8208;performance adsorption and solar&#8208;driven evaporation enables complete removal (&gt;99.9%) of mixture of phenol derivatives.








Abstract
Freshwater shortage is becoming one of the most critical global challenges owing to severe water pollution caused by micropollutants and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). However, current purification technology shows slow adsorption of micropollutants and requires an energy&#8208;intensive process for VOCs removal from water. In this study, a highly efficient molecularly engineered covalent triazine framework (CTF) for rapid adsorption of micropollutants and VOC&#8208;intercepting performance using solar distillation is reported. Supramolecular design and mild oxidation of CTFs (CTF&#8208;OXs) enable hydrophilic internal channels and improve molecular sieving of micropollutants. CTF&#8208;OX shows rapid removal efficiency of micropollutants (&gt;99.9% in 10&#160;s) and can be regenerated several times without performance loss. Uptake rates of selected micropollutants are high, with initial pollutant uptake rates of 21.9&#160;g&#160;mg&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, which are the highest rates recorded for bisphenol A (BPA) adsorption. Additionally, photothermal composite membrane fabrication using CTF&#8208;OX exhibits high VOC rejection rate (up to 98%) under 1 sun irradiation (1&#160;kW&#160;m&#8722;2). A prototype of synergistic purification system composed of adsorption and solar&#8208;driven membrane can efficiently remove over 99.9% of mixed phenol derivatives. This study provides an effective strategy for rapid removal of micropollutants and high VOC rejection via solar&#8208;driven evaporation process.

         <title>Chemical Vapor Deposition of Quaternary 2D BiCuSeO p&#8208;Type Semiconductor with Intrinsic Degeneracy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets with heteroanionic crystal structure are synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method. Its intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy is systemically revealed and leveraged for fabricating 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors. These results significantly boost the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of tunnel devices.








Abstract
2D BiCuSeO is an intrinsic p&#8208;type degenerate semiconductor due to its self&#8208;doping effect, which possesses great potential to fabricate high&#8208;performance 2D&#8211;2D tunnel field&#8208;effect transistors (TFETs). However, the controllable synthesis of multinary 2D materials by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is still a challenge due to the restriction of thermodynamics. Here, the CVD synthesis of quaternary 2D BiCuSeO nanosheets is realized. As&#8208;grown BiCuSeO nanosheets with thickness down to &#8776;6.1&#160;nm (&#8776;7 layers) and domain size of &#8776;277&#160;&#181;m show excellent ambient stability. Intrinsic p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, capable of maintaining even in a few layers, is comprehensively unveiled. By varying the thicknesses and temperatures, the carrier concentration of BiCuSeO nanosheets can be adjusted in the range of 1019 to 1021 cm&#8722;3, and the Hall mobility of BiCuSeO is &#8776;191 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 (at 2 K). Furthermore, taking advantage of the p&#8208;type degeneracy of BiCuSeO, a prototypical BiCuSeO/MoS2 TFET is fabricated. The emergence of the negative differential resistance trend and multifunctional diodes by modulating the gate voltage and temperature reveal the great practical implementation potential of BiCuSeO nanosheets. These results pave way for the CVD synthesis of multinary 2D materials and rational design of high&#8208;performance tunnel devices.

         <title>Oral Supramolecular Adsorbent for Preventing Chemo&#8208;Induced Gastrointestinal Mucositis and Microbial Dysbiosis and for Enhancing Chemoimmunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An orally administered polymeric adsorbent (SPORA&#8208;SN9) that can selectively adsorb chemo exposure in the GI tract is developed. The SPORA&#8208;SN9 sharply decreases the toxic chemo content of the gastrointestinal (GI) lumen, thereby preventing chemo&#8208;induced GI mucositis and chemo&#8208;induced microbial dysbiosis. Interestingly, the protected gut microbiome improves the antitumor efficacy of the followed immune checkpoint blockade therapy.








Abstract
The addition of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) to cytotoxic chemotherapy has emerged as the first&#8208;line treatment for multiple cancers. Paradoxically, cytotoxic chemotherapy may limit the therapeutic potential of ICB by significantly impairing the largest immune organ, the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, and driving gut microbial dysbiosis. Here, an orally administered polymeric adsorbent containing a supramolecular motif (named SPORA&#8208;SN9) is reported, which can selectively remove chemotherapeutics from the GI tract, thereby preventing chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis and microbial dysbiosis and providing better chemoimmunotherapy synergy. By theoretical design and experimental screening of the molecular recognition motifs, SPORA&#8208;SN9 exhibits superior complexation capacity for doxorubicin and irinotecan and high selectivity over a range of commonly used combinational medications. In mouse models of chemotherapy&#8208;induced GI mucositis, SPORA&#8208;SN9 protects the integrity of the GI tissues and the homeostasis of the gut microbiota. Finally, the addition of SPORA&#8208;SN9 enhances the efficacy of chemoimmunotherapy in tumor&#8208;bearing mice. SPORA&#8208;SN9 offers a translational approach for supramolecular chemistry to modulate complex biosystems by selectively removing target substrates from the GI tract.

         <title>V&#8208;Doped Cu2Se Hierarchical Nanotubes Enabling Flow&#8208;Cell CO2 Electroreduction to Ethanol with High Efficiency and Selectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to ethanol is achieved in a flow&#8208;cell, which is enabled by V&#8208;doped Cu2Se hierarchical nanotubes. The hierarchical nanotubes meet the requirement for flow&#8208;cells while the V doping steers the reaction pathway toward ethanol production.








Abstract
CO2 electrocatalytic reduction (CO2ER) to multicarbon (C2+) products is heavily pursued because of their commercial values, and the efficiency and selectivity have both attracted tremendous attention. A flow&#8208;cell is a device configuration that can greatly enhance the conversion efficiency but requires catalysts to possess high electrical conductivity and gas permeability; meanwhile, the catalysts should enable the reaction pathway to specific products. Herein, it is reported that V&#8208;doped Cu2Se nanotubes with a hierarchical structure can be perfectly compatible with flow&#8208;cells and fulfil such a task, achieving CO2 electroreduction to ethanol with high efficiency and selectivity. As revealed by the experimental characterization and theoretical calculation, the substitutional vanadium doping alters the local charge distribution of Cu2Se and diversifies the active sites. The unique active sites promote the formation of bridge *COB and its further hydrogenation to *COH, and, as such, the subsequent coupling of *COH and *COL eventually generates ethanol. As a result, the optimal Cu1.22V0.19Se nanotubes can electrocatalyze CO2 to ethanol with a Faradaic efficiency of 68.3% and a partial current density of &#8722;207.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for the single liquid product of ethanol at &#8722;0.8&#160;V in a flow&#8208;cell. This work provides insights into the materials design for steering the reaction pathway toward C2+ products, and opens an avenue for flow&#8208;cell CO2ER toward a single C2+ liquid fuel.

         <title>Robust and Multifunctional Kirigami Electronics with a Tough and Permeable Aramid Nanofiber Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Designing robust and multifunctional kirigami electronics for wearable applications imposes strict restrictions on the constituent materials. In this work, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto the CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve measurements of physiological parameters.








Abstract
Kirigami designs are advantageous for the construction of wearable electronics due to their high stretchability and conformability on the 3D dynamic surfaces of the skin. However, suitable materials technologies that enable robust kirigami devices with desired functionality for skin&#8208;interfaces remain limited. Here, a versatile materials platform based on a composite nanofiber framework (CNFF) is exploited for the engineering of wearable kirigami electronics. The self&#8208;assembled fibrillar network involving aramid nanofibers and poly(vinyl alcohol) combines high toughness, permeability, and manufacturability, which are desirable for the fabrication of hybrid devices. Multiscale simulations are conducted to explain the high fracture resistance of the&#160;CNFF&#8208;based kirigami structures and provide essential guidance for the design, which can be further generalized to other kirigami devices. Various microelectronic sensors and electroactive polymers are integrated onto a CNFF&#8208;based materials platform to achieve electrocardiogram&#160;(ECG), electromyogram (EMG), skin&#8208;temperature measurements, and measurement of other physiological parameters. These mechanically robust, multifunctional, lightweight, and biocompatible kirigami devices can shed new insights for the development of advanced wearable systems and human&#8211;machine interfaces.

         <title>Oxygen Evolution Activity of Amorphous Cobalt Oxyhydroxides: Interconnecting Precatalyst Reconstruction, Long&#8208;Range Order, Buffer&#8208;Binding, Morphology, Mass Transport, and Operation Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Four different amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides and two crystalline cobalt oxides are studied in&#160;situ to deduce the role of the reconstruction conditions, the effect of the electrolyte, and structure&#8211;activity relations for near&#8208;neutral water oxidation. Multiple aspects are considered and interconnected, deducing a comprehensive concept for the different electrocatalytic performances, including mass transport.








Abstract
Nanocrystalline or amorphous cobalt oxyhydroxides (CoCat) are promising electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). While having the same short&#8208;range order, CoCat phases possess different electrocatalytic properties. This phenomenon is not conclusively understood, as multiple interdependent parameters affect the OER activity simultaneously. Herein, a layered cobalt borophosphate precatalyst, Co(H2O)2[B2P2O8(OH)2]&#183;H2O, is fully reconstructed into two different CoCat phases. In contrast to previous reports, this reconstruction is not initiated at the surface but at the electrode substrate to catalyst interface. Ex situ and in situ investigations of the two borophosphate derived CoCats, as well as the prominent CoPi and CoBi identify differences in the Tafel slope/range, buffer binding and content, long&#8208;range order, number of accessible edge sites, redox activity, and morphology. Considering and interconnecting these aspects together with proton mass&#8208;transport limitations, a comprehensive picture is provided explaining the different OER activities. The most decisive factors are the buffers used for reconstruction, the number of edge sites that are not inhibited by irreversibly bonded buffers, and the morphology. With this acquired knowledge, an optimized OER system is realized operating in near&#8208;neutral potassium borate medium at 1.62&#160;&#177;&#160;0.03&#160;VRHE yielding 250&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 65&#160;&#176;C for 1&#160;month without degrading performance.

         <title>Zinc&#8208;Assisted Cobalt Ditelluride Polyhedra Inducing Lattice Strain to Endow Efficient Adsorption&#8208;Catalysis for High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>

Lattice strain generated by Zn&#8208;doped CoTe2 polyhedra balances the intrinsic catalytic effect and the adsorption of polysulfides, and the catalytic mechanism for accelerating polysulfide conversion is verified in combination with d&#8208;band center theory, Bader charge, and Gibbs free energy. It offers a guiding idea for the device of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Developing a conductive catalyst with high catalytic activity is considered to be an effective strategy for improving cathode kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, especially at large current density and with lean electrolytes. Lattice&#8208;strain engineering has been a strategy to tune the local structure of catalysts and to help understand the structure&#8211;activity relationship between strain and catalyst performance. Here, Co0.9Zn0.1Te2@NC is constructed after zinc atoms are uniformly doped into the CoTe2 lattice. The experimental/theoretical results indicate that a change of the coordination environment for the cobalt atom by the lattice strain modulates the d&#8208;band center with more electrons occupied in antibonding orbitals, thus balancing the adsorption of polysulfides and the intrinsic catalytic effect, thereby activating the intrinsic activity of the catalyst. Benefiting from the merits, with only 4 wt% dosages of catalyst in the cathode, an initial discharge capacity of 1030 mAh g&#8722;1 can be achieved at 1 C and stable cycling performances are achieved for 1500/2500 cycles at 1 C/2 C. Upon sulfur loading of 7.7&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, the areal capacity can reach 12.8 mAh cm&#8722;2. This work provides a guiding methodology for the design of catalytic materials and refinement of adsorption&#8208;catalysis strategies for the rational design of cathode in lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.

         <title>Guanidinium&#8208;Decorated Nanostructure for Precision Sonodynamic&#8208;Catalytic Therapy of MRSA&#8208;Infected Osteomyelitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable nanostructure is developed and assessed for outstanding biofilm disruption effect by capturing bacteria and penetrating biofilm matrix of guanidinium, and the synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic effect. The remotely controlled nanostructure efficiently clears infection and mediates the inflammation resolution in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus&#8208;infected osteomyelitis, thus providing a novel sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy for osteomyelitis.








Abstract
Osteomyelitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm infection is difficult to eradicate and can even be life&#8208;threatening. Given that the infection is persistent and deep&#8208;seated in the bone tissue, controlled and efficient treatment of osteomyelitis remains challenging. Herein, an activatable nanostructure (Au/TNT@PG) is presented for synergistic sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy of MRSA&#8208;infected osteomyelitis. The Au/TNT@PG backbone is obtained by conjugating a guanidinium&#8208;rich polymer (PG), a component that penetrates the biofilm matrix, onto ultrasound (US)&#8208;absorbing gold&#8208;doped titanate nanotubes (Au/TNTs). Under deep&#8208;penetrating US irradiation, the nanocomposite generates 1O2 for sonodynamic therapy and catalyzes the decomposition of endogenous H2O2 into toxic &#8226;OH in the acidic infection microenvironment for catalytic therapy, leading to bacterial cell death. Its robust antibacterial effectiveness is attributable to its bacteria&#8208;capturing ability, the biofilm penetrability of positively charged guanidinium, and the subsequent synergistic effect of sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic action of Au/TNT. Such a remotely controlled approach potentiates the polarization of macrophages to M2&#8208;type while suppressing the M1&#8208;type, leading to topical inflammation resolution and enhanced osteoblast proliferation and differentiation to inhibit bone loss. Therefore, this study provides a generic nanotherapeutic approach for efficient sonodynamic&#8208;catalytic therapy with respect to osteomyelitis.

         <title>Dense Local Triplet States and Steric Shielding of a Multi&#8208;Resonance TADF Emitter Enable High&#8208;Performance Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) emitter exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.132, 0.092), narrow full width at half maximum of 22&#160;nm, and high external quantum efficiency of 23.4% is developed by introducing bulky biphenyls and N&#8208;biphenyl&#8208;N&#8208;ortho&#8208;dimethylphenylamine that create dense local triplet states and suppress intramolecular aggregation. 








Abstract
Multi&#8208;resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) molecules based on boron and nitrogen atoms are emerging as next&#8208;generation blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) due to their narrow emission spectra and triplet harvesting properties. However, intermolecular aggregation stemming from the planar structure of typical MR&#8208;TADF molecules that leads to concentration quenching and broadened spectra limits the utilization of the full potential of MR&#8208;TADF emitters. Herein, a deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitter, pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me, is developed to suppress intermolecular interactions effectively. Furthermore, photophysical investigation and theoretical calculations reveal that adding biphenyl moieties to the core body creates dense local triplet states in the vicinity of S1 and T1 energetically, letting the emitter harvest excitons efficiently. OLEDs based on pBP&#8208;DABNA&#8208;Me show a high external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 23.4% and a pure&#8208;blue emission with a Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinate of (0.132, 0.092), which are maintained even at a high doping concentration of 100&#160;wt%. Furthermore, by incorporating a conventional TADF sensitizer, deep&#8208;blue OLEDs with a CIE value of (0.133, 0.109) and an extremely high EQE of 30.1% are realized. These findings provide insight into design strategies for developing efficient deep&#8208;blue MR&#8208;TADF emitters with fast triplet upconversion and suppressed self&#8208;aggregation.

         <title>Direct Observation of Self&#8208;Hybridized Exciton&#8208;Polaritons and Their Valley Polarizations in a Bare WS2 Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a bare WS2 layer is reported. The polariton emission is demonstrated to be controllable by varying the thickness of the sample or excitation power. It is also shown that the polariton inherits the valley degree of freedom from excitons and exhibits high valley polarization (Pv =&#160;0.18) at room temperature.








Abstract
The strong excitonic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have led to the successful demonstration of exciton&#8208;polaritons (EPs) in various optical cavity structures. Recently, self&#8208;hybridized EPs have been discovered in a bare TMD layer, but experimental investigation is still lacking because of their nonradiative nature. Herein, the direct observation of self&#8208;hybridized EPs in a bare multilayer WS2 via the evanescent field coupling technique is reported. Because of the thickness&#8208;dependent Rabi splitting energy, the dispersion curves of the EPs change sensitively with sample thickness. Moreover, continuous tuning of EP dispersion curves is demonstrated by controlling the excitation laser power. Lastly, it is observed that guided EPs retain valley polarization up to 0.2 at room temperature, representing a valley&#8208;preserved strong coupling regime. It is believed that the high tunability and valley polarization properties of the guided EPs in bare TMD layers can facilitate new nanophotonic and valleytronic applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Sustainable Defect&#8208;Passivation for Stable Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable dynamic passivation strategy by incorporating a photoisomeric molecule is put forward, which greatly enhances the photostability of perovskite photovoltaics. This dynamic strategy pays attention to and well matches the dynamics of defect generation during operation. The characteristics of the changeable molecular structure enable us to cope with defects updated in operation without introducing excess active sites.








Abstract
The generation of photoinduced defects and freely moving halogen ions is dynamically updated in real time. Accordingly, most reported strategies are static and short&#8208;term, which make their improvements in photostability very limited. Therefore, seeking new passivation strategies to match the dynamic characteristics of defect generation is very urgent. Without newly generated defects, a passivation molecule should exist in the configuration that would not become the initiation sites for defect generation. With newly generated defects, the passivation molecule should transfer into the other configuration that possesses the passivation sites. Herein, a classical photoisomeric molecule, spiropyran, is adopted, whose pre&#8208; and post&#8208;isomeric forms meet the requirements for two different configurations, to realize the state transition once the photoinduced defects appear during subsequent operation and dynamic capture for continuous renewal of defects. Consequently, spiropyrans work as light&#8208;triggered and self&#8208;healing sustainable passivation sites to realize continuous defect repair. The target devices retain 93% and 99% of their initial power conversion efficiencies after 456&#160;h aging under ultraviolet illumination and 1200&#160;h aging under full&#8208;spectrum illumination, respectively. This work provides a novel concept of sustainable passivation strategy to realize continuous defect&#8208;passivation and film&#8208;healing in perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Pd&#8211;Sb Rhombohedra with an Unconventional Rhombohedral Phase as a Trifunctional Electrocatalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra&#160;with exposed (003) facets are successfully prepared and applied as highly efficient trifunctional catalysts. The specific ordered arrangement of Pd and Sb atoms on the Pd20Sb7(003) facet not only lowers the oxygen binding energy to an optimal value for the oxygen reduction reaction, but also reduces CO binding for superior resistance to CO poisoning during the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering is an important strategy for designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts with optimized activity and stability. From the thermodynamic point of view, it remains a great challenge to synthesize unconventional phases of noble metals. Here, a new class of Pd&#8208;based nanostructure with unconventional rhombohedral Pd20Sb7 phase is successfully synthesized. Benefiting from the high proportion of the unique exposed Pd20Sb7 (003) surface, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra display much enhanced ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction performance compared with commercial Pd/C. Moreover, Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra are also demonstrated as an effective air cathode in non&#8208;aqueous Li&#8211;air batteries with an overpotential of only 0.24&#160;V. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unique exposed facets of Pd20Sb7 rhombohedra can not only reduce the excessive adsorption of CH3CO* to CH3COOH on Pd for promoting EOR process, but also weaken CO binding and CO poisoning. This work provides a new class of unconventional intermetallic nanomaterials with enhanced electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>A Water&#8208;Soluble AIEgen for Noninvasive Diagnosis of Kidney Fibrosis via SWIR Fluorescence and Photoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;assembly nanoprobe, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, showing aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) characteristics is elaborately designed and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression, specifically 1 week of modeling, via short&#8208;wave infrared fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The high renal clearance efficiency, outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive for renal fibrosis detection in preclinical settings.








Abstract
Early diagnosis of renal fibrosis is crucially significant on account of its worldwide prevalent tendency. Optical imaging in the near&#8208;infrared window has been recognized as an appealing technique for the timely detection of renal dysfunction. However, formulating a contrast agent that allows early monitoring of renal fibrosis and concurrently renally clearable in a normal group is still challenging. Herein, a nanosized fluorophore with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) features, namely AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs, is well&#8208;tailored and amenable to longitudinal visualization of the fibrosis progression specifically in the early&#8208;stage via short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR, 900&#8211;1700&#160;nm) fluorescence and photoacoustic bimodal imaging. The small size (&#8776;26&#160;nm), renally filtrable molecular weight (3.3&#160;kDa), high renal clearance efficiency (93.1 &#177; 1.7% excretion through the kidneys within 24&#160;h), outstanding imaging performance, and good biocompatibility, together make AIE&#8208;4PEG550 NPs remarkably impressive and far superior to clinical diagnostic assays. The finding in this study would provide a blueprint for the next generation of diagnostic agents for the extent of renal fibrosis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered, Implantable, and Wirelessly Controlled NO Generation System for Intracranial Neuroglioma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An integrated and self&#8208;powered NO generation system for intracranial glioma gas therapy is designed. The NO releasing device, which is intracranially&#160;implanted, can be driven by a wearable triboelectric nanogenerator, and the system is wirelessly operated by a smartphone to control NO release for efficient intracranial glioma therapy.








Abstract
Gas therapy is an emerging technology for improving cancer therapy with high efficiency and low side effects. However, due to the existence of the gatekeeper of the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB) and the limited availability of current drug delivery systems, there still have been no reports on gas therapy for intracranial neuroglioma. Herein, an integrated, self&#8208;powered, and wirelessly controlled gas&#8208;therapy system is reported, which is composed of a self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG) and an implantable nitric oxide (NO) releasing device for intracranial neuroglioma therapy. In the system, the patient self&#8208;driven TENG converts the mechanical energy of body movements into electricity as a sustainable and self&#8208;controlled power source. When delivering energy to light a&#160;light&#8208;emitting diode&#160;in the implantable NO releasing device via wireless control, the encapsulated NO donor s&#8208;nitrosoglutathione (GSNO) can generate NO gas to locally kill the glioma cells. The efficacy of the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept system in subcutaneous 4T1 breast cancer model in mice and intracranial glioblastoma multiforme in rats is verified. This self&#8208;powered gas&#8208;therapy system has great potential to be an effective adjuvant treatment modality to inhibit tumor growth, relapse, and invasion via teletherapy.

         <title>Shining Transparent Displays with Stable Narrow&#8208;Band Blue&#8208;Emitting Phosphor in Layered Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Transparent displays have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. In this work, the novel narrow&#8208;band blue&#8208;emitting NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design for transparent display. The fabricated prototype can render &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle and large color gamut.








Abstract
Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow&#8208;band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow&#8208;band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi3SiO4:Eu2+ phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transparent displays (TDs) rendering &#8220;levitating&#8221; images on screen have appeared as an emerging technology toward augmented/mixed reality applications. However, the traditional phosphor design and screen construction have severely limited the TD performance owing to the lack of efficient narrow-band blue emitters and stable screen structure. Herein, the novel narrow-band (full width at half maximum: 32&#160;nm) NaLi&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Eu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; phosphor with a peak at 467&#160;nm as a key blue emitter is explored, and it is sandwiched in layered film as a unique screen design. The devised screen features decent transparency, high emission color purity, and good reliability, and the TD prototype renders &#8220;floating&#8221; static images and vivid animation with broad viewing angle (15&#176;&#8211;165&#176;) and large color gamut (97% of National Television Standards Committee). Spectroscopic and microstructural characterizations reveal the TD superior performance originates from synergistic contributions of moderate crystal field effect (&#949;&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776; 1.13&#160;eV; &#949;&lt;sub&gt;cfs&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;&#8776; 1.60&#160;eV), weak vibronic coupling (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776; 3; &lt;i&gt;&#295;&#969;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776; 285 cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), and limited thermal ionization of 5d electrons (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;

A facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the fast synthesis of fully conjugated phthalocyanine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs). The as&#8208;prepared COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries with the achievement of a high reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;due to their good conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature.








Abstract
Fully aromatic conjugated covalent organic frameworks (FAC&#8208;COFs) with excellent physicochemical stability have been emerging as active semiconductors for diverse potential applications. Developing efficient synthesis methods for fabricating FAC&#8208;COFs will significantly facilitate the exploration over their material and photonic/electronic functionalities. Herein, a facile solvent&#8208;free strategy is developed for the synthesis of 2D phthalocyanine&#8208;based FAC&#8208;COFs (FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs). Cyclopolymerization of benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]bis[1,4]benzodioxin&#8208;2,3,9,10&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (BBTC) and quinoxalino[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:9,10]phenanthro[4,5&#8208;abc]phenazine&#8208;6,7,15,16&#8208;tetracarbonitrile (QPPTC) in ZnCl2&#160;leads to the fast formation and isolation of BB&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF and QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF, respectively. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and electron microscopy analysis reveal their crystalline nature with sql topology and AA stacking configuration. Thermogravimetric analysis and immersion experiment indicate their excellent stability. The conductivity test demonstrates their high conductivity of 0.93&#8211;1.94&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;owing to the fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated electronic structural nature. In particular, the as&#8208;prepared FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COFs show high&#8208;performance K+ storage in potassium&#8208;ion batteries due to their excellent conductivity, highly ordered and robust structure, and N/O&#8208;rich framework nature. Impressively, QPP&#8208;FAC&#8208;Pc&#8208;COF shows a large reversible capacity of 424&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;after 100&#160;cycles at 50&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and a capacity retention of nearly 100% at 2000&#160;mA&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;for over 10&#160;000&#160;cycles.

         <title>Donor End&#8208;Capped Alkyl Chain Length Dependent Non&#8208;Radiative Energy Loss in All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>

MPhS&#8208;C2 with shortened terminal alkyl chain, features thermal annealing (TA)&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condense packing, leading to suppressed upshifts of highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and efficient charge transport at small phase separation in BTP&#8208;eC9 blended devices, obtaining the highest PCE of 17.11% with &#916;Vnr of 0.192 V in ASM&#8208;OSCs.








Abstract
A critical bottleneck for further efficiency breakthroughs in organic solar cells (OSCs) is to minimize the non&#8208;radiative energy loss (e&#916;Vnr) while maximizing the charge generation. With the development of highly emissive low&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;fullerene acceptors, the design of high&#8208;performance donors becomes critical to enable the blend with the electroluminescence quantum efficiency to approach or surpass the pristine acceptor. Herein, by shortening the end&#8208;capped alkyl chains of the small&#8208;molecular donors from hexyl (MPhS&#8208;C6) to ethyl (MPhS&#8208;C2), the material obtained aggregation that was&#160;insensitive to thermal annealing (TA) along with&#160;condensed packing simultaneously. The former leads to small phase separation and suppressed upshifts of the highest occupied molecular orbital energy level during TA, and the latter facilitates its efficient charge&#8208;transport at aggregation&#8208;less packing. Hence, the &#916;Vnr decreases from 0.242 to 0.182&#160;V, from MPhS&#8208;C6 to MPhS&#8208;C2 based OSCs. An excellent PCE of 17.11% is obtained by 1,8&#8208;diiodoctane addition due to almost unchanged high Jsc (26.6&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and Voc (0.888&#160;V) with improved fill factor, which is the record efficiency with the smallest energy loss (0.497&#160;eV) and &#916;Vnr (0.192&#160;V) in all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule OSCs. These results emphasize the potential material design direction of obtaining concurrent TA&#8208;insensitive aggregation and condensed packing to maximize the device performances with a super low &#916;Vnr.

         <title>Dielectric Polymer with Designable Large Motion under Low Electric Field</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions is reported to be actuated under low electric fields (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1). The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This induces a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability.








Abstract
Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in&#8208;plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e&#8208;field)&#8208;induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in&#8208;plane actuation is converted into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e&#8208;field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e&#8208;field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&#8722;1) is reported. The material is a crystalline dynamic covalent network that can be reconfigured into arbitrary 3D geometries. This gives rise to a geometric effect that markedly amplifies the actuation, leading to designable large motions when the dielectric polymer is heated above its melting temperature to become a DE. Additionally, the crystallization transition enables dynamic multimodal motions and active deployability. These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.

&lt;p&gt;Dielectric elastomers (DEs) can demonstrate&#160;fast and large in-plane expansion/contraction due to electric field (e-field)-induced Maxwell stress. For robotic applications, it is often necessary that the in-plane actuation is converted into out-of-plane motions with mechanical frames. Despite their performance appeal, their high driving e-field (20&#8211;100&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) demands bulky power accessories and severely compromises their durability. Here, a dielectric polymer that can be programmed into diverse motions actuated under a low e-field (2&#8211;10&#160;V &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) is reported.

These attributes result in unique design versatility for soft robots.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomic Layer Deposition of Sb2Te3/GeTe Superlattice Film and Its Melt&#8208;Quenching&#8208;Free Phase&#8208;Transition Mechanism for Phase&#8208;Change Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ crystallized Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice film is grown by atomic layer deposition on the planar and sidewall memory cell, showing a significantly decreased reset current compared with the homogeneously mixed alloy. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress and effective electromigration of the Ge atoms induce a melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization mechanism.








Abstract
Atomic layer deposition (ALD) of Sb2Te3/GeTe superlattice (SL) film on planar and vertical sidewall areas containing TiN metal and SiO2 insulator is demonstrated. The peculiar chemical affinity of the ALD precursor to the substrate surface and the 2D nature of the Sb2Te3 enable the growth of an in situ crystallized SL film with a preferred orientation. The SL film shows a reduced reset current of &#8776;1/7 of the randomly oriented Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy. The reset switching is induced by the transition from the SL to the (111)&#8208;oriented face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (FCC) Ge2Sb2Te5 alloy and subsequent melt&#8208;quenching&#8208;free amorphization. The in&#8208;plane compressive stress, induced by the SL&#8208;to&#8208;FCC structural transition, enhances the electromigration of Ge along the [111] direction of FCC structure, which enables such a significant improvement. Set operation switches the amorphous to the (111)&#8208;oriented FCC structure.

         <title>Polymeric Single&#8208;Ion Conductors with Enhanced Side&#8208;Chain Motion for High&#8208;Performance Solid Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC) based on heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers high ionic conductivity with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number, leading to high&#8208;performance solid zinc batteries.








Abstract
Zn&#8208;based solid polymer electrolytes (SPEs) have enormous potential in realizing high&#8208;performance zinc&#8208;ion batteries. Polymeric single&#8208;ion conductor (PSIC)&#8208;based SPEs can largely eradicate anion migration and side reactions of electrodes with decreased polarization, but the ionic conductivity is still unsatisfactory due to the tight localized ion interactions and sluggish chain motion. Herein, by employing the heterocyclic tetrazole as the anionic center of the side chain, a novel PSIC is fabricated with optimized charge delocalization and enhanced side&#8208;chain motion. The as&#8208;prepared PSIC delivers an ionic conductivity up to 5.4 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 with an ultrahigh Zn2+ transference number of 0.94. Based on the PSIC, dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;free Zn plating/stripping cycling (2000&#160;h) is achieved. A further assembled Zn&#8214;V2O5 battery exhibits superior performances to other solid ZIBs, including a high discharge capacity, excellent rate capability, and long cycling life. In addition, a remarkable shelf&#8208;life (90 d), low self&#8208;discharge rate, and good temperature adaptability of the solid battery can be achieved benefiting from the high stability of the SPE during operation. The PSIC&#8208;based SPEs with advanced ion&#8208;transport structure endow solid ZIBs with significant performance improvement, high safety, and durability.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Boosted Imine Cathodes with Extended Conjugated Structure for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have been the spotlight in energy storage owing to their intrinsic safety, fast kinetics, and low cost. In this work, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated structure is in situ injected into layered Ti&#8208;based MXene (Ti3C2Tx) to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. The assembled ZIBs exhibit ultralong cycle stability and display impressive potential for electronic devices.








Abstract
Organic molecules have been considered promising energy&#8208;storage materials in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs), but are plagued by poor conductivity and structural instability because of the short&#8208;range conjugated structure and low molecular weight. Herein, an imine&#8208;based tris(aza)pentacene (TAP) with extended conjugated effects along the C&#63742;N backbones is proposed, which is in situ injected into layered MXene to form a TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode. Theoretical and electrochemical analyses reveal a selective H+/Zn2+ co&#8208;insertion/extraction mechanism in TAP, which is ascribed to the steric effect on the availability of active C&#63742;N sites. Moreover, Ti3C2Tx, as a conductive scaffold, favors fast Zn2+ diffusion to boost the electrode kinetics of TAP. Close electronic interactions between TAP and Ti3C2Tx preserve the structural integrity of TAP/Ti3C2Tx during the repeated charge/discharge. Accordingly, the TAP/Ti3C2Tx cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 303 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.04 A g&#8722;1 in aqueous ZIBs, which also realizes an ultralong lifetime over 10&#160;000 cycles with a capacity retention of 81.6%. Furthermore, flexible Zn||TAP/Ti3C2Tx batteries with a quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrate potential application in wearable electronic devices. This work offers pivotal guidance to create highly stable organic electrodes for advanced ZIBs.

         <title>An Electrochemical&#8208;Electret Coupled Organic Synapse with Single&#8208;Polarity Driven Reversible Facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;Depression Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An advanced organic synapse with single&#8208;polarity presynaptic voltage driven facilitation and depression is reported. The device is controlled by the coupling effect in a polyelectrolyte&#8208;electret bilayer. It produces synaptic facilitation by electrochemical doping and depression by electret&#8208;charging. As a result, the device outperforms conventional organic electrochemical synapses with simplified operations and sophisticated functionality.








Abstract
Neuromorphic engineering and artificial intelligence demands hardware elements that emulates synapse algorithms. During the last decade electrolyte&#8208;gated organic conjugated materials have been explored as a platform for artificial synapses for neuromorphic computing. Unlike biological synapses, in current devices the synaptic facilitation and depression are triggered by voltages with opposite polarity. To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical&#8208;electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation&#8208;to&#8208;depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold&#8208;controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude&#8208;dependent, dual&#8208;modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.

To enhance the reliability and simplify the operation of the synapse without lowering its sophisticated functionality, here, an electrochemical-electret coupled organic synapse (EECS) possessing a reversible facilitation-to-depression switch,&#160;is devised. Electret charging counterbalances channel conductance changes due to electrochemical doping, inducing depression without inverting the gate polarity. Overall, EECS functions as a threshold-controlled synaptic switch ruled by its amplitude-dependent, dual-modal operation, which can well emulate information storage and erase as in real synapses. By varying the energy level offset between the channel material and the electret, the EECS's transition threshold can be adjusted for specific applications, e.g., imparting additional light responsiveness to the device operation. The novel device architecture represents a major step forward in the development of artificial organic synapses with increased functional complexity and it opens new perspectives toward the fabrication of abiotic neural networks with higher reliability, efficiency, and endurance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biomineralized Two&#8208;Enzyme Nanoparticles Regulate Tumor Glycometabolism Inducing Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Robust Antitumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomineralized two&#8208;enzyme nanoparticles are constructed using GOx, Mn2+, and HA (GOx&#8208;Mn/HA). GOx&#8208;Mn/HA can target the tumor site and, self&#8208;amplifying, regulate the tumor glycometabolism to cause tumor cell pyroptosis and upregulate PD&#8208;L1 expression. GOx&#8208;Mn/HA is further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to treat tumors, which can effectively inhibit tumor growth, recurrence, and metastasis.








Abstract
Currently, immune checkpoint therapy combined with chemotherapy and radiotherapy is a useful strategy for improving immunotherapy's therapeutic efficacy. However, chemotherapy and radiotherapy cause serious side effects, so finding safe and effective methods to combine with immunotherapy is critical. In this work,&#160;regulating tumor glycometabolism is found to induce tumor cell pyroptosis and regulate the degree of expression of programmed death&#8208;ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1). Therefore, how to treat tumors by regulating tumor glycometabolism in combination with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy is investigated here. First, the biomineralization&#8208;like method is used to construct nanoparticles with two&#8208;enzymatic activity by hybridizing nanozymes and glucose oxidase (GOx). It has the ability to self&#8208;amplify regulation of the glycometabolism of tumor cells. It can also induce tumor cell pyroptosis and increase the expression of PD&#8208;L1 in tumor cells. To treat tumors, nanoparticles are further combined with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1, which substantially inhibits tumor development and significantly increases &#160;the survival time of mice. Combination therapy also has a significant immunological memory effect, successfully preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This is thought to be the first study that combines tumor glycometabolism with immunocheckpoint blocking in cancer therapy. This innovative, safe, low&#8208;toxic, and highly effective anti&#8208;tumor strategy can have good prospects in clinical applications.

         <title>In situ Observation of Structural Evolution and Phase Engineering of Amorphous Materials during Crystal Nucleation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation from the amorphous phase is probed at the atomic scale through in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy. Three distinct stages, including aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals, are observed. Unconventional crystal phases, e.g., fcc Ru, hcp Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo, are formed through nucleation from the corresponding amorphous C&#8208;doped metal nanosheets.








Abstract
The nucleation pathway determines the structures and thus properties of formed nanomaterials, which is governed by the free energy of the intermediate phase during nucleation. The amorphous structure, as one of the intermediate phases during nucleation, plays an important role in modulating the nucleation pathway. However, the process and mechanism of crystal nucleation from amorphous structures still need to be fully investigated. Here, in situ aberration&#8208;corrected high&#8208;angle annular dark&#8208;field scanning transmission electron microscopy (HAADF&#8208;STEM) is employed to conduct real&#8208;time imaging of the nucleation of ultrathin amorphous nanosheets (NSs). The results indicate that their nucleation contains three distinct stages, i.e., aggregation of atoms, crystallization to form lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals, and relaxation of the lattice&#8208;expanded nanocrystals to form final nanocrystals. In particular, the crystallization processes of various amorphous materials are investigated systematically to form corresponding nanocrystals with unconventional crystalline phases, including face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) Ru, hexagonal&#8208;close&#8208;packed (hcp) Rh, and a new intermetallic IrCo alloy. In situ electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS) analysis unveils that the doped carbon in the original amorphous NSs can migrate to the surface during the nucleation process, stabilizing the obtained unconventional crystal phases transformed from the amorphous structures, which is also proven by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

         <title>Making Highly Elastic and Tough Hydrogels from Doughs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of using preexisting polymer chains to fabricate hydrogels from doughs is reported. The dough is formed by mixing the polymers with water and photoinitiator. Kneading and annealing then homogenize the dough and entangle the polymers. The polymers are crosslinked and swollen in water to equilibrium. Such a hydrogel resolves the conflict between swell&#8208;resistance and toughness, while having near&#8208;perfect elasticity.








Abstract
A hydrogel is often fabricated from preexisting polymer chains by covalently crosslinking them into a polymer network. The crosslinks make the hydrogel swell&#8208;resistant but brittle. This conflict is resolved here by making a hydrogel from a dough. The dough is formed by mixing long polymer chains with a small amount of water and photoinitiator. The dough is then homogenized by kneading and annealing at elevated temperatures, during which the crowded polymer chains densely entangle. The polymer chains are then sparsely crosslinked into a polymer network under an ultraviolet lamp, and submerged in water to swell to equilibrium. The resulting hydrogel is both swell&#8208;resistant and tough. The hydrogel also has near&#8208;perfect elasticity, high strength, high fatigue resistance, and low friction. The method is demonstrated with two widely used polymers, poly(ethylene glycol) and cellulose. These hydrogels have never been made swell&#8208;resistant, elastic, and tough before. The method is generally applicable to synthetic and natural polymers, and is compatible with industrial processing technologies, opening doors to the development of sustainable, high&#8208;performance hydrogels.

         <title>Multifunctional 4D&#8208;Printed Sperm&#8208;Hybrid Microcarriers for Assisted Reproduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
4D&#8208;printed microcarriers are developed to perform various functions, including multiple sperm cargo&#8208;release, local sperm capacitation, and mediation of cumulus&#8211;oocyte complex removal by in situ enzymatic reactions.








Abstract
Remotely controllable microrobots are appealing for various biomedical in vivo applications. In particular, in recent years, our&#160;group has focused on developing sperm&#8208;microcarriers to assist sperm cells with motion deficiencies or low sperm count (two of the most prominent male infertility problems) to reach the oocyte toward in&#8208;vivo&#8208;assisted fertilization. Different sperm carriers, considering their motion in realistic media and confined environments, have been optimized. However, the already&#8208;reported sperm carriers have been mainly designed to transport single sperm cell, with limited functionality. Thus, to take a step forward, here, the development of a 4D&#8208;printed multifunctional microcarrier containing soft and smart materials is reported. These microcarriers can not only transport and deliver multiple motile sperm cells, but also release heparin and mediate local enzymatic reactions by hyaluronidase&#8208;loaded polymersomes (HYAL&#8208;Psomes). These multifunctional facets enable in situ sperm capacitation/hyperactivation, and the local degradation of the cumulus complex that surrounds the oocyte, both to facilitate the sperm&#8211;oocyte interaction for the ultimate goal of in vivo assisted fertilization.

A spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;decorated &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube arrays (NTAs) photoanode is developed for the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. The superiority of the co&#8208;edged FeO6 octahedral structure in the Formox process is demonstrated. Impressively, the heterostructure and the interfacial effect of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 and CoFe2O4 facilitates the separation and transport of photogenerated carriers, resulting in superior PEC methanol conversion efficiency and formaldehyde selectivity.








Abstract
The interaction mechanism between the reacting species and the active site of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3&#8208;based photoanodes in photoelectrochemical methanol conversion reaction is still ambiguous. Herein, a simple two&#8208;step strategy is demonstrated to fabricate a porous &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 heterojunction for the methanol conversion reaction. The influence of the electronic structure of active site and interfacial effect on the reaction are investigated by constructing two different FeO6 octahedral configurations and heterogeneous structures. The optimal sample ZnFeCo&#8208;2 affords high photocurrent density of 1.17 mA cm&#8722;2 at 0.5 V vs Ag/AgCl, which is 3.2 times than that of ZnFe (0.37 mA cm&#8722;2). Meanwhile, the ZnFeCo&#8208;2 also exhibits 97.8% Faraday efficiency of CH3OH to HCHO, and long&#8208;term stability over 40 h. Furthermore, density functional theory calculations reveal that the heterostructured &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/CoFe2O4 with favorable electron transfer effectively lowers methanol adsorption, C&#8211;H bond activation, and HCHO desorption energy relative to the pristine &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3, resulting in excellent methanol conversion efficiency.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable, Highly Efficient Organic Solar Cells Enabled by Polymer Donors Featuring Hydrogen&#8208;Bonding Spacers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient, intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs) are developed by designing a new series of polymer donors (PDs, PhAm) featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable flexible spacers. High power conversion efficiency (PCE = 12.7%) and stretchability (PCE retention of &gt; 80% at 32% strain) are demonstrated, which represent the best performances in terms of both PCE and stretchability among the IS&#8208;OSCs reported to date.








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), consisting of all stretchable layers, are attracting significant attention as a future power source for wearable electronics. However, most of the efficient active layers for OSCs are mechanically brittle due to their rigid molecular structures designed for high electrical and optical properties. Here, a series of new polymer donors (PDs, PhAmX) featuring phenyl amide (N1,N3&#8208;bis((5&#8208;bromothiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)methyl)isophthalamide, PhAm)&#8208;based flexible spacer (FS) inducing hydrogen&#8208;bonding (H&#8208;bonding) interactions is developed. These PDs enable IS&#8208;OSCs with a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 12.73% and excellent stretchability (PCE retention of &gt;80% of the initial value at 32% strain), representing the best performances among the reported IS&#8208;OSCs to date. The incorporation of PhAm&#8208;based FS enhances the molecular ordering of PDs as well as their interactions with a Y7 acceptor, enhancing the mechanical stretchability and electrical properties simultaneously. It is also found that in rigid OSCs, the PhAm5:Y7 blend achieves a much higher PCE of 17.5% compared to that of the reference PM6:Y7 blend. The impact of the PhAm&#8208;FS linker on the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of OSCs is thoroughly investigated.

Organic Solar Cells
In article number 2207544, Jung&#8208;Yong Lee, Bumjoon J. Kim, and co&#8208;workers report the development of efficient and intrinsically stretchable organic solar cells (IS&#8208;OSCs), by designing new polymer donors featuring hydrogen&#8208;bonding&#8208;capable spacers. The use of the new polymer donors significantly enhances the stretchability of the active layers, and the resulting IS&#8208;OSCs, maintain 86% of the initial efficiency after 100 cycles of stretching/releasing under 15% strain.

Methanol Oxidation Reaction
To investigate the mechanism of the  coedge/coplanar FeO6 structure for the methanol oxidation reaction (MOR), spinel&#8208;CoFe2O4&#8208;modified &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 nanotube array structures are designed by Zhao&#8208;Qing Liu and co&#8208;workers, as reported in article number 2208438. Benefiting from the special electronic structure of the coedge active FeO6 site and the interfacial effect of the heterojunction, the obtained CoFe2O4/&#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 demonstrates favorable performance for the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde.

         <title>Stabilization of Perovskite Solar Cells: Recent Developments and Future Perspectives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The roles of electrode materials and interfaces in perovskite solar cell (PSC) devices are discussed&#160;in terms of perovskite stability. The various factors responsible for rapid degradation in PSCs are provided. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials for carbon&#8208;based PSC as a substitute for noble metals are addressed, along with the recent progress.








Abstract
Exceptional power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 25.7% in perovskite solar cells (PSCs) has been achieved, which is comparable with their traditional rivals (Si&#8208;based solar cells). However, commercialization&#8208;worthy efficiency and long&#8208;term stability remain a challenge. In this regard, there are increasing studies focusing on the interface engineering in PSC devices to overcome their poor technical readiness. Herein, the roles of electrode materials and interfaces in PSCs are discussed in terms of their PCEs and perovskite stability. All the current knowledge on the factors responsible for the rapid intrinsic and external degradation of PSCs is presented. Then, the roles of carbonaceous materials as substitutes for noble metals are focused on, along with the recent research progress in carbon&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a sub&#8208;category of PSCs, that is, flexible PSCs, is considered as a type of exceptional power source due to their high power&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratios and figures of merit for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics. Last, the future perspectives and directions for research in PSCs are discussed, with an emphasis on their commercialization.

         <title>Understanding of Oxygen Redox in the Oxygen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 50, December 15, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive understanding of oxygen redox in lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM)&#8208;based electrocatalysts and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. Meanwhile, the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction on metal oxides is interpreted and perspectives on the future development of LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts are provided.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transfer process during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) often either proceeds solely via a metal redox chemistry (adsorbate evolution mechanism (AEM), with metal bands around the Fermi level) or an oxygen redox chemistry (lattice oxygen oxidation mechanism (LOM), with oxygen bands around the Fermi level). Unlike the AEM, the LOM involves oxygen redox chemistry instead of metal redox, which leads to the formation of a direct oxygen&#8211;oxygen (O&#63743;O) bond. As a result, such a process is able to bypass the rate&#8208;determining step, that is, O&#63743;O bonding, in AEM, which highlights the critical advantage of LOM as compared to the conventional AEM. Thus, it has been well reported that LOM&#8208;based catalysts are able to demonstrate higher OER activities as compared to AEM&#8208;based catalysts. Here, a comprehensive understanding of the oxygen redox in LOM and all documented and possible characterization techniques that can be used to identify the oxygen redox are reviewed. This review will interpret the origins of oxygen redox in the reported LOM&#8208;based electrocatalysts and the underlying science of LOM&#8208;induced surface reconstruction in transition metal oxides. Finally, perspectives on the future development of LOM electrocatalysts are also provided.

         <title>Holographically Activatable Nanoprobe via Glutathione/Albumin&#8208;Mediated Exponential Signal Amplification for High&#8208;Contrast Tumor Imaging</title>

Abstract
Glutathione&#8208;activatable probes hold great promise for in vivo cancer imaging, but are restricted by their dependence on non&#8208;selective intracellular glutathione (GSH) enrichment and uncontrollable background noise. Here, we show a holographically activatable nanoprobe caging manganese tetraoxide for tumor&#8208;selective contrast enhancement in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) through cooperative GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification in tumor and rapid elimination in normal tissues. Once targeting tumors, the endocytosed nanoprobe effectively senses the lysosomal microenvironment to undergo instantaneous decomposition into Mn2+ with threshold GSH concentration of &#8764; 0.12&#160;mM for brightening MRI signals, thus achieving high contrast tumor imaging and flexible monitoring of GSH&#8208;relevant cisplatin resistance during chemotherapy. Upon efficient up&#8208;regulation of extracellular GSH in tumor via exogenous injection, the relaxivity&#8208;silent interstitial nanoprobe remarkably evolves into Mn2+ that are further captured/retained and re&#8208;activated into ultrahigh&#8208;relaxivity&#8208;capable complex by stromal albumin at tumor, and simultaneously allows the renal clearance of off&#8208;targeted nanoprobe in the form of Mn2+ via lymphatic vessels for suppressing background noise to distinguish tiny liver metastasis. These findings demonstrate the concept of holographic tumor activation via both tumor GSH/albumin&#8208;mediated cascade signal amplification and simultaneous background suppression for precise tumor malignancy detection, surveillance and surgical guidance.

         <title>Realising highly efficient sonodynamic bactericidal capability through the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect using two&#8208;dimensional catalytic planar defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conferring catalytic defects in sonosensitizers is of paramount importance in reinforcing sonodynamic therapy. However, the formation of such zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) defects is governed by the Schottky defect principle. We herein design two&#8208;dimensional (2D) catalytic planar defects within Ti3C2 sheets to address this challenge. These specific planar slip dislocations with abundant Ti3+ species [Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+)] can yield surface&#8208;bound O due to the effective activation of O2, thus resulting in a substantial amount of 1O2 generation and the 99.72% &#177; 0.03% bactericidal capability subject to ultrasound (US) stimulation. We discover that the 2D catalytic planar defects can intervene electron transfer through the phonon drag effect &#8211; a coupling effect between surface electrons and US&#8208;triggered phonons &#8211; that simultaneously contributes to a dramatic decrease in O2 activation energy from 1.65 to 0.06&#160;eV. Our design has achieved a qualitative leap in which the US catalytic site has transformed from 0D to 2D. Moreover, we reveal that the electron origin, electron transfer, and visible O2 activation pathway triggered by US can be attributed to the phonon&#8211;electron coupling effect. After coated with neutrophil membrane (NM) proteins, the NM&#8208;Ti3C2&#8208;SD(Ti3+) sheets further demonstrate a 6&#8208;log10 reduction in methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus burden in the infected bony tissue.

         <title>Efficient Red Light Emitting Diodes Based on a Zero&#8208;dimensional Organic Antimony Halide Hybrid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) organic metal halide hybrids (OMHHs) have recently emerged as a new class of light emitting materials with exceptional color tunability. While near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies (PLQEs) have been routinely obtained for a large number of 0D OMHHs, it remains challenging to apply them as emitter for electrically driven light emitting diodes (LEDs), largely due to the low conductivity of wide band gap organic cations. Here we report the development of a new OMHH, triphenyl(9&#8208;phenyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;3&#8208;yl) phosphonium antimony bromide (TPPcarzSbBr4), as emitter for efficient LEDs, which consists of semiconducting organic cations (TPPcarz+) and light emitting antimony bromide anions (Sb2Br82&#8722;). By replacing one of the phenyl groups in a well&#8208;known tetraphenylphosphonium cation (TPP+) with an electroactive phenylcarbazole group, a semiconducting TPPcarz+ cation has been developed for the preparation of red emitting 0D TPPcarzSbBr4 single crystals with a high PLQE of 93.8%. With solution processed TPPcarzSbBr4 thin films (PLQE of 86.1%) as light emitting layer, red LEDs have been fabricated to exhibit an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 5.12%, a peak luminance of 5957&#160;cd m&#8722;2, and a current efficiency of 14.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, which are the best values reported to date for electroluminescence devices based on 0D OMHHs.

         <title>Efficient and Bright Deep&#8208;red Light&#8208;emitting Diodes Based on a Lateral 0D/3D perovskite Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bright and efficient deep&#8208;red light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) are important for applications in medical therapy and biological imaging due to the high penetration of deep&#8208;red photons into human tissues. Metal&#8208;halide perovskites have potential to achieve bright and efficient electroluminescence due to their favorable optoelectronic properties. However, efficient and bright perovskite&#8208;based deep&#8208;red LEDs have not been achieved yet, due to either Auger recombination in low&#8208;dimensional perovskites or trap&#8208;assisted nonradiative recombination in three&#8208;dimensional perovskites. Here, we demonstrate a lateral Cs4PbI6/FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3 (zero&#8208;dimensional/three&#8208;dimensional, 0D/3D) heterostructure, which can enable efficient deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs at very high brightness. The Cs4PbI6 can facilitate the growth of low&#8208;defect FAxCs1&#8208;xPbI3, and act as low&#8208;refractive&#8208;index grids, which can simultaneously reduce nonradiative recombination and enhance light extraction. Our device reaches a peak external quantum efficiency of 21.0% at a photon flux of 1.75&#160;&#215;&#160;1021 m&#8722;2 s&#8722;1, which is almost two orders of magnitude higher than that of reported high efficiency deep&#8208;red perovskite LEDs. Our LEDs are suitable for pulse oximeters, showing an error &lt;2% of blood oxygen saturation compared with commercial oximeters.

         <title>Intracellular Glucose&#8208;Depriving Polymer Micelles for Anti&#8208;Glycolytic Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A new anti&#8208;cancer strategy to exploit abnormal metabolism of cancer cells rather than to merely control the drug release or rearrange the tumor microenvironment is reported herein. An anti&#8208;glycolytic amphiphilic polymer, designed considering the unique metabolism of cancer cells (Warburg effect) and aimed at the regulation of glucose metabolism, is synthesized through chemical conjugation between glycol chitosan (GC) and phenylboronic acid (PBA). GC&#8208;PBA derivatives form stable micellar structures under physiological conditions and respond to changes in glucose concentration. Once the micelles accumulate at the tumor site, intracellular glucose capture occurs, and the resultant energy deprivation through the inhibition of aerobic glycolysis remarkably suppresses tumor growth without significant side effects in vivo. This strategy highlights the need to develop safe and effective cancer treatment without the use of conventional anti&#8208;cancer drugs.

         <title>Light&#8208;fueled Non&#8208;reciprocal Self&#8208;oscillators for Fluidic Transportation and Coupling</title>

Abstract
Light&#8208;fueled self&#8208;oscillators based on soft actuating materials have triggered novel designs for small&#8208;scale robotic constructs that self&#8208;sustain their motion at non&#8208;equilibrium states and possess bioinspired autonomy and adaptive functions. However, the motions of most self&#8208;oscillators are reciprocal, which hinders their use in sophisticated biomimetic functions such as fluidic transportation. Here, we report an optically powered soft material strip that can perform non&#8208;reciprocal, self&#8208;sustained oscillation under water. The actuator is made of planar&#8208;aligned liquid crystal elastomer responding to visible light. Two laser beams from orthogonal directions allow for piecewise control over the strip deformation, enabling two self&#8208;shadowing effects coupled in one single material to yield non&#8208;reciprocal strokes. The non&#8208;reciprocity, stroke pattern and handedness are connected to the fluidic pumping efficiency, which can be controlled by the excitation conditions. We demonstrate autonomous microfluidic pumping in clockwise and anticlockwise directions, translocation of a micro&#8208;object by liquid propulsion, and coupling between two oscillating strips through liquid medium interaction. The results can offer new concepts for non&#8208;equilibrium soft actuators that can perform bio&#8208;like functions under water.

         <title>Control of Molecular Orbital Ordering Using a van der Waals Monolayer Ferroelectric</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) ferroelectric materials provide a promising platform for the electrical control of quantum states. In particular, due to their 2D nature, they are suitable for influencing the quantum states of deposited molecules via the proximity effect. Here, we&#160;report electrically controllable molecular states in phthalocyanine molecules adsorbed on monolayer ferroelectric material SnTe. In particular, we&#160;demonstrate that the strain and ferroelectric order in SnTe creates a transition between two distinct orbital orders in the adsorbed phthalocyanine molecules. By controlling the polarization of the ferroelectric domain using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we&#160;have successfully demonstrated that orbital order can be manipulated electrically. Our&#160;results show how ferroelastic coupling in 2D systems allows control of molecular states, providing a starting point for ferroelectrically switchable molecular orbital ordering and ultimately, electrical control of molecular&#160;magnetism.

         <title>Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reaction in Acidic Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Water electrolysis is one of the most efficient and environmentally benign methods for the hydrogen production using renewable but intermittent power sources. The well&#8208;established proton exchange membrane (PEM)&#8208;based water electrolysis, which operates under acidic conditions, possesses many advantages compared to alkaline water electrolysis, such as compact design, higher voltage efficiency and higher gas purity. However, the PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis is hampered by the low efficiency, instability and high cost of anodic electrocatalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Many OER electrocatalysts are prone to dissolution and/or surface structure transformation under the oxidizing OER potentials in the harsh acidic environment, finally leading to a drastic decrease of catalytic performance. In this review, we comprehensively summarize, classify and discuss the recently reported acidic OER electrocatalysts. The related fundamental studies on OER mechanisms and the relationship between activity and stability are particularly highlighted in order to provide an atomistic&#8208;level understanding for the OER catalysis. A stability test protocol is suggested to evaluate the intrinsic activity degradation. We also discuss some current challenges and unresolved questions, such as the usage of carbon&#8208;based materials and the differences between the electrocatalyst performances in acidic electrolytes and PEM&#8208;based electrolyzer. Finally, the suggestions for the most promising electrocatalysts and a perspective for future research are outlined. This review presents a fresh impetus and guideline to the rational design and synthesis of high&#8208;performance acidic OER electrocatalysts for PEM&#8208;based water electrolysis.

         <title>Recent Research Progress of Organic Small&#8208;Molecule Semiconductors with High Electron Mobilities</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic electronics has made great progress in the past decades, which is inseparable from the innovative development of organic electronic devices and the diversity of organic semiconductor materials. It is worth mentioning that both of these great advances are inextricably linked to the development of organic high&#8208;performance semiconductor materials, especially the representative n&#8208;type organic small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high electron mobilities. The n&#8208;type organic small molecules have the advantages of simple synthesis process, strong intermolecular stacking, tunable molecular structure and easy to functionalized structures. Furthermore, the n&#8208;type semiconductor is a remarkable and important component for constructing complementary logic circuits and p&#8208;n heterojunction structures. Therefore, n&#8208;type organic semiconductors play an extremely important role in the field of organic electronic materials and are the basis for the industrialization of organic electronic functional devices. This review focuses on the modification strategies of organic small molecules with high electron mobility at molecular level, and discusses in detail the applications of n&#8208;type small&#8208;molecule semiconductor materials with high mobility in organic field&#8722;effect transistors (OFETs), organic light&#8208;emitting transistors, organic photodetectors, and gas sensors.

         <title>Three&#8208;Dimensional Reconstruction of Conductive Filaments in HfOx&#8208;Based Memristor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
HfOx&#8208;based memristor has been studied extensively as one of the most promising memories for the excellent nonvolatile data storage and computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory capabilities. However, the resistive switching mechanism, relying on the formation and rupture of conductive filaments (CFs) during device operations, is still under debate. In this work, the CFs with different morphologies after different operations&#8212;forming, set and reset&#8212;have been clearly revealed for the first time by three&#8208;dimensional (3D) reconstruction of conductive atomic force microscopy (c&#8208;AFM)images. Intriguingly, multiple CFs have been successfully observed in HfOx&#8208;based memristor devices with three different resistive states. CFs after forming, set, and reset exhibit the typical morphologies of hourglass, inverted&#8208;cone, and short&#8208;cone, respectively. The rupture location of CFs after the reset operation is also observed clearly. These findings reveal the microscopic behaviors underlying the resistive switching, which could pave the road to design and optimize oxide&#8208;based memristors for both memory and computing applications.

         <title>Emerging Halide Perovskite Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Halide perovskites have gained tremendous attention in the past decade owing to their excellent properties in optoelectronics. Recently, a fascinating property, ferroelectricity, has been discovered in halide perovskites and quickly attracted widespread interest. Compared with traditional perovskite oxide ferroelectrics, halide perovskites display natural advantages such as structural softness, low weight, and easy processing, which are highly desirable in applications pursuing miniaturization and flexibility. This review focuses on the current research progress in halide perovskite ferroelectrics, encompassing the emerging materials systems and their potential applications in ferroelectric photovoltaics, self&#8208;powered photodetection, and X&#8208;ray detection. We also attempt to point out the main challenges and possible solutions in the future development of halide perovskite ferroelectric materials.

         <title>Electron Lifetime of Over One Month in Disordered Organic Solid&#8208;state Films</title>

Abstract
Understanding intrinsic carrier lifetime in disordered organic solid&#8208;state semiconductors is essential for improving device performance in not only molecule&#8208;based optoelectronic devices such as organic solar cells (OSC) but also photocatalysts used for producing solar fuel cells. Carriers in disordered films are generally thought to have short lifetimes on a scale ranging from nanoseconds to milliseconds. These short carrier lifetimes cause loss of charges in OSCs and low quantum yields in photocatalysts and impede the future application of organic semiconductors to, for example, charge&#8208;storage&#8208;based memory devices. This study reports an ultra&#8208;long intrinsic carrier lifetime of more than one month in a disordered film of an organic semiconductor stored at room temperature without external power. This extraordinary lifetime, which is several orders of magnitude longer than that generally believed possible in conventional organic semiconductors, arises from carrier stabilization by spontaneous orientation polarization, excited spin&#8208;triplet recycling, and blocking of recombination processes in disordered films.

         <title>Thermally Crosslinked Hole Conductor Enables Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells with 23.9% Efficiency</title>

Abstract
Poly[bis(4&#8208;phenyl)(2,4,6&#8208;trimethylphenyl)amine] (PTAA) represents the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hole transport material (HTM) in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs), however, unsatisfied surface properties of PTAA as well as high energy disorder in the bulk film hinder the further enhancement of device performance. Herein, we strategically develop a simple small molecule 10&#8208;(4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)phenyl)&#8208;3,7&#8208;bis(4&#8208;vinylphenyl)&#8208;10H&#8208;phenoxazine (MCz&#8208;VPOZ) for in&#8208;situ crosslinking of polymer hole conductor (CL&#8208;MCz) via a facile and low&#8208;temperature cross&#8208;linking technology. The resulting polymer CL&#8208;MCz offers high energy ordering, improved electrical conductivity as well as appropriate energy&#8208;level alignment, enabling efficient charge carrier collection in the devices. Meanwhile, CL&#8208;MCz synchronously provides satisfied surface wettability and interfacial functionalization, facilitating the formation of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with fewer bulk iodine vacancies and suppressed carrier recombination. Significantly, the device with CL&#8208;MCz yields a champion power conversion efficiency of 23.9% along with an extremely low energy loss down to 0.41&#160;eV, which represents the highest reported efficiency for non&#8208;PTAA based polymer HTMs in inverted PSCs. Furthermore, the corresponding unencapsulated devices exhibited competitive shelf&#8208;life stability under various operational stressors up to 2500 hours, reflecting high promises of CL&#8208;MCz in the scalable PSC application. This work underscores the promising potential of the cross&#8208;linking approach in preparing low&#8208;cost, stable and efficient polymer HTMs toward reliable PSCs.

         <title>Strain engineering of Ni&#8208;rich cathode enables exceptional cyclability in pouch&#8208;type full cells</title>

Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are at the forefront of the development of high&#8208;energy Li&#8208;ion batteries, yet the extensive applications are retarded by the deteriorative capacity and thermal instability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ co&#8208;precipitation strategy is implemented to achieve the novel super&#8208;dispersed Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathode that consists of the elongated and radially&#8208;aligned primary particles with increased oxygen stable {001} planes. The unique microstructure homogenizes the intragranular and intergranular strain distribution and stabilizes the spherical secondary particles, effectively inhibiting microcrack formation and propagation and surface degradation. The super&#8208;dispersed Nb doping prevents the Li /Ni disordering and lattice oxygen escape, thereby further strengthening the crystal structure and thermal stability. Accordingly, this cathode delivers a high reversible capacity of 229.0 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1C with much better retention at 55 &#176;C and 5C after 100 cycles than the conventional Nb&#8208;doped Ni&#8208;rich cathodes. In a pouch&#8208;type full cell, it exhibits exceptional long life with a capacity retention of 91.9% at 1C after 500 cycles and 80.5% at 5C after 2000 cycles within 3.0&#8208;4.2&#160;V, greatly prolonging the service period to cater for the lightweight and intelligence of electric vehicles.

         <title>3D Cold&#8208;Trap Environment Printing for Long&#8208;Cycle Aqueous Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Zn powder (Zn&#8208;P)&#8208;based anodes are always regarded as ideal anode candidates for zinc ion battery owing to low&#8208;cost and ease of processing. However, the intrinsic negative properties of Zn&#8208;P&#8208;based anodes such as easy corrosion and uncontrolled dendrite growth have limited their further applications. Herein, a novel 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3DCEP) technology is proposed to achieve the MXene and Zn&#8208;P (3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P) anode with highly ordered arrangement. Benefitting from the unique inhibition mechanism of high lattice matching and physical confinement effects within 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode, it can effectively homogenize the Zn2+ flux and alleviate the Zn deposition rate of the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode during Zn plating/stripping. Consequently, 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P anode exhibits a superior cycling lifespan of 1,400&#160;h with high coulombic efficiency of &#8776; 99.2% in symmetric batteries. More encouragingly, paired with MXene and Co doped MnHCF cathode via 3D cold&#8208;trap environment printing (3 DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF), the 3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Zn&#8208;P//3DCEP&#8208;MXene/Co&#8208;MnHCF full battery delivers high cyclic durability with the capacity retention of 95.7% after 1,600 cycles. This study brings inspired universality pathway to rapidly fabricate reversible Zn anode with highly ordered arrangement in cold environment for micro&#8208;zinc storage systems.

         <title>Multimorphic Materials: Spatially Tailoring Mechanical Properties via Selective Initiation of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Access to multimaterial polymers with spatially localized properties and robust interfaces is anticipated to enable new capabilities in soft robotics, such as smooth actuation for advanced medical and manufacturing technologies. Here, orthogonal initiation is used to create interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs) with spatial control over morphology and mechanical properties. Base catalyzes the formation of a stiff and strong polyurethane, while blue LEDs initiate the formation of a soft and elastic polyacrylate. IPN morphology is controlled by when the LED is turned &#8220;on&#8221;, with large phase separation occurring for short time delays (&#8764;1&#8208;2 minutes) and a mixed morphology for longer time delays (&gt;5 minutes), which was supported by dynamic mechanical analysis, small angle X&#8208;ray scattering, and atomic force microscopy. Through tailoring morphology, tensile moduli and fracture toughness can be tuned across &#8764;1&#8208;2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, a simple spring model is used to explain the observed mechanical behavior. Photopatterning produces &#8220;multimorphic&#8221; materials, where morphology is spatially localized with fine precision (&lt;100&#160;&#956;m), while maintaining a uniform chemical composition throughout to mitigate interfacial failure. The fabrication of hinges represents a possible use&#8208;case for multimorphic materials in soft robotics.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Magnetically Powered Spiky Nanomachines with Thermal Control of Viscosity for Enhanced Cancer Mechanotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Nanomachines with active propulsion have emerged as an intelligent platform for targeted cancer therapy. Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, we proposed a photo&#8208;magnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermal&#8208;dependent viscosity tunability to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine was integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. The physical simulations and experimental results proved that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photo&#8208;magnetic coupling effect in the NIR&#8208;II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling&#8208;enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain&#8208;like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity were efficiently propelled under simultaneously&#8208;applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photo&#8208;magnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.

Achieving an efficient locomotion performance using an external energy conversion is a key requirement in the design of nanomachines. In this study, inspired by diverse spiky structures in nature, we proposed a photo-magnetically powered nanomachine (PMN) with a spiky surface and thermal-dependent viscosity tunability to facilitate mechanical motion in lysosomes for cancer mechanotherapy. The hybrid nanomachine was integrated with magnetic nanoparticles as the core and covered with gold nanotips. The physical simulations and experimental results proved that the spiky structure endows nanomachines with an obvious photo-magnetic coupling effect in the NIR-II region through the alignment and orienting movement of plasmons on the gold tips. Using a coupling-enhanced magnetic field, PMNs are efficiently assembled into chain-like structures to further elevate energy conversion efficiency. Notably, PMNs with the thermal control of viscosity were efficiently propelled under simultaneously-applied dual external energy sources in cell lysosomes. Enhanced mechanical destruction of cancer cells via PMNs was confirmed both in vitro and in vivo under photo-magnetic treatment. This study provides a new direction for designing integrated nanomachines with active adaptability to physiological environments for cancer treatment.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Direct CO2 capture by alkali&#8208;dissolved cellulose and sequestration in building materials and artificial reef structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Current carbon capture and utilization (CCU) technologies require high energy input and costly catalysts. Here, we offer an effective pathway that addresses climate action by atmospheric CO2 sequestration. Industrially relevant highly reactive alkali cellulose solutions are used as CO2 absorption media. The latter lead to mineralized cellulose materials (MCM) at a tailorable cellulose&#8208;to&#8208;mineral ratio, forming organic&#8208;inorganic viscous systems (viscosity from 102 to 107 mPa s and storage modulus from 10 to 105 Pa). CO2 absorption and conversion into calcium carbonate and associated minerals translate to maximum absorption of 6.5 gCO2 gcellulose&#8722;1, tracking inversely with cellulose loading. Cellulose lean gels are easily converted into dry powders, shown as a functional component of ceramic glazes and cementitious composites. Meanwhile, cellulose&#8208;rich gels are moldable and extrudable, yielding stone&#8208;like structures tested as artificial substrates for coral reef restoration. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) suggests new CCU opportunities for building materials, as demonstrated in underwater deployment for coral reef ecosystem restoration.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Photodetectors with Over 450 Days Stability Enabled by Synergistic Engineering for Pulse Oximetry System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;bandgap tin (Sn)&#8208;lead (Pb) halide perovskites can achieve near&#8208;infrared response for photodetectors. However, the Sn&#8208;based devices suffer from notorious instability and high defect densities due to the oxidation propensity of Sn2+. Herein, we present a multifunctional additive 4&#8208;amino&#8208;2,3,5,6&#8208;tetrafluorobenzoic acid (ATFBA), which can passivate surface defects and inhibit the oxidation of Sn2+ through hydrogen bonds and chelation coordination from the terminal amino and carboxyl groups. The perfluorinated benzene ring structure of ATFBA affords the passivator assembled at the grain boundaries to enhance the water resistance. With the synergistical passivation of these functional groups, our Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetector exhibits a remarkable responsivity of 0.52 A W&#8722;1 and an excellent specific detectivity of 5.34 &#215; 1012 Jones at 850&#160;nm, along with remaining 97% of its initial responsivity over 450 days. Benefitting from high sensitivity, the photodetector was integrated into a pulse oximetry sensor visualization system, yielding accurate blood oxygen saturation and heart rate with less than 2% error. Our work paves the avenue towards constructing high&#8208;performance and stable Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite photodetectors for practical applications.

         <title>Magnetic Skyrmion Transistor gated with Voltage&#8208;Controlled Magnetic Anisotropy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The paradigm shift of information carriers from charge to spin has long been awaited in modern electronics. The invention of the spin&#8208;information transistor is expected to be an essential building block for the future development of spintronics. Here, we introduce a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept experiment of a magnetic skyrmion transistor working at room temperature, which has never been demonstrated experimentally. With the spatially uniform control of magnetic anisotropy, we can maintain the shape and topology of a skyrmion when passing the controlled area. Our findings will open a new route towards the design and realization of skyrmion&#8208;based spintronic devices in the near future.

         <title>Molecular Electronics: Creating and Bridging Molecular Junctions and Promoting Its Commercialization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Molecular electronics is driven by the dream of expanding Moore's law to the molecular level for next&#8208;generation electronics through incorporating individual or ensemble molecules into electronic circuits. For nearly 50 years, numerous efforts have been made to explore the intrinsic properties of molecules and develop diverse fascinating molecular electronic devices with desired functionalities. The flourishing of molecular electronics is inseparable from the development of various elegant methodologies for creating nanogap electrodes and bridging the nanogap with molecules. This review first focuses on the techniques for making lateral and vertical nanogap electrodes by breaking, narrowing and fixed modes, and highlights their capabilities, applications, merits, and shortcomings. After summarizing the approaches of growing single molecules or molecular layers on the electrodes, we comprehensively group the methods of constructing a complete molecular circuit into three categories: (1) directly bridging one molecule&#8208;electrode component with another electrode, (2) physically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components, and (3) chemically bridging two molecule&#8208;electrode components. Finally, we discuss the current state of molecular circuit integration and commercialization and provide our perspectives, hoping to encourage the community to accelerate the realization of fully scalable molecular electronics for a new era of integrated microsystems and applications.

         <title>Direct Conversion of Liquid Organic Precursor into 3D Laser&#8208;induced Graphene Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Among the different states of matter, liquids have particular advantages in terms of easy handling and recycling as the precursors, which has been manifested in various chemosynthetic reactions, but remains underexplored in graphene synthesis. This work reports the direct conversion of liquid organic precursor into versatile 3D graphene materials using rapid laser irradiation under ambient conditions. The liquid precursor allowed easy fabrication of graphene with significant 3D architectures, including powders, patterned composite structures, and substrate&#8208;free films. Taking advantages of the high compatibility of liquid precursor with a wide range of dopants, the 3D graphene could be further engineered together with various functional components, especially the high loading (&#8764;15 wt%) and well&#8208;dispersed (an average diameter of less than 50&#160;nm) high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoparticles. Furthermore, combined with the 3D printing strategy, the rapid construction of graphene with complex and accurate 3D shapes was demonstrated via a selective in&#8208;situ laser transforming (SLT) strategy. With the highly structural integrity unachievable by traditional 3D printing methods, the obtained objects showed an electrical conductivity of 4380 S/m and a compressive modulus of 31.8&#160;MPa. The results reported in this work will open up a new way for the fabrication of functional carbon materials with customizable shapes and components

         <title>Modulations in Superconductors: Probes of Underlying Physics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The importance of modulations has been elevated to an unprecedented level, due to the delicate conditions required to bring out exotic phenomena in quantum materials, such as topological materials, magnetic materials, and superconductors. Recently, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art modulation techniques in material science, such as electric double&#8208;layer transistor, piezoelectric&#8208;based strain apparatus, angle twisting, and nanofabrication, are utilized in superconductors. They not only efficiently increase the tuning capability to the broader ranges, but also extend the tuning dimensionality to unprecedented degrees of freedom, including quantum fluctuations of competing phases, electronic correlation, and phase coherence essential to global superconductivity. Here, for a comprehensive review, these techniques together with the established modulation methods, such as elemental substitution, annealing, and polarization&#8208;induced gating, are contextualized. Depending on the mechanism of each method, the modulations are categorized into stoichiometric manipulation, electrostatic gating, mechanical modulation, and geometrical design. Their recent advances are highlighted by applications in newly discovered superconductors, e.g., nickelates, Kagome metals, and magic&#8208;angle graphene. Overall, the review is to provide systematic modulations in emergent superconductors and serve as the coordinate for future investigations, which will stimulate researchers in superconductivity and other fields to perform various modulations towards a thorough understanding of quantum materials.

         <title>In&#8208;situ Absorption Characterization Guided Slot&#8208;Die&#8208;Coated High&#8208;Performance Large&#8208;area Flexible Organic Solar Cells and Modules</title>

Abstract
Slot&#8208;die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll (R2R) processing of large&#8208;area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large&#8208;area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx&#8208;1 and Qx&#8208;2, show quite different film&#8208;formation kinetics in the slot&#8208;die coating process. The in&#8208;situ absorption spectrum study indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx&#8208;2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx&#8208;1 based 1 cm2 flexible device exhibits an excellent PCE of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot&#8208;die coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx&#8208;2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%. Moreover, the 30 cm2 modules based on PM6:Qx&#8208;1, containing six 5 cm2 sub&#8208;cells, exhibit a PCE of 12.20%. After being stored in a glove box for over 6000&#160;h, the PCE remains at 103% of its initial values, indicating excellent shelf stability. Therefore, these results show a promising future strategy for the upscaling fabrication of flexible large&#8208;area OSCs.

&lt;p&gt;Slot-die coating is recognized as the most compatible method for the roll-to-roll (R2R) processing of large-area flexible organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the photovoltaic performance of large-area flexible OSC lags significantly behind that of traditional spin coating devices. In this work, two acceptors, Qx-1 and Qx-2, show quite different film-formation kinetics in the slot-die coating process. The &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; absorption spectrum study indicates that the excessive crystallinity of Qx-2 provides early phase separation and early aggregation, resulting in oversized crystal domains. Consequently, the PM6:Qx-1 based 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; flexible device exhibits an excellent PCE of 13.70%, which is the best performance among the slot-die coated flexible devices; in contrast, the PM6:Qx-2 blend shows a pretty poor efficiency, which is lower than 1%.

         <title>HACS: Helical Auxetic Yarn Capacitive Strain Sensors with Sensitivity Beyond the Theoretical Limit</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The development of flexible strain sensors over the past decade has focused on accessing high strain percentages and high sensitivity (i.e. gauge factors). Strain sensors that employ capacitance as the electrical signal to correlate to strain are typically restricted in sensitivity because of the Poisson effect. By employing auxetic structures, the limits of sensitivity for capacitive sensors have been exceeded, which improves the competitiveness of this modality of sensing. We&#160;present the first employment of helical auxetic yarns as capacitive sensors. We&#160;found that the helical auxetic yarn capacitive sensors (which we&#160;term HACS) response was&#160;dependent on the two main fabrication variables&#8211;ratio of diameters and helical wrapping length. Depending on these variables, we&#160;could obtain sensors that responded to strain with increasing or decreasing capacitance values. We&#160;found a greater auxetic character resulted in larger sensitivities accessible at smaller strains&#8211;a characteristic that is not commonly found when accessing high gauge factors. In addition, we&#160;obtained the highest sensitivity for auxetic capacitive sensors reported thus far. We&#160;propose a mechanism of sensor response that explains both the variable capacitance response and the high gauge factors obtained experimentally.

         <title>Understanding Self&#8208;assembly of Silica Precipitating Peptides to Control Silica Particle Morphology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The most advanced materials are those found in nature. These evolutionary optimized substances provide highest efficiencies, e.g., in harvesting solar energy or providing extreme stability, and are intrinsically biocompatible. However, the mimicry of biological materials is limited to a few successful applications since we still lack the tools to recreate natural materials. Herein, we provide such means based on a peptide library derived from the silaffin protein R5 that enables rational biomimetic materials design. It is now evident that biomaterials do not form via mechanisms observed in&#8208;vitro. Instead, the material's function and morphology are predetermined by precursors that self&#8208;assemble in solution, often from a combination of protein and salts. These assemblies act as templates for biomaterials. The RRIL peptides used here are a small part of the silica precipitation machinery in diatoms. By connecting RRIL motifs via varying central bi&#8208; or trifunctional residues, we generated a library of stereoisomers, which allowed us to characterize different template structures in the presence of phosphate ions by combining residue&#8208;resolved real&#8208;time nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Understanding these templates in atomistic detail, we were able to control the morphology of silica particles via manipulation of the template precursors.

         <title>Attenuating Metabolic Competition of Tumor Cells for Favoring the Nutritional Demand of Immune Cells by a Branched Polymeric Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tumor cells are dominant in the nutritional competition in the tumor microenvironment (TME), and their metabolic abnormalities often lead to microenvironmental acidosis and nutrient deprivation, thereby impairing the function of immune cells and diminishing the anti&#8208;tumor therapeutic effect. Herein, we report a branched polymeric conjugate and its efficacy in attenuating the metabolic competition of tumor cells. Compared with the control nanoparticles prepared from its linear counterpart, the branched conjugate&#8208;based nanoparticles (branched NPs) could more efficiently accumulate in the tumor tissue and interfere with the metabolic processes of tumor cells to increase the concentration of essential nutrients and reduce the level of immunosuppressive metabolites in the TME, thus creating a favorable environment for infiltrated immune cells. Its combined treatment with an immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) achieved an enhanced anti&#8208;tumor effect. Our work presents a promising approach for targeting the metabolic competition in the TME to enhance the chemo&#8208;immunotherapeutic effect against cancers.

         <title>Gold Nanobipyramid&#8208;Mediated Apoptotic Camouflage of Adipocytes for Obesity Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Obesity treatment is a global public health challenge due to the inadequate weight loss and weight regain even after endeavors with multimodal treatments. Considering abundant resident macrophages in adipose tissues, precise regulation of the interactions between macrophages and adipocytes may provide chances for immunotherapy of obesity. Herein, inspired by the phagocytosis of macrophages to clear apoptotic cells in homeostasis, an immunotherapy strategy for obesity treatment was proposed for the first time through apoptotic camouflage of adipocytes by PAAu BPs to activate macrophages for clearance, where PAAu BPs were gold nanobipyramids engineered with adipose&#8208;targeting and apoptotic cell&#8208;mimicking functions. During the clearance, macrophage was switched from pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 to anti&#8208;inflammatory M2, remarkably modulating the immune microenvironment of adipose tissues to prevent weight regain. After inguinal injection with PAAu BPs, the body weights of obesity mice were effectively decreased by 24.4%, and could be decreased by 33.3% when combined with photothermal lipolysis, and little weight regain was associated with treatments. This study demonstrates the strategy of camouflaging adipocytes with apoptotic feature holds great potential for obesity immunotherapy.

         <title>Assembly of Fillable Microrobotic Systems by Microfluidic Loading with Dip Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Microrobots can provide spatiotemporally well&#8208;controlled cargo delivery that can improve therapeutic efficiency compared to conventional drug delivery strategies. Robust microfabrication methods to expand the variety of materials or cargoes that can be incorporated into microrobots could greatly broaden the scope of their functions. However, current surface coating or direct blending techniques used for cargo loading result in inefficient loading and poor cargo protection during transportation, which leads to cargo waste, degradation, and non&#8208;specific release. Herein, we present a versatile platform to fabricate fillable microrobots using Microfluidic Loading and Dip Sealing (MLDS). MLDS enables the encapsulation of different types of cargoes within hollow microrobots and protection of cargo integrity. The technique is supported by high&#8208;resolution 3D printing with an integrated microfluidic loading system, which realises a highly precise loading process and improves cargo loading capacity. A corresponding dip sealing strategy was developed to encase and protect the loaded cargo whilst maintaining the geometric and structural integrity of the loaded microrobots. This dip sealing technique is suitable for different materials, including thermal and light responsive materials. The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.

The MLDS platform provides new opportunities for microrobotic systems in targeted drug delivery, environmental sensing, and chemically powered micromotor applications.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Portable Nanowire Array Gas Sensor for Dynamic NO2 monitoring at room temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) has driven an increasing consumer demand of self&#8208;powered gas sensors for real&#8208;time data collection and autonomous responses in industries such as environmental monitoring, workplace safety, smart cities, and personal healthcare. Despite intensive research and rapid progress in the field, most reported self&#8208;powered devices, specifically NO2 sensors for air pollution monitoring, have limited sensitivity, selectivity, and scalability. Here, a novel photovoltaic self&#8208;powered NO2 sensor is demonstrated based on axial p&#8208;i&#8208;n homojunction InP nanowire (NW) arrays, that overcome these limitations. The optimized innovative InP NW array device was designed by numerical simulation for insights into sensing mechanisms and performance enhancement. Without a power source, this InP NW sensor achieves an 84% sensing response to 1&#160;ppm NO2 and records a limit of detection down to the sub&#8208;ppb level, with little dependence on the incident light intensity, even under &lt;5% of 1 sun illumination. Based on this great environmental fidelity, the sensor was integrated onto a commercial microchip interface to evaluate its performance in the context of dynamic environmental monitoring of motor vehicle exhaust. Our results show that compound semiconductor nanowires can form promising self&#8208;powered sensing platforms suitable for future mega&#8208;scale IoT systems.

         <title>Interface Capture Effect Printing Atomic&#8208;Thick 2D Semiconductor Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to print arrays of atomic&#8208;thick semiconducting thin films is demonstrated, which enables printed devices with micrometer&#8208;scale resolution, high density, and attractive performance, thus paving the way for practical large&#8208;area application of 2D crystals in electronic devices at an affordable cost.








Abstract
2D semiconductor crystals offer the opportunity to further extend Moore's law to the atomic scale. For practical and low&#8208;cost electronic applications, directly printing devices on substrates is advantageous compared to conventional microfabrication techniques that utilize expensive photolithography, etching, and vacuum&#8208;metallization processes. However, the currently printed 2D transistors are plagued by unsatisfactory electrical performance, thick semiconductor layers, and low device density. Herein, a facile and scalable 2D semiconductor printing strategy is demonstrated utilizing the interface capture effect and hyperdispersed 2D nanosheet ink to fabricate high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;thick semiconductor thin&#8208;film arrays without additional surfactants. Printed robust thin&#8208;film transistors using 2D semiconductors (e.g., MoS2) and 2D conductive electrodes (e.g., graphene) exhibit high electrical performance, including a carrier mobility of up to 6.7 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of 2&#160;&#215;&#160;106 at 25&#160;&#176;C. As a proof of concept, 2D transistors are printed with a density of &#8776;47&#160;000 devices per square centimeter. In addition, this method can be applied to many other 2D materials, such as NbSe2, Bi2Se3, and black phosphorus, for printing diverse high&#8208;quality thin films. Thus, the strategy of printable 2D thin&#8208;film transistors provides a scalable pathway for the facile manufacturing of high&#8208;performance electronics at an affordable cost.

         <title>Locally Concentrated Ionic Liquid Electrolyte with Partially Solvating Diluent for Lithium/Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte employing partially solvating monofluorobenzene as the diluent is developed for Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries. Benefiting from the stable interphases simultaneously formed on both the anode and cathode, dendrite&#8208;free cycling of lithium&#8208;metal anodes with high Coulombic efficiency and highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells with low lithium&#8208;metal excess have been achieved.








Abstract
The development of Li/sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries requires electrolytes that can form stable electrolyte/electrode interphases simultaneously on lithium&#8208;metal anodes (LMAs) and SPAN cathodes. Herein, a low&#8208;flammability locally concentrated ionic liquid electrolyte (LCILE) employing monofluorobenzene (mFBn) as the diluent is proposed for Li/SPAN cells. Unlike non&#8208;solvating diluents in other LCILEs, mFBn partially solvates Li+, decreasing the coordination between Li+ and bis(fluorosulfonyl)imide (FSI&#8722;). In turn, this triggers a more substantial decomposition of FSI&#8722; and consequently results in the formation of a solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) rich in inorganic compounds, which enables a remarkable Coulombic efficiency (99.72%) of LMAs. Meanwhile, a protective cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI), derived mainly from FSI&#8722; and organic cations, is generated on the SPAN cathodes, preventing the dissolution of polysulfides. Benefiting from the robust interphases simultaneously formed on both the electrodes, a highly stable cycling of Li/SPAN cells for 250 cycles with a capacity retention of 71% is achieved employing the LCILE and only 80% lithium&#8208;metal excess.

         <title>Anharmonic Cation&#8211;Anion Coupling Dynamics Assisted Lithium&#8208;Ion Diffusion in Sulfide Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By comparing the anharmonic phonon coupling calculations with the ab initio molecular dynamics calculations, this study unveils a unique phenomenon in sulfide solid electrolytes in comparison with halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes.








Abstract
Sulfide&#8208;based lithium superionic conductors often show higher Li&#8208;ion conductivity than other types of electrolyte materials. This work unveils a unique Li&#8208;ion conductive behavior in these materials through the perspective of anharmonic coupling assisted Li&#8208;ion diffusion. Li hopping events can happen simultaneously with various types of lattice dynamics, while only a statistically important synchronization of motions may indicate coupling. This method enables a direct evaluation of the coupling strength between these motions, which more fundamentally decides if a specific type of lattice motion is really anharmonically coupled to the Li hopping event and whether the coupling can facilitate the Li diffusion. By a new ab initio computational approach, this work unveils a unique phenomenon in prototype sulfide electrolytes in comparison with typical halide ones, that Li&#8208;ion conduction can be boosted by the anharmonic coupling of low&#8208;frequency Li phonon modes with high&#8208;frequency anion stretching or flexing phonon modes, rather than the low&#8208;frequency rotational modes. The coupling pushes Li ions toward the diffusion channels for reduced diffusion barriers. The result from the lower temperature range (&#8776;0&#8211;300 K) of simulation can also be more relevant to the application of solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Zwitterionic Dendrimersomes: A Closer Xenobiotic Mimic of Cell Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of a phosphocholine&#8208;based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self&#8208;assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.








Abstract
Building functional mimics of cell membranes is an important task toward the development of synthetic cells. So far, lipid and amphiphilic block copolymers are the most widely used amphiphiles with the bilayers by the former lacking stability while membranes by the latter are typically characterized by very slow dynamics. Herein, a new type of Janus dendrimer containing a zwitterionic phosphocholine hydrophilic headgroup (JDPC) and a 3,5&#8208;substituted dihydrobenzoate&#8208;based hydrophobic dendron is introduced. JDPC self&#8208;assembles in water into zwitterionic dendrimersomes (z&#8208;DSs) that faithfully recapitulate the cell membrane in thickness, flexibility, and fluidity, while being resilient to harsh conditions and displaying faster pore closing dynamics in the event of membrane rupture. This enables the fabrication of hybrid DSs with components of natural membranes, including pore&#8208;forming peptides, structure&#8208;directing lipids, and glycans to create raft&#8208;like domains or onion vesicles. Moreover, z&#8208;DSs can be used to create active synthetic cells with life&#8208;like features that mimic vesicle fusion and motility as well as environmental sensing. Despite their fully synthetic nature, z&#8208;DSs are minimal cell mimics that can integrate and interact with living matter with the programmability to imitate life&#8208;like features and beyond.

&lt;p&gt;The synthesis of a phosphocholine-based Janus dendrimer is reported, which lacks the &#8220;weak points&#8221; that result in the chemical and physical instability of natural liposomes. Despite their synthetic nature, the resulting self-assembled dendrimersomes recapitulate the most important physical properties of cell membranes. This enables functionalization with natural functional molecules as well as mimicry of cellular functions on a basic level.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Information&#8208;Storage Expansion Enabled by a Resilient Aggregation&#8208;Induced&#8208;Emission&#8208;Active Nanocomposite Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite&#160;hydrogel is developed. The AIE luminogen can multiply protonate to interact with the clay through the electrostatic interaction in the gel network under acid stimulation, which causes fluorescence enhancement and a blueshift of the hydrogel. Synergistically taking advantage of this behavior and the high resilience of the hydrogel, information&#8208;storage expansion, and dual&#8208;encryption are realized.








Abstract
Advanced materials with high performance and distinctive function are one of the main driving forces for the development of human society. The selection of appropriate materials and adequately utilizing their features to apply them in a specific area rationally are of great significance but remain challenging. Herein, an aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE)&#8208;active nanocomposite (NC) hydrogel is developed by introducing a pH&#8208;responsive AIE luminogen (AIEgen) into a Laponite XLS/polyacrylamide&#8208;based NC hydrogel (Laponite is a trademark of the company BYK Additives Ltd.). The AIEgen can protonate to interact with the negatively charged clay through the electrostatic interaction, which results in a drastic fluorescence enhancement due to the restriction of intramolecular motion by the rigid clay to the protonated AIEgen. This behavior facilitates the input of fluorescent information with a high contrast ratio in the hydrogel by acid stimulation. Moreover, by utilizing the excellent resilience of the hydrogel, hierarchically inputting and displaying the information in the original and stretched states of the hydrogel film is realized, which achieves information&#8208;storage expansion and dual&#8208;encryption via switching between stretching and restoring the film. This work showcases fully and synergistically utilizing the superiorities of various advanced materials to achieve superior applications and should guide the future development of advanced materials in emerging areas.

         <title>Design of Smart Aggregates: Toward Rapid Clinical Diagnosis of Hyperlipidemia in Human Blood</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. They can act as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221; and autonomously respond to HLP to realize in vitro detection and in vivo imaging in mice and human blood. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm).








Abstract
Molecular aggregates with environmental responsive properties are desired for their wide practical applications such as bioprobes. Here, a series of smart near&#8208;infrared (NIR) luminogens for hyperlipidemia (HLP) diagnosis is reported. The aggregates of these molecules exhibit a twisted intramolecular charge&#8208;transfer effect in aqueous media, but aggregation&#8208;induced emission in highly viscous media due to the restriction of the intramolecular motion. These aggregates, which can autonomously respond to different environments via switching the aggregation state without changing their chemical structures are described, as &#8220;smart aggregates&#8221;. Intriguingly, these luminogens demonstrate NIR&#8208;II and NIR&#8208;III luminescence with ultralarge Stokes shifts (&gt;950&#160;nm). Both in vitro detection and in vivo imaging of HLP can be realized in a mouse model. Linear relationships exist between the emission intensity and multiple pathological parameters in blood samples of HLP patients. Thus, the design of smart aggregate facilitates rapid and accurate detection of HLP and provides a promising attempt in aggregate science.

         <title>Dopant&#8208;Free Bithiophene&#8208;Imide&#8208;Based Polymeric Hole&#8208;Transporting Materials for Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A dopant&#8208;free polymeric hole&#8208;transport material (HTM)&#160;PFBTI is successfully developed for PVSCs. The suitable energy levels, high hole mobility, and excellent surface passivation effects endow PFBTI&#8208;based organic/inorganic hybrid PVSCs with a promising PCE of 23.1% and much&#8208;enhanced stability. PFBTI can be further used in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells and achieve high PCEs.








Abstract
The development of hole&#8208;transport materials (HTMs) with high mobility, long&#8208;term stability, and comprehensive passivation is significant for simultaneously improving the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells (PVSCs). Herein, two donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) conjugated polymers PBTI and PFBTI with alternating benzodithiophene (BDT) and bithiophene imide (BTI) units are successfully developed with desirable hole mobilities due to the good planarity and extended conjugation of molecular backbone. Both copolymers can be employed as HTMs with suitable energy levels and efficient defect passivation. Shortening the alkyl chain of the BTI unit and introducing fluorine atoms on the BDT moiety effectively enhances hole mobility and hydrophobicity of the HTMs, leading to improved efficiency and stability of PVSCs. As a result, the organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid PVSCs with PFBTI as the HTM deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.1% with enhanced long&#8208;term operational and ambient stability, which is one of the best efficiencies reported for PVSCs with dopant&#8208;free polymeric HTMs to date. Moreover, PFBTI can be applied in inorganic PVSCs and perovskite/organic tandem solar cells, achieving a high PCE of 17.4% and 22.2%, respectively. These results illustrate the great potential of PFBTI as an efficient and widely applicable HTM for cost&#8208;effective and stable PVSCs.

         <title>Photoswitchable Microgels for Dynamic Macrophage Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light is demonstrated. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light stimulates in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that increases RGD availability, thereby facilitating macrophage adhesion linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization. Visible light induces the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels that decreases RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization.








Abstract
Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self&#8208;assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non&#8208;physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)&#8208;bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels occurs via cis&#8208;azobenzene formation mediated by near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible&#8208;light&#8208;absorbing upconversion&#8208;nanoparticle&#8208;coated materials. Real&#8208;time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels via visible&#8208;light&#8208;mediated trans&#8208;azobenzene formation. Near&#8208;infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin&#8208;4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro&#8208;regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD&#8208;bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro&#8208;inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non&#8208;toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.

&lt;p&gt;Dynamic manipulation of supramolecular self-assembled structures is achieved irreversibly or under non-physiological conditions, thereby limiting their biomedical, environmental, and catalysis applicability. In this study, microgels composed of azobenzene derivatives stacked via &#960;&#8211;cation and &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions are developed that are electrostatically stabilized with Arg&#8211;Gly&#8211;Asp (RGD)-bearing anionic polymers. Lateral swelling of RGD-bearing microgels occurs via &lt;i&gt;cis&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene formation mediated by near-infrared-light-upconverted ultraviolet light, which disrupts intermolecular interactions on the visible-light-absorbing upconversion-nanoparticle-coated materials. Real-time imaging and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate the deswelling of RGD-bearing microgels via visible-light-mediated &lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt;-azobenzene formation. Near-infrared light can induce in situ swelling of RGD-bearing microgels to increase RGD availability and trigger release of loaded interleukin-4, which facilitates the adhesion structure assembly linked with pro-regenerative polarization of host macrophages. In contrast, visible light can induce deswelling of RGD-bearing microgels to decrease RGD availability that suppresses macrophage adhesion that yields pro-inflammatory polarization. These microgels exhibit high stability and non-toxicity. Versatile use of ligands and protein delivery can offer cytocompatible and photoswitchable manipulability of diverse host cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Stable Sodium&#8208;Metal Batteries in Carbonate Electrolytes Achieved by Bifunctional, Sustainable Separators with Tailored Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This novel, mechanically flexible and bifunctional separator integrates the merits of serving as a highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributor to self&#8208;regulate/orientate the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecular level and physically suppresses Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structural level. Remarkably, Na symmetric cells achieve unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities in additive&#8208;free carbonate&#8208;based electrolytes.








Abstract
Sodium (Na) is the most appealing alternative to lithium as an anode material for cost&#8208;effective, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density energy&#8208;storage systems by virtue of its high theoretical capacity and abundance as a resource. However, the uncontrolled growth of Na dendrites and the limited cell cycle life impede the large&#8208;scale practical implementation of Na&#8208;metal batteries (SMBs) in commonly used and low&#8208;cost carbonate electrolytes. Herein, the employment of a novel bifunctional electrospun nanofibrous separator comprising well&#8208;ordered, uniaxially aligned arrays, and abundant sodiophilic functional groups is presented for SMBs. By tailoring the alignment degree, this unique separator integrates with the merits of serving as highly aligned ion&#8208;redistributors to self&#8208;orientate/homogenize the flux of Na&#8208;ions from a chemical molecule level and physically suppressing Na dendrite puncture at a mechanical structure level. Remarkably, unprecedented long&#8208;term cycling performances at high current densities (&#8805;1000&#160;h at 1 and 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, &#8805;700&#160;h at 5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) of symmetric cells are achieved in additive&#8208;free carbonate electrolytes. Moreover, the corresponding sodium&#8211;organic battery demonstrates a high energy density and prolonged cyclability over 1000 cycles. This work opens up a new and facile avenue for the development of stable, low&#8208;cost, and safe&#8208;credible SMBs, which could be readily extended to other alkali&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Large Exchange Coupling Between Localized Spins and Topological Bands in MnBi2Te4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic topological materials rely on strong interaction between localized spins and states comprising the topological bands. This interaction is directly interrogated in an intrinsic magnetic topological material, MnBi2Te4, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. It is found that this exchange coupling is &gt;100 times stronger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of &gt;25 meV.








Abstract
Magnetism in topological materials creates phases exhibiting quantized transport phenomena with potential technological applications. The emergence of such phases relies on strong interaction between localized spins and the topological bands, and the consequent formation of an exchange gap. However, this remains experimentally unquantified in intrinsic magnetic topological materials. Here, this interaction is quantified in MnBi2Te4, a topological insulator with intrinsic antiferromagnetism. This is achieved by optically exciting Bi&#8208;Te p states comprising the bulk topological bands and interrogating the consequent Mn 3d spin dynamics, using a multimodal ultrafast approach. Ultrafast electron scattering and magneto&#8208;optic measurements show that the p states demagnetize via electron&#8208;phonon scattering at picosecond timescales. Despite being energetically decoupled from the optical excitation, the Mn 3d spins, probed by resonant X&#8208;ray scattering, are observed to disorder concurrently with the p spins. Together with atomistic simulations, this reveals that the exchange coupling between localized spins and the topological bands is at least 100 times larger than the superexchange interaction, implying an optimal exchange gap of at least 25 meV in the surface states. By quantifying this exchange coupling, this study validates the materials&#8208;by&#8208;design strategy of utilizing localized magnetic order to manipulate topological phases, spanning static to ultrafast timescales.

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Zn&#8211;Air Batteries&#160;with Long Lifetime Enabled by Reconstructed Amorphous Multi&#8208;Metallic Sulfide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air battery&#160;works well at high current densities of 100&#8211;400&#8201;mA&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and low voltages due to the OER intermediate O* migration from the Ni to the Fe site in a defect&#8208;rich ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide derived by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, helping to break the restriction of the scaling relationship and then resulting in high intrinsic OER activity with a theoretical overpotential of 170&#8201;mV.








Abstract
Developing fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries is crucial for widening their application but remains challenging owing to the limitation of sluggish oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics and insufficient active sites of electrocatalysts. To solve this issue, a reconstructed amorphous FeCoNiSx electrocatalyst with high density of efficient active sites, yielding low OER overpotentials of 202, 255, and 323&#160;mV at 10, 100, and 500&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, respectively, is developed for fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries with low charging voltages at 100&#8211;400&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the fabricated 3241.8&#160;mAh (20&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, 25&#160;&#176;C) quasi&#8208;solid Zn&#8211;air battery shows long lifetime of 500&#160;h at &#8722;10 and 25&#160;&#176;C as well as 150&#160;h at 40&#160;&#176;C under charging 100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The detailed characterizations combine with density functional theory calculations indicate that the defect&#8208;rich crystalline/amorphous ternary metal (oxy)hydroxide forms by the reconstruction of amorphous multi&#8208;metallic sulfide, where the electron coupling effect among multi&#8208;active sites and migration of intermediate O* from Ni site to the Fe site breaks the scaling relationship to lead to a low theoretical OER overpotential of 170&#160;mV, accounting for the outstanding fast&#8208;charging property. This work not only provides insights into designing advanced OER catalysts by the self&#8208;reconstruction of the pre&#8208;catalyst but also pioneers a pathway for practical fast&#8208;charging Zn&#8211;air batteries.

         <title>Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Molecule&#8208;based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground&#8208;breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game&#8208;changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.








Abstract
Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources.

     alt="Quantum Advantage in a Molecular Spintronic Engine that Harvests Thermal Fluctuation Energy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Molecule-based engines with a quantum advantage are implemented using spin electronics to harvest the most basic form of energy: ambient heat. This ground-breaking interdisciplinary approach enables electrical output above room temperature using nanoscale electrical devices. This opens quantum technologies and spintronics toward disruptive energy applications, as a possible technological game-changer to help mitigate the energy/climate crises.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recent theory and experiments have showcased how to harness quantum mechanics to assemble heat/information engines with efficiencies that surpass the classical Carnot limit. So far, this has required atomic engines that are driven by cumbersome external electromagnetic sources. Here, using molecular spintronics, an implementation that is both electronic and autonomous is proposed. The spintronic quantum engine heuristically deploys several known quantum assets by having a chain of spin qubits formed by the paramagnetic Co center of phthalocyanine (Pc) molecules electronically interact with electron-spin-selecting Fe/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interfaces. Density functional calculations reveal that transport fluctuations across the interface can stabilize spin coherence on the Co paramagnetic centers, which host spin flip processes. Across vertical molecular nanodevices, enduring dc current generation, output power above room temperature, two quantum thermodynamical signatures of the engine's processes, and a record 89% spin polarization of current across the Fe/C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; interface are measured. It is crucially this electron spin selection that forces, through demonic feedback and control, charge current to flow against the built-in potential barrier. Further research into spintronic quantum engines, insight into the quantum information processes within spintronic technologies, and retooling the spintronic-based information technology chain, can help accelerate the transition to clean energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Macroscopic Heterostructure Membrane of Graphene Oxide/Porous Graphene/Graphene Oxide for Selective Separation of Deuterium Water from Natural Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene oxide/porous graphene/graphene oxide (GO/PG/GO) membrane separation technology by pressure&#8208;driven filtration is reported and it is applied in isotope separation at room temperature. It shows&#160;an excellent structural, long&#8208;term stability, ultralow energy consumption, and ultrahigh selectivity for deuterium water, including rejection rate of &#8776;97%, the selectivity of &#8776;35.2 as well.








Abstract
Deuterium water (D2O) is a strategic material that is widely used in and scientific research and has applications in fields such as nuclear energy generation. However, its content in natural water is extremely low. Therefore, the development of a room&#8208;temperature technology for achieving simple, efficient, and low&#8208;cost separation of D2O from natural water is challenging. In this study, porous graphene (PG) nanosheets with &#8220;crater&#8208;like&#8221; pores are sandwiched between two layers of graphene oxide (GO) membranes to prepare a GO/PG/GO membrane with a macroscopic heterostructure, which can be used to separate D2O and H2O by pressure&#8208;driven filtration. At 25&#160;&#176;C, the rejection rate of D2O is &#8776;97%, the selectivity of H2O/D2O is &#8776;35.2, and the excellent performance can be attributed to the difference of transmembrane resistance and flow state of H2O and D2O in the confinement state. In addition, the D2O concentration in natural water is successfully enriched from 0.013% to 0.059% using only one stage, and the membrane exhibits excellent structural and cycling stability. Therefore, this method does not require ultralow temperatures, high energy supplies, complex separation equipment, or the introduction of toxic chemicals. Thus, it can be directly applied to the large&#8208;scale industrial production and removal of D2O.

         <title>Overcoming the Outcoupling Limit of Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with Artificially Formed Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Textured perovskite films are formed artificially by controlling the dwell time of the antisolvent. Due to scattering at the textured surface, photons trapped in the waveguide mode can be extracted. Therefore, the external quantum efficiency is boosted significantly from 10% for flat perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to 20.5% for textured PeLEDs with an extraordinarily thick perovskite layer of 1.5&#160;&#181;m.








Abstract
The external quantum efficiency (EQE) of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art planar&#8208;structure perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is mainly limited by the outcoupling efficiency, which is around 20% and decreases significantly with the perovskite thickness. Here, an approach to artificially form textured perovskite films to boost the outcoupling limit of the PeLEDs is reported. By manipulating the dwell time of antisolvents, the perovskite phase precipitation mechanism, film&#8208;forming process, and surface texture can be finely controlled. The film surface roughness can be tuned from 15.3 to 241 nm, with haze increasing accordingly from 6% to &gt;90% for films with an average thickness of 1.5 &#181;m. The light outcoupling limit increases accordingly from 11.7% for the flat PeLEDs to 26.5% for the textured PeLEDs due to photon scattering at the interface. Consequently, the EQE is boosted significantly from around 10% to 20.5% with an extraordinarily thick emissive layer of 1.5 &#181;m. This study provides a novel way of forming light&#8208;extraction nanostructures for perovskite optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Triarylboron&#8208;Doped Acenethiophenes as Organic Sonosensitizers for Highly Efficient Sonodynamic Therapy with Low Phototoxicity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity.

Abstract
The development of efficient organic sonosensitizers is crucial for sonodynamic therapy (SDT) in the field of cancer treatment. Herein, a new strategy for the development of efficient organic sonosensitizers based on triarylboron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented. The attachment of boron to the linear acenethiophenes lowers the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy, resulting in redshifted absorptions and emissions. After encapsulation with the amphiphilic polymer DSPE&#8208;mPEG2000, it is found that the nanostructured BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs (nanoparticles of BAnTh&#160;and BTeTh) shows efficient hydroxyl radical (&#8226;OH) generation under ultrasound (US) irradiation in aqueous solution with almost no phototoxicity, which can overcome the shortcomings of O2&#8208;dependent SDT and avoid the potential cutaneous phototoxicity issue. In vitro and in vivo therapeutic results validate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes as sonosensitizers enable high SDT efficiency with low phototoxicity and good biocompatibility, indicating that boron&#8208;functionalization of acenes is a promising strategy toward organic sonosensitizers for SDT.

         <title>Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low&#8208;Temperature Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ is modified by 2&#8208;propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn2+. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast&#8208;charging and long&#8208;term cycling capability of Zn&#8208;ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries are well regarded among a next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2&#8208;propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn2+ by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V2O5 pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.

     alt="Regulation of Outer Solvation Shell Toward Superior Low-Temperature Aqueous Zinc-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outer solvation shell structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is modified by 2-propanol to form a eutectic solvation shell, which can promote the oriented deposition of Zn metal and great desolvation kinetics of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Attributed to its new outer solvation structure design, fast-charging and long-term cycling capability of Zn-ion batteries under extreme temperature operation condition are achieved.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aqueous Zn-ion batteries are well regarded among a next-generation energy-storage technology due to their low cost and high safety. However, the unstable stripping/plating process leading to severe dendrite growth under high current density and low temperature impede their practical application. Herein, it is demonstrated that the addition of 2-propanol can regulate the outer solvation shell structure of Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; by replacing water molecules to establish a &#8220;eutectic solvation shell&#8221;, which provides strong affinity with the Zn (101) crystalline plane and fast desolvation kinetics during the plating process, rendering homogeneous Zn deposition without dendrite formation. As a result, the Zn anode exhibits promising cycle stability over 500&#160;h under an elevated current density of 15&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and high depth of discharge of 51.2%. Furthermore, remarkable electrochemical performance is achieved in a 150&#160;mAh Zn|V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; pouch cell over 1000 cycles at low temperature of &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. This work not only offers a new strategy to achieve excellent performance of aqueous Zn-ion batteries under harsh conditions, but also reveals electrolyte structure designs that can be applied in related energy storage and conversion fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Spontaneous Interface Healing by a Dynamic Liquid&#8208;Crystal Transition for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;crystal (LC) molecules interacting with PbI2 retard the crystallization of the perovskite film, and finally increase the grain size. During annealing, the LC molecules undergo a phase transition, and then the flowable LC is extracted by the lower interface to release the residual stress, and accelerate electron extraction. A new engineering of additive phase transition is thus conceived.








Abstract
Low&#8208;temperature solution processing of thin&#8208;film semiconductors is more cost&#8208;effective than traditional vacuum processing; however, it leads to more defects during fast bulk crystallization and residual tensile stress. Herein, a new strategy of dynamic liquid&#8208;crystal transition (DLCT) is developed to solve these problems in one step. The design principle is used to suggest that the DLCT molecule should firstly interact with the perovskite grains in the bulk and meanwhile go through a dynamic transition to spontaneously heal the interface. A thermotropic LC molecule (CBO6SS6OCB) is then designed to demonstrate the strategy. The LC interacting with perovskite colloid forms an intermediate adduct to retard the crystallization. The annealing processes stimulate the concentrated LC solid, causing it to flow to the electron transport layer to release the residual stress to attain improved electron extraction. Consequently, the device efficiency is increased to 24.38%, where its VOC of 1.184&#160;V is among the best for the formamidine&#8208;based perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the ambient stability (93.0% of initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of aging) and light stability (96.3% of initial efficiency after 500&#160;h of aging) are much improved. This work conceives a new engineering of additive phase transition for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Vertical Growth of 2D Covalent Organic Framework Nanoplatelets on a Macroporous Scaffold for High&#8208;Performance Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A carbon electrode with tailor&#8208;made hierarchical pores spanning from nanometer to millimeter scale is fabricated by in&#160;situ growth vertically aligned covalent organic framework nanoplatelets on graphene aerogel. This electrode exhibits an integration of high energy density and high power density as well as good cyclic stability in flexible supercapacitor devices.








Abstract
Hierarchically structural engineering of electrodes is critical to achieving high energy density and high power density in electrochemical energy storage (EES). However, rational regulation of the mesoscopic structure that coordinates microscopic and macroscopic structural features simultaneously remains a significant challenge. Here, the construction of electrodes with well&#8208;defined hierarchical pores spanning multiple length scales from 1&#160;nm to 50&#160;&#181;m is reported. Vertically aligned 2D covalent organic framework (COF) nanoplatelets with a thickness around 30&#160;nm are in&#160;situ grown on macroporous graphene aerogel scaffold by a reversible polycondensation&#8208;termination strategy. The obtained electrode thus combines abundant accessible active sites and efficient transport expressways for both ions and electrons. When used for supercapacitors, a superior gravimetric capacitance of 289&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;as well as outstanding capacitance retention at both high charge/discharge rates of 77% from 0.5&#160;to 50&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;and high mass loading of 74% from 1.2&#160;to 10.4&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2&#160;are achieved. Hierarchical engineering of mesostructured 2D COF units on the macroporous scaffold will bring unprecedented structural designability and performance enhancement for EES electrodes.

         <title>Simultaneously Stabilizing Both Electrodes and Electrolytes by a Self&#8208;Separating Organometallics Interface for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries at Wide Temperatures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the aid of electrochemical evolution of an organometallic compound, a self&#8208;separating interface layer for Zn anodes is designed, which can promote the electrode and electrolyte stability simultaneously. The interface with a polymeric C4N3 skeleton and cations homogenizes the Zn2+ flux, induces planar deposition, and maintain cathode stability, leading to high&#8208;performance zinc batteries.








Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries are of great potential as one of the next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;storage devices due to their low cost and high safety. However, the development of long&#8208;term stable electrodes and electrolytes still suffers from great challenges. Herein, a self&#8208;separation strategy is developed for an interface layer design to optimize both electrodes and electrolytes simultaneously. Specifically, the coating with an organometallics (sodium tricyanomethanide) evolves into an electrically responsive shield layer composed of nitrogen, carbon&#8208;enriched polymer network, and sodium ions, which not only modulates the zinc&#8208;ion migration pathways to inhibit interface side reactions but also adsorbs onto Zn perturbations to induce planar zinc deposition. Additionally, the separated ions from the coating can diffuse to the electrolyte to affect the Zn2+ solvation structure and maintain the cathode structural stability by forming a stable cathode&#8211;electrolyte interface and sodium ions&#8217; equilibrium, confirmed by in situ spectroscopy and electrochemical analysis. Due to these unique advantages, the symmetric zinc batteries exhibit an extralong cycling lifespan of 3000&#160;h and rate performance at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at wide temperatures. The efficiency of the self&#8208;separation strategy is further demonstrated in practical full batteries with an ultralong lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles from &#8722;35 to 60 &#176;C.

         <title>Self&#8208;Propelled Nanomotors with an Alloyed Engine for Emergency Rescue of Traumatic Brain Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed to construct superactive engines for self&#8208;propulsion of nanomotors under physiological concentration of H2O2. The PtPdMo ternary alloy induced by plasma improves the catalytic activity of the Pt&#8208;based engine, thus promoting movement both in vitro and in vivo and simultaneously achieves nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy in traumatic&#8208;brain&#8208;injury mice.








Abstract
In severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI), acute oxidative stress and inflammatory cascades rapidly spread to cause irreversible brain damage and low survival rate within minutes. Therefore, developing a feasible solution for the quick&#8208;treatment of life&#8208;threatening emergency is urgently demanded to earn time for hospital treatment. Herein, Janus catalysis&#8208;driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma&#8208;induced alloying technology and sputtering&#8208;caused half&#8208;coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom&#8208;doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt&#8208;based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst&#8208;mediated cascade&#8208;blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor&#8208;based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first&#8208;aid scenarios due to their self&#8208;propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.

Herein, Janus catalysis-driven nanomotors (JCNs) are carefully constructed via plasma-induced alloying technology and sputtering-caused half-coating strategy. The theoretical calculation and experiment results indicate that the heteroatom-doping alloyed engine endows JCNs with much higher catalytic activity for removing reactive oxygen species and reactive nitrogen species than common Pt-based engines. When JCNs are dropped to the surface of the ruptured skull, they can effectively catalyze endogenous hydrogen peroxide, which induces movement as fuels to promote JCNs to deep brain lesions for further nanocatalyst-mediated cascade-blocking therapy. The results demonstrate that the JCNs successfully block the inflammatory cascades, thereby reversing multiple behavioral defects and dramatically declining the mortality of sTBI mice. This work provides a revolutionary nanomotor-based strategy to sense brain injury and scavenge oxidative stress. Meanwhile, the JCNs provide a feasible strategy to adapt various first-aid scenarios due to their self-propelled movement combined with highly multienzyme-like catalytic activity, exhibiting tremendous therapeutic potential to help people for emergency pretreatment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Visualized Gallium/Lyticase&#8208;Integrated Antifungal Strategy for Fungal Keratitis Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biocompatible gallium&#8208;based antifungal strategy (MLPGa), integrating lyticase and Ga ions, is&#160;developed for effective fungal keratitis treatment, which can degrade the permeation barrier of exopolysaccharides, then eradicate Candida albicans and biofilms through the mechanisms of extracellular polysaccharide degradation, intrinsic reactive oxygen production, and metabolic interference under Raman/PA bimodal imaging monitors.








Abstract
Fungal keratitis has been one of the common corneal infections that causes blindness, but an effective antifungal strategy remains a challenge. The exopolysaccharides both in the fungal cell walls and biofilms are a key that acts as a permeation barrier to weaken the therapeutic effect of antifungal agents. Herein, lyticase and gallium ions co&#8208;integrated nanosystems (MLPGa) are presented that can degrade exopolysaccharides and then effectively eradicate both planktonic Candida albicans and mature biofilms. The potential antifungal mechanism involves reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and metabolic interference of antioxidant&#8208;related genes, exopolysaccharide&#8208;related genes, iron&#8208;ion&#8208;utilization&#8208;related genes, fungal/biofilm&#8208;development&#8208;related genes, and virulence genes. Meanwhile, the Raman signals generated by the chelation between the nanosystems and the gallium ions provide a real&#8208;time visualization tool to monitor Ga release. Finally, the MLPGa&#8208;based antifungal strategy with good biocompatibility achieves a satisfactory therapeutic effect in a fungal keratitis mouse model. This study provides a unique approach to the effective treatment of fungal keratitis in clinical practice.

         <title>Solution&#8208;Processed Ternary Tin (II) Alloy as Hole&#8208;Transport Layer of Sn&#8211;Pb Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Efficiency and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A solution&#8208;processed SnOCl ternary tin (II) alloy as hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) for Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells is reported, which results in efficiencies of 23.2% and 26.3% for Sn&#8211;Pb single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells, respectively. Greatly enhanced light stabilities with T87 of &gt;1200 h and 85 &#176;C thermal stability with T85 of &gt;1500 h are achieved by using the SnOCl HTM.








Abstract
Tin&#8211;lead (Sn&#8211;Pb) narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskites show great potential in both single&#8208;junction and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells. Sn&#8211;Pb perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are still limited by low charge collection efficiency and poor stability. Here, a ternary Sn (II) alloy of SnOCl is reported as the hole&#8208;transport material (HTM) with a work function of 4.95&#160;eV for Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs. The solution&#8208;processed SnOCl layer has a texture structure that not only reduces the optical loss of the devices, but also changes grain growth of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites and boosts the carrier diffusion length to 3.63&#160;&#181;m. The formation of small perovskite grains at the HTM/perovskite interface is suppressed. These result in an almost constant internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of 96 &#177; 2% across the absorption spectrum of Sn&#8211;Pb perovskites. The SnOCl HTM significantly enhances the stability of Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs with 87% of its initial efficiency retained after 1&#8208;sun illumination for 1200&#160;h, and keeps 85% efficiency under 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress for 1500&#160;h. The hybrid HTM further improves the stabilized efficiencies of single&#8208;junction Sn&#8211;Pb PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells to 23.2% and 25.9%, respectively. This discovery opens an avenue to the multicomponent metal alloys as HTM in PSCs.

         <title>Isolating Contiguous Ir Atoms and Forming Ir&#8211;W Intermetallics with Negatively Charged Ir for Efficient NO Reduction by CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst (IrW&#8208;WO3/KIT&#8208;6) containing only 1&#160;wt% Ir is synthesized for efficient catalytic reduction of NO by CO to N2 under O2&#8208;containing conditions. This catalyst consists of ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6) supported with WO3 nanoparticles, and the latter is covered with atomic&#8208;dispersed IrW intermetallics.








Abstract
The lack of efficient catalysts with a wide working temperature window and vital O2 and SO2 resistance for selective catalytic reduction of NO by CO (CO&#8208;SCR) largely hinders its implementation. Here, a novel Ir&#8208;based catalyst with only 1&#160;wt% Ir loading is reported for efficient CO&#8208;SCR. In this catalyst, contiguous Ir atoms are isolated into single atoms, and Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles are formed, which are supported on ordered mesoporous SiO2 (KIT&#8208;6). Notably, this catalyst enables complete NO conversion to N2 at 250&#160;&#176;C in the presence of 1% O2 and has a wide temperature window (250&#8211;400&#160;&#176;C), outperforming the comparison samples with Ir isolated&#8208;single&#8208;atomic&#8208;sites and Ir nanoparticles, respectively. Also, it possesses a high SO2 tolerance. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that single Ir atoms are negatively charged, dramatically enhancing the NO dissociation, while the Ir&#8211;W intermetallic nanoparticles accelerate the reduction of the N2O and NO2 intermediates by CO.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning Spectral Indicators of Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A data&#8208;driven classifier of band topology for a database of over 10&#160;000 compounds using X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) features as input, achieving over 90% accuracy is developed. By leveraging the simplicity and versatility of XAS, this classifier has the potential to accelerate the discovery and screening of a much broader category of candidate topological materials.








Abstract
Topological materials discovery has emerged as an important frontier in condensed matter physics. While theoretical classification frameworks have been used to identify thousands of candidate topological materials, experimental determination of materials&#8217; topology often poses significant technical challenges. X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a widely used materials characterization technique sensitive to atoms&#8217; local symmetry and chemical bonding, which are intimately linked to band topology by the theory of topological quantum chemistry (TQC). Moreover, as a local structural probe, XAS is known to have high quantitative agreement between experiment and calculation, suggesting that insights from computational spectra can effectively inform experiments. In this work, computed X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure (XANES) spectra of more than 10&#160;000 inorganic materials to train a neural network (NN) classifier that predicts topological class directly from XANES signatures, achieving F1 scores of 89% and 93% for topological and trivial classes, respectively is leveraged. Given the simplicity of the XAS setup and its compatibility with multimodal sample environments, the proposed machine&#8208;learning&#8208;augmented XAS topological indicator has the potential to discover broader categories of topological materials, such as non&#8208;cleavable compounds and amorphous materials, and may further inform field&#8208;driven phenomena in situ, such as magnetic field&#8208;driven topological phase&#160;transitions.

         <title>Engineered Extracellular Vesicles with SHP2 High Expression Promote Mitophagy for Alzheimer's Disease Treatment</title>

Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). A platform for AD therapy using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2) is developed. MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates apoptosis, oxidation, and neuroinflammation, accompanied by rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in AD.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction is a fundamental pathological feature of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, toxicity and poor brain enrichment of existing mitophagy inducers limit their further applications. In this study, a platform for AD therapy is developed using nanosized mesenchymal&#8208;stem&#8208;cells&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles with tyrosine phosphatase&#8208;2 (SHP2) high&#8208;expression (MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2). The high blood&#8211;brain barrier penetration ability of MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 is demonstrated in AD&#8208;mice, facilitating SHP2 delivery to the brain. In addition, MSC&#8208;EVs&#8208;SHP2 significantly induces mitophagy of neuronal cells, which alleviates mitochondrial damage&#8208;mediated apoptosis and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Mitophagy further diminishes neuronal cells apoptosis and neuroinflammation, culminating with rescued synaptic loss and cognitive decline in an AD mouse model. The EV&#8208;engineering technology provides a potential platform for effective AD therapy by inducing mitophagy.

         <title>Unique Role of GeO2 as a Noninvasive Promoter of Nano&#8208;Sized Zeolite Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Germanium oxide can function as a modifier of zeolite crystallization counter to its conventional role as a heteroatom. This effect is observed for two zeolite frameworks wherein GeO2&#160;addition promotes the formation of nano&#8208;sized crystals. Catalytic tests reveal significant enhancement in their performance, suggesting this method can be a commercially viable route to reduce mass transport limitations in zeolites.








Abstract
The synthesis of zeolites with nano&#8208;sized dimensions is often limited to a narrow design space that conventionally relies upon the design of organics to direct hierarchical materials. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of an inorganic modifier, germanium oxide (GeO2), to a zeolite growth mixture directs the formation of crystals with ultrasmall dimensions. This effect is observed for zeolites ZSM&#8208;11&#160;and ZSM&#8208;5 over a range of synthesis conditions wherein the role of GeO2&#160;in zeolite crystallization deviates from its typical function as a heteroatom. Notably, the final products contain trace amounts of Ge, which indicates the inorganic modifier does not compete for sites in the zeolite framework based on its formation of a discrete phase that enables GeO2&#160;recovery. Catalytic tests using the methanol&#8208;to&#8208;hydrocarbons reaction reveal significant enhancement in the performance of zeolite catalysts prepared with GeO2&#160;compared to reported examples of nano&#8208;sized zeolites. These findings highlight a potentially generalizable and commercially viable synthesis method to reduce mass&#8208;transport limitations in zeolites for diverse applications.

         <title>Electro&#8211;Chemo&#8211;Mechanical Failure of Solid Electrolytes Induced by Growth of Internal Lithium Filaments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiphysics simulation presents electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical failure of solid electrolyte caused by internal electroplating of lithium (Li) through visualizing local stress, damage accumulation, and crack propagation. The results show that geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the solid electrolyte are critical factors dominating degradation of solid electrolytes, providing novel insights for design of future solid&#8208;state batteries.








Abstract
Growth of lithium (Li) filaments within solid electrolytes, leading to mechanical degradation of the electrolyte and even short circuit of the cell under high current density, is a great barrier to commercialization of solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries. Understanding of this electro&#8211;chemo&#8211;mechanical phenomenon is hindered by the challenge of tracking local fields inside the solid electrolyte. Here, a multiphysics simulation aiming to investigate evolution of the mechanical failure of the solid electrolyte induced by the internal growth of Li is reported. Visualization of local stress, damage, and crack propagation within the solid electrolyte enables examination of factors dominating the degradation process, including the geometry, number, and size of Li filaments and voids in the&#160;electrolyte. Relative damage induced by locally high stress is found to preferentially occur in the region of the electrolyte/Li interface having great fluctuations. A high number density of Li filaments or voids triggers integration of damage and crack networks by enhanced propagation. This model is built on coupling of mechanical and electrochemical processes for internal plating of Li, revealing evolution of multiphysical fields that can barely be captured by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art experimental techniques. Understanding mechanical degradation of solid electrolytes with the presence of Li filaments paves the way to design advanced solid electrolytes for future solid&#8208;state Li&#8208;metal batteries.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Cascade Responsive Nanoparticles Enhance Pancreatic Cancer Therapy by Eliminating Tumor&#8208;Resident Intracellular Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticles, consisting of a hyaluronic acid shell and a core assembled by an antibacterial polymer, are proposed. The nanoparticles sequentially trigger active tumor targeting, deep tumor penetration, efficient killing of intratumoral bacteria, and controlled drug release. The nanoparticles augment anticancer efficacy by eliminating tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria via non&#8208;antibiotic therapy.








Abstract
The limited drug penetration and robust bacteria&#8208;mediated drug inactivation in pancreatic cancer result in the failure of chemotherapy. To fight against these issues, a dual&#8208;cascade responsive nanoparticle (sNP@G/IR) that can sequentially trigger deep penetration, killing of intratumor bacteria, and controlled release of chemo&#8208;drug, is reported. sNP@G/IR consists of a hyaluronic acid (HA) shell and glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive polymer&#8208;core (NP@G/IR), that encapsulates gemcitabine (Gem) and photothermal agent (IR1048). The polymer core, as an antibiotic alternative, is tailored to exert optimal antibacterial activity and selectivity. sNP@G/IR actively homes in on the tumor due to the CD44 targeting of the HA shell, which is subsequently degraded by the hyaluronidase in the extracellular matrix. The resultant NP@G/IR in decreased size and reversed charge facilitates deep tumor penetration. After cellular endocytosis, the exposed guanidine on NP@G/IR kills intracellular bacteria through disrupting cell membranes. Intracellular GSH further triggers the controlled release of the&#160;cargo. Thus, the protected Gem eventually induces cell apoptosis. Under laser irradiation, the hyperthermia of IR1048 helps further elimination of tumors and bacteria. Moreover, sNP@G/IR activates immune response, thereby reinforcing anticancer capacity. Therefore, this dual&#8208;cascade responsive sNP@G/IR eliminates tumor&#8208;resident intracellular bacteria and augments drug delivery efficacy, providing a new avenue for improving cancer therapy.

         <title>Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self&#8208;Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self&#8208;assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.








Abstract
The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self&#8208;assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky&#8208;end cohesion.

     alt="Augmented DNA Nanoarchitectures: A Structural Library of 3D Self-Assembling Tensegrity Triangle Variants"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The achievement of DNA tensegrity triangle crystals promises the ability to manipulate macroscopic crystalline matter with atomic precision, but a systematic characterization of the ensuing materials has not been previously performed. A generalizable strategy for constructing nanoscale DNA tensegrity architectures, with particular focus on geometrically&#160;asymmetric building blocks for the self-assembly of expanded and tunable crystalline nanomaterials is presented here.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The DNA tensegrity triangle is known to reliably self-assemble into a 3D rhombohedral crystalline lattice via sticky-end cohesion. Here, the library of accessible motifs is expanded through&#160;covalent extensions of intertriangle regions and sticky-end-coordinated linkages of adjacent triangles with double helical segments&#160;using both geometrically symmetric and asymmetric configurations. The molecular structures of 18&#160;self-assembled architectures at resolutions of 3.32&#8211;9.32&#160;&#197; are reported; the observed cell dimensions, cavity sizes, and cross-sectional areas agree with theoretical expectations. These data demonstrate that fine control over triclinic and rhombohedral crystal parameters and the customizability of more complex 3D DNA lattices are attainable via rational design. It is anticipated that augmented DNA architectures may be fine-tuned for the self-assembly of designer nanocages, guest&#8211;host complexes, and proscriptive 3D nanomaterials, as originally envisioned. Finally, designer asymmetric crystalline building blocks can be seen as a first step toward controlling and encoding information in three dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Tensegrity Architectures
In article number 2206876, Ruojie Sha and co&#8208;workers develop a structural library of augmented tensegrity architectures based on geometric expansion of triangular tiles. The highly asymmetric structure highlighted in the crystal lattice contains three linearly independent design axes that lay the foundation for the self&#8208;assembly of designer, heterogenous nanomaterials.

Organic Sonosensitizers
A new strategy of organic sonosensitizers based on boron&#8208;doped acenethiophene scaffolds is presented by Zhenqi Jiang, Frieder J&#228;kle, Xiaodong Yin, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2206594. Ultrasound irradiation of water&#8208;dispersible nanoparticle BAnTh&#8208;NPs and BTeTh&#8208;NPs can efficiently generate &#8226;OH while exhibiting low phototoxicity. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that boron&#8208;doped acenethiophenes exhibit high SDT efficiency with excellent biocompatibility.

Microgels
In article number 2205498, Sehoon Kim, Heemin Kang, and co&#8208;workers report the remote control of microgels via tissue&#8208;penetrative light. The microgels are electrostatically stabilized by cationic photoisomers and polyanions. Near&#8208;infrared&#8208;light&#8208;upconverted ultraviolet light using upconversion nanoparticles stimulates in situ swelling of the microgels and release of loaded cytokines, which facilitates pro&#8208;regenerative and anti&#8208;inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Microgels&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202205498"&gt;2205498&lt;/a&gt;, Sehoon Kim, Heemin Kang, and co-workers report the remote control of microgels via tissue-penetrative light. The microgels are electrostatically stabilized by cationic photoisomers and polyanions. Near-infrared-light-upconverted ultraviolet light using upconversion nanoparticles stimulates in situ swelling of the microgels and release of loaded cytokines, which facilitates pro-regenerative and anti-inflammatory polarization of macrophages.

         <title>Maneuvering Applications of Covalent Organic Frameworks via Framework&#8208;Morphology Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The relation between morphology&#8211;structure and applications is intricate in covalent organic frameworks. This review highlights the progressive utilization of morphology&#8211;structure design toward the success of various applications. Furthermore, an outlook is put forward for improving the material performance by controlling the morphology&#8211;application design space.








Abstract
Translating the performance of covalent organic frameworks (COFs) from laboratory to macroscopic reality demands specific morphologies. Thus, the advancement in morphological modulation has recently gained some momentum. A clear understanding of nano&#8208; to macroscopic architecture is critical to determine, optimize, and improve performances of this atomically precise porous material. Along with their chemical compositions and molecular frameworks, the prospect of morphology in various applications should be discussed and highlighted. A thorough insight into morphology versus application will help produce better&#8208;engineered COFs for practical implications. 2D and 3D frameworks can be transformed into various solids such as nanospheres, thin films, membranes, monoliths, foams, etc., for numerous applications in adsorption, separation photocatalysis, the carbon dioxide reduction, supercapacitors, and fuel cells. However, the research on COF chemistry mainly focuses on correlating structure to property, structure to morphology, and structure to applications. Here, critical insights on various morphological evolution and associated applications are provided. In each case, the underlying role of morphology is unveiled. Toward the end, a correlation between morphology and application is provided for the future development of COFs.

         <title>Catalytic Effects of Electrodes and Electrolytes in Metal&#8211;Sulfur Batteries: Progress and Prospective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 49, December 8, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with proper catalytic effects are promising in improving the performance of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries. To promote the commercialization process of metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in the future, the research progress of catalytic effects in metal&#8211;sulfur batteries in recent years is reviewed, and the development direction of catalytic effects for next&#8208;generation metal&#8211;sulfur batteries is discussed.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;sulfur (M&#8211;S) batteries are promising energy&#8208;storage devices due to their advantages such as large energy density and the low cost of the raw materials. However, M&#8211;S batteries suffer from many drawbacks. Endowing the electrodes and electrolytes with the proper catalytic activity is crucial to improve the electrochemical properties of M&#8211;S batteries. With regard to the S cathodes, advanced electrode materials with enhanced electrocatalytic effects can capture polysulfides and accelerate electrochemical conversion and, as for the metal anodes, the proper electrode materials can provide active sites for metal deposition to reduce the deposition potential barrier and control the electroplating or stripping process. Moreover, an advanced electrolyte with desirable design can catalyze electrochemical reactions on the cathode and anode in high&#8208;performance M&#8211;S batteries. In this review, recent progress pertaining to the design of advanced electrode materials and electrolytes with the proper catalytic effects is summarized. The current progress of S cathodes and metal anodes in different types of M&#8211;S batteries are discussed and future development directions are described. The objective is to provide a comprehensive review on the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art S cathodes and metal anodes in M&#8211;S batteries and research guidance for future development of this important class of batteries.

         <title>Challenges of Wafer&#8208;Scale Integration of 2D Semiconductors for High&#8208;Performance Transistor Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
MX2&#8208;based devices for high&#8208;performance circuits are expected to be introduced in production after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET. A stacked&#8208;sheet MX2 device will look like that prepared by process simulation. The status of the process development needed to produce such a device in a fab environment, and the gaps to be overcome are described.








Abstract
Large&#8208;area 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based devices may find applications as sensor or photonics devices or can be incorporated in the back end of line (BEOL) to provide additional functionality. The introduction of highly scaled 2D&#8208;based circuits for high&#8208;performance logic applications in production is projected to be implemented after the Si&#8208;sheet&#8208;based CFET devices. Here, a view on the requirements needed for full wafer integration of aggressively scaled 2D&#8208;based logic circuits, the status of developments, and the definition of the gaps to be bridged is provided. Today, typical test vehicles for 2D devices are single&#8208;sheet devices fully integrated in a lab environment, but transfer to a more scaled device in a fab environment has been demonstrated. This work reviews the status of the module development, including considerations for setting up fab&#8208;compatible process routes for single&#8208;sheet devices. While further development on key modules is still required, substantial progress is made for MX2 channel growth, high&#8208;k dielectric deposition, and contact engineering. Finally, the process requirements for building ultra&#8208;scaled stacked nanosheets are also reflected on.

         <title>2D Materials&#8208;Based Static Random&#8208;Access Memory</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The optimized two&#8208;dimensional material (2DM) static random&#8208;access memory designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet gate&#8208;all&#8208;around structure to 2DMs further improves speed and area density, showing the feasible scaling path beyond the Si technology. The process challenges of 2DM nanosheet field&#8208;effect transistors are also discussed.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WSe2, with adequate bandgaps are promising channel materials for ultrascaled logic transistors. This scalability study of 2D material (2DM)&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) and static random&#8208;access memory (SRAM) cells analyzing the impact of layer thickness reveals that the monolayer 2DM FET with superior electrostatics is beneficial for its ability to mitigate the read&#8211;write conflict in an SRAM cell at scaled technology nodes (1&#8211;2.1&#160;nm). Moreover, the monolayer 2DM SRAM exhibits lower cell read access time and write time than the bilayer and trilayer 2DM SRAM cells at fixed leakage power. This simulation predicts that the optimization of 2DM SRAM designed with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art contact resistance, mobility, and equivalent oxide thickness leads to excellent stability and operation speed at the 1&#8208;nm node. Applying the nanosheet (NS) gate&#8208;all&#8208;around (GAA) structure to 2DM further reduces cell read access time and write time and improves the area density of the SRAM cells, demonstrating a feasible scaling path beyond Si technology using 2DM NSFETs. In addition to the device design, the process challenges for 2DM NSFETs, including the cost&#8208;effective stacking of 2DM layers, formation of electrical contacts, suspended 2DM channels, and GAA structures, are also discussed.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>Pass&#8208;Transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale 2D Semiconductors</title>

A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is realized on a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 wafer. Such preliminary integration efforts exhibit a promising future for 2D semiconductors in integrated circuit application.








Abstract
2D semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit&#8208;level optimization. Herein, a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film is successfully synthesized, which is then used to fabricate top&#8208;gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as static random access memory and ring oscillators are examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS is then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which are successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Defect&#8208;Free Metal Deposition on 2D Materials via Inkjet Printing Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The evaporation of Au or the sputtering of Cr on 2D layered hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) produces local atomic defects in its structure, specially at its interfaces, which increases the leakage current across it. It is found that the deposition of metal on hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) using inkjet printing does not introduce any defect, and maintains its layered structure free of defects.








Abstract
2D materials have many outstanding properties that make them attractive for the fabrication of electronic devices, such as high conductivity, flexibility, and transparency. However, integrating 2D materials in commercial devices and circuits is challenging because their structure and properties can be damaged during the fabrication process. Recent studies have demonstrated that standard metal deposition techniques (like electron beam evaporation and sputtering) significantly damage the atomic structure of 2D materials. Here it is shown that the deposition of metal via inkjet printing technology does not produce any observable damage in the atomic structure of ultrathin 2D materials, and it can keep a sharp interface. These conclusions are supported by abundant data obtained via atomistic simulations, transmission electron microscopy, nanochemical metrology, and device characterization in a probe station. The results are important for the understanding of inkjet printing technology applied to 2D materials, and they could contribute to the better design and optimization of electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Precise Layer Control and Electronic State Modulation of a Transition Metal Dichalcogenide via Phase&#8208;Transition&#8208;Induced Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth is effective for synthesizing layer&#8208;controlled and electronic&#8208;state&#8208;modulated MoS2 films. The energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy is efficiently converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film on a wafer scale with excellent uniformity. The number of layers is precisely controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2.








Abstract
Wafer&#8208;scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase&#8208;transition&#8208;induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoSxOy (a&#8208;MoSxOy) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS2 film. The number of MoS2 layers is readily controlled layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a&#8208;MoSxOy, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom&#8208;inserted MoS2. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb&#8208;inserted MoS2 with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS2 effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.

The number of layers is precisely controlled layer-by-layer from one to eleven layers, which is applicable in the growth of both intrinsic and heteroatom-inserted MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wafer-scale growth of transition metal dichalcogenides with precise control over the number of layers, and hence the electronic state is an essential technology for expanding the practical application of 2D materials. Herein, a new growth method, phase-transition-induced growth (PTG), is proposed for the precisely controlled growth of molybdenum disulfide (MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) films consisting of one to eleven layers with spatial uniformity on a 2 in. wafer. In this method, an energetically unstable amorphous MoS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; (a-MoS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) phase is effectively converted to a thermodynamically stable crystalline MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; film. The number of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; layers is readily controlled layer-by-layer by controlling the amount of Mo atoms in a-MoS&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;O&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;, which is also applicable for the growth of heteroatom-inserted MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The electronic states of intrinsic and Nb-inserted MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with one and four layers grown by PTGare are analyzed based on their work functions. The work function of monolayer MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; effectively increases with the substitution of Nb for Mo. As the number of layers increases to four, charge screening becomes weaker, dopant ionization becomes easier, and ultimately the work function increases further. Thus, better electronic state modulation is achieved in a thicker layer, and in this respect, PTG has the advantage of enabling precise control over the film thickness.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Production of Large&#8208;Area Nucleus&#8208;Free Single&#8208;Crystal Graphene&#8208;Mesh Metamaterials with Zigzag Edges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable production approach of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials with zigzag edges is presented. The isotopic labeling approach and the high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization nucleus etching method are used to fabricate graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films on a Cu(111) substrate without chemical contamination and physical contact. The findings of this study provide insights for producing resist&#8208;free high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional metamaterial films.








Abstract
In addition to conventional monolayer or bilayer graphene films, graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials have attracted considerable research attention within the scientific community owing to their unique physical and optical properties. Currently, most graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials are fabricated using common lithography techniques on exfoliated graphene flakes, which require the deposition and removal of chemicals during fabrication. This process may introduce contamination or doping, thereby limiting their production size and application in nanodevices. Herein, the controlled production of wafer&#8208;scale high&#8208;quality single&#8208;crystal nucleus&#8208;free graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial films with zigzag edges is demonstrated. The 13C&#8208;isotopic labeling graphene&#8208;growth approach, large&#8208;area Raman mapping techniques, and a uniquely designed high&#8208;voltage localized&#8208;space air&#8208;ionization etching method are utilized to directly remove the graphene nuclei. Subsequently, a hydrogen&#8208;assisted anisotropic etching process is employed for transforming irregular edges into zigzag edges within the hexagonal&#8208;shaped holes, producing a large&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;quality graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterial film on a Cu(111) substrate. The carrier mobilities of the fabricated field&#8208;effect transistors on the as&#8208;produced films are measured. The findings of this study enable the large&#8208;scale production of high&#8208;quality low&#8208;dimensional graphene&#8208;mesh metamaterials and provide insights for the application of integrated circuits based on graphene and other 2D metamaterials.

         <title>High&#8208;Yield Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 Integrated Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Large&#8208;area transistor circuits are successfully fabricated using solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene as source/drain and gate contact electrodes, wafer&#8208;scale MoS2 film as the channel, and an ultrathin HfO2/Al2O3 layer of about 8&#160;nm as the dielectric layer. The high yield and performance uniformity of the device array indicate great potential for Ti3C2Tx MXene in large&#8208;area ultrathin 2D electronics.








Abstract
It is very challenging to employ solution&#8208;processed conducting films in large&#8208;area ultrathin nanoelectronics. Here, spray&#8208;coated Ti3C2Tx MXene films as metal contacts are successfully integrated into sub&#8208;10&#160;nm gate oxide 2D MoS2 transistor circuits. Ti3C2Tx films are spray coated on glass substrates followed by vacuum annealing. Compared to the as&#8208;prepared sample, vacuum annealed films exhibit a higher conductivity (&#8776;11&#8201;000 S cm&#8722;1) and a lower work function (&#8776;4.5&#160;eV). Besides, the annealed Ti3C2Tx film can be patterned through a standard cleanroom process without peeling off. The annealed Ti3C2Tx film shows a better band alignment for n&#8208;type transport in MoS2 channel with small work function mismatch of 0.06&#160;eV. The MoS2 film can be uniformly transferred on the patterned Ti3C2Tx surface and then readily processed through the cleanroom process. A large&#8208;area array of Ti3C2Tx MXene&#8211;MoS2 transistors is fabricated using different dielectric thicknesses and semiconducting channel sizes. High yield and stable performance for these transistor arrays even with an 8&#160;nm&#8208;thick dielectric layer are demonstrated. Besides, several circuits are demonstrated, including rectifiers, negative&#8208;channel metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (NMOS) inverters, and voltage&#8208;shift NMOS inverters. Overall, this work indicates the tremendous potential for solution&#8208;processed Ti3C2Tx MXene films in large&#8208;area 2D nanoelectronics.

         <title>Nonvolatile Logic and Ternary Content&#8208;Addressable Memory Based on Complementary Black Phosphorus and Rhenium Disulfide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Small&#8208;footprint nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide are demonstrated. A logic inverter with a high gain of over 270 and retention of 1000 s with a Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop feature is demonstrated by using only two transistors. Furthermore, a four&#8208;transistor nvTCAM cell with low processing temperature is realized with a high Rratio of &#8776;103.








Abstract
Hardware realization of in&#8208;memory computing for efficient data&#8208;intensive computation is regarded as a promising paradigm beyond the Moore era. However, to realize such functions, the device structure using traditional Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) technology is complex with a large footprint. 2D material&#8208;based heterostructures have a unique advantage to build versatile logic functions based on novel heterostructures with simplified device footprint and low power. Here, by adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism between a black phosphorus (BP) channel and a phosphorus oxide (POx) layer, a nonvolatile CMOS logic circuit based on 2D BP and rhenium disulfide (ReS2) with a high voltage gain of &#8776;275 is realized with a persistent hysteresis window. A Schmidt&#8208;like flip&#8208;flop using only two transistors is also demonstrated, with far fewer transistor numbers than the conventional silicon counterpart, which usually requires six transistors. Furthermore, four&#8208;transistor (4T) nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory (nvTCAM) cells are demonstrated with far fewer transistors for parallel data search. The nvTCAM cells exhibit high resistance ratios (Rratio) up to &#8776;103 between match and mismatch states with zero standby power thanks to the nonvolatility of the BP transistors. This back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line compatible nvTCAM shows advantages over other structures with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <dc:description>
Hardware implementation for reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is demonstrated with a unique 2T synaptic cell structure, which realizes the functions of both STDP and anti&#8208;STDP using a simple hardware structure. The total synaptic weight is increased (decreased) by applying feedback signal to gate1 or gate2 when, respectively, a positive or negative reward signal comes.








Abstract
Reward&#8208;modulated spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity (R&#8208;STDP) is a brain&#8208;inspired reinforcement learning (RL) rule, exhibiting potential for decision&#8208;making tasks and artificial general intelligence. However, the hardware implementation of the reward&#8208;modulation process in R&#8208;STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint. Here, a design with two synaptic transistors (2T) connected in a parallel structure is experimentally demonstrated. The 2T unit based on WSe2 ferroelectric transistors exhibits reconfigurable polarity behavior, where one channel can be tuned as n&#8208;type and the other as p&#8208;type due to nonvolatile ferroelectric polarization. In this way, opposite synaptic weight update behaviors with multilevel (&gt;6 bit) conductance states, ultralow nonlinearity (0.56/&#8722;1.23), and large Gmax/Gmin ratio of 30 are realized. By applying positive/negative reward to (anti&#8208;)STDP component of 2T cell, R&#8208;STDP learning rules are realized for training the spiking neural network and demonstrated to solve the classical cart&#8211;pole problem, exhibiting a way for realizing low&#8208;power (32 pJ per forward process) and highly area&#8208;efficient (100 &#181;m2) hardware chip for reinforcement learning.

However, the hardware implementation of the reward-modulation process in R-STDP usually requires complicated Si complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) circuit design that causes high power consumption and large footprint.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Bias Power&#8208;Detector Circuits based on MoS2 Field&#8208;Effect Transistors on Wafer&#8208;Scale Flexible Substrates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Power&#8208;detector circuits are realized based on MoS2 channel transistors fabricated on flexible polyimide substrates. The work compares the DC and radio&#8208;frequency performance of multilayer and monolayer wafer&#8208;scale grown MoS2 for power detection and shows that both materials allow the fabrication of circuits that work at GHz frequencies with excellent dynamic range and responsivity.








Abstract
The design, fabrication, and characterization of wafer&#8208;scale, zero&#8208;bias power detectors based on 2D MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) are demonstrated. The MoS2 FETs are fabricated using a wafer&#8208;scale process on 8&#160;&#956;m&#8208;thick polyimide film, which, in principle, serves as a flexible substrate. The performances of two chemical vapor deposition MoS2 sheets, grown with different processes and showing different thicknesses, are analyzed and compared from the single device fabrication and characterization steps to the circuit level. The power&#8208;detector prototypes exploit the nonlinearity of the transistors above the cut&#8208;off frequency of the devices. The proposed detectors are designed employing a transistor model based on measurement results. The fabricated circuits operate in the Ku&#8208;band between 12 and 18&#160;GHz, with a demonstrated voltage responsivity of 45&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 18&#160;GHz in the case of monolayer MoS2 and 104&#160;V W&#8722;1 at 16&#160;GHz in the case of multilayer MoS2, both achieved without applied DC bias. They are the best&#8208;performing power detectors fabricated on flexible substrate reported to date. The measured dynamic range exceeds 30&#160;dB, outperforming other semiconductor technologies like silicon complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor circuits and GaAs Schottky diodes.

         <title>Multilayer Reservoir Computing Based on Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Hierarchical Information Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stackable reservoir is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 with voltage input and output, enabling interdevice cascading and multilayer reservoir computing. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated in the deep reservoir architecture, providing a promising pathway for neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Dynamic physical systems such as reservoir computing (RC) architectures show a great prospect in temporal information processing, whereas hierarchical information processing capability is still lacking due to the absence of advanced multilayer reservoir elements. Here, a stackable reservoir system is constructed based on ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 devices with voltage input and output, which is realized by dynamic voltage division between a ferroelectric field&#8208;effect transistor and a planar device and therefore allows the reservoirs to cascade, enabling multilayer RC. Fast Fourier transformation analysis shows high&#8208;harmonic generation in the first layer as a result of inherent nonlinearity of the reservoir, and progressive low&#8208;pass filtering effect is realized where higher&#8208;frequency components are progressively filtered in deeper&#8208;layer RCs. Time&#8208;series prediction and waveform classification tasks are also demonstrated, serving as evidence for the memory capacity and computing capability of the deep reservoir architecture. This work can provide a promising pathway in exploiting emerging 2D materials and dynamics for advanced neuromorphic computing architectures.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;Timing&#8208;Based Adaptive Photoencoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent sparse and adaptive photoencoder using an optoelectronic integrated circuit constructed using monolayer MoS2&#8208;based 2D memtransistors is demonstrated. The photoencoder offers an energy&#160;and area efficient in&#8208;sensor encoding solution that can be transformative for the acceleration of spiking neural networks.








Abstract
The representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitutes the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here a medium&#8208;scale integrated circuit composed of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21&#160;memtransistors based on photosensitive 2D&#160;monolayer MoS2&#160;for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information, is introduced. It is shown that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, that is, higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in the photoencoder is exploited for adaptive photoencoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1&#160;&#181;J by the 2D&#8208;memtransistor&#8208;based photoencoder highlights the benefits of in&#8208;sensor and bioinspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

Logic Circuits
Are 2D semiconductors ready for next&#8208;generation IC application? In article number 2202472, Yufeng Xie, Lifeng Bian, Wenzhong Bao, and co&#8208;workers present a wafer&#8208;scale demonstration by circuit&#8208;level fabrication on a 4&#8208;inch MoS2 wafer. While pass&#8208;transistor configuration is more like an expedient to build logic circuits based on n&#8208;type MoS2, future development should add complementary p&#8208;type 2D semiconductors to realize more complex ICs.

Memory Cells
In article number 2106321, Yanqing Wu and co&#8208;workers report the smaller footprint of nonconventional computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory devices based on black phosphorus and rhenium disulfide transistors. By adopting the charge&#8208;trapping mechanism, four&#8208;transistor nonvolatile ternary content&#8208;addressable memory cells are realized for parallel search operations with reduced complexity and thermal budget.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the employment of graphene in microwave circuits is presented. The review starts with methods of the growth and transfer of graphene followed by different graphene&#8208;based devices. Thenceforth, exploiting these devices in different circuits is discussed. Finally, a perspective on the potential of graphene for enabling applications beyond the capabilities of classic semiconductors concludes this review.








Abstract
Over the past two decades, research on 2D materials has received much interest. Graphene is the most promising candidate regarding high&#8208;frequency applications thus far due to is high carrier mobility. Here, the research about the employment of graphene in micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits is reviewed. The review starts with the different methodologies to grow and transfer graphene, before discussing the way graphene&#8208;based field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (GFETs) and diodes are built. A review on different approaches for realizing these devices is provided before discussing the employment of both GFETs and graphene diodes in different micro&#8208; and millimeter&#8208;wave circuits, showing the possibilities but also the limitations of this 2D material for high&#8208;frequency applications.

         <title>Perspective of 2D Integrated Electronic Circuits: Scientific Pipe Dream or Disruptive Technology?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>

2D field&#8208;effect&#8208;transistors (FETs) are affected by time&#8208;dependent changes in their performance, which must be minimized for industrial&#8208;scale applications. In this work, the stability of circuits based on 2D transistors is evaluated. The results suggest that the performance parameters of certain material combinations for 2D FETs are already close to Si technologies. Furthermore, parameter variability criteria are formulated to evaluate the future development of 2D technologies.








Abstract
Within the last decade, considerable efforts have been devoted to fabricating transistors utilizing 2D semiconductors. Also, small circuits consisting of a few transistors have been demonstrated, including inverters, ring oscillators, and static random access memory cells. However, for industrial applications, both time&#8208;zero and time&#8208;dependent variability in the performance of the transistors appear critical. While time&#8208;zero variability is primarily related to immature processing, time&#8208;dependent drifts are dominated by charge trapping at defects located at the channel/insulator interface and in the insulator itself, which can substantially degrade the stability of circuits. At the current state of the art, 2D transistors typically exhibit a few orders of magnitude higher trap densities than silicon devices, which considerably increases their time&#8208;dependent variability, resulting in stability and yield issues. Here, the stability of currently available 2D electronics is carefully evaluated using circuit simulations to determine the impact of transistor&#8208;related issues on the overall circuit performance. The results suggest that while the performance parameters of transistors based on certain material combinations are already getting close to being competitive with Si technologies, a reduction in variability and defect densities is required. Overall, the criteria for parameter variability serve as guidance for evaluating the future development of 2D technologies.

         <dc:description>
The developments of circuit&#8208;level memory technologies and in&#8208;memory computing applications realized experimentally using 2D materials are reviewed. Reports on large&#8208;scale material synthesis methods, circuits with different levels of integration, logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory, and neuromorphic computing applications are systematically summarized. Major challenges and perspectives of large&#8208;scale 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory are provided.








Abstract
Memory technologies and applications implemented fully or partially using emerging 2D materials have attracted increasing interest in the research community in recent years. Their unique characteristics provide new possibilities for highly integrated circuits with superior performances and low power consumption, as well as special functionalities. Here, an overview of progress in 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory technologies and applications on the circuit level is presented. In the material growth and fabrication aspects, the advantages and disadvantages of various methods for producing large&#8208;scale 2D memory devices are discussed. Reports on 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory circuits, from conventional dynamic random&#8208;access memory, static random&#8208;access memory, and flash memory arrays, to emerging memristive crossbar structures, all the way to 3D monolithic stacking architecture, are systematically reviewed. Comparisons between experimental implementations and theoretical estimations for different integration architectures are given in terms of the critical parameters in 2D memory devices. Attempts to use 2D memory arrays for in&#8208;memory computing applications, mostly on logic&#8208;in&#8208;memory and neuromorphic computing, are summarized here. Finally, challenges that impede the large&#8208;scale applications of 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory are reviewed, and perspectives on possible approaches toward a more reliable system&#8208;level fabrication are also given, hopefully shedding some light on future research.

         <title>The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials&#8208;based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large&#8208;scale integrated circuits.








Abstract
2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS2 have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling&#8208;down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS2 beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high&#8208;density and low&#8208;power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS2 in large&#8208;scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.

     alt="The Trend of 2D Transistors toward Integrated Circuits: Scaling Down and New Mechanisms"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D materials show great potential to enable the transistor scaling down below 1&#160;nm node. This review focuses on the introduction of the optimization of 2D materials-based transistor, new mechanisms, design flow, and circuits, which indicate the trend of 2D transistors toward very large-scale integrated circuits.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D transition metal chalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, have recently attracted considerable research interest in the context of their use in ultrascaled devices owing to their excellent electronic properties. Microprocessors and neural network circuits based on MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; have been developed at a large scale but still do not have an advantage over silicon in terms of their integrated density. In this study, the current structures, contact engineering, and doping methods for 2D TMDC materials for the scaling-down process and performance optimization are reviewed. Devices are introduced according to a new mechanism to provide the comprehensive prospects for the use of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; beyond the traditional complementary&#8211;metal&#8211;oxide semiconductor in order to summarize obstacles to the goal of developing high-density and low-power integrated circuits (ICs). Finally, prospects for the use of MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in large-scale ICs from the perspectives of the material, system performance, and application to nonlogic functionalities such as sensor circuits and analogous circuits, are briefly analyzed. The latter issue is along the direction of &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; research.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Progress and Challenges for Memtransistors in Neuromorphic Circuits and Systems</title>

Recent progress and ongoing challenges for memtransistors are reviewed in the context of neuromorphic computing in solid&#8208;state circuits and systems. Gate&#8208;tunable learning and bio&#8208;realistic functions in multi&#8208;terminal synaptic devices are compared for memtransistors and related floating gate and ferroelectric memories, suggesting opportunities for new architectures that are suitable as hardware accelerators for artificial intelligence algorithms.








Abstract
Due to the increasing importance of artificial intelligence (AI), significant recent effort has been devoted to the development of neuromorphic circuits that seek to emulate the energy&#8208;efficient information processing of the brain. While non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) based on resistive switches, phase&#8208;change memory, and magnetic tunnel junctions has shown potential for implementing neural networks, additional multi&#8208;terminal device concepts are required for more sophisticated bio&#8208;realistic functions. Of particular interest are memtransistors based on low&#8208;dimensional nanomaterials, which are capable of electrostatically tuning memory and learning behavior at the device level. Herein, a conceptual overview of the memtransistor is provided in the context of neuromorphic circuits. Recent progress is surveyed for memtransistors and related multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices including dual&#8208;gated floating&#8208;gate memories, dual&#8208;gated ferroelectric transistors, and dual&#8208;gated van der Waals heterojunctions. The different materials systems and device architectures are classified based on the degree of control and relative tunability of synaptic behavior, with an emphasis on device concepts that harness the reduced dimensionality, weak electrostatic screening, and phase&#8208;changes properties of nanomaterials. Finally, strategies for achieving wafer&#8208;scale integration of memtransistors and multi&#8208;terminal NVM devices are delineated, with specific attention given to the materials challenges for practical neuromorphic circuits.

         <title>The Road for 2D Semiconductors in the Silicon Age</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 48, December 1, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon technologies, including 2D logic and memory devices, enabling the mitigation of challenges related to silicon integrated circuits (ICs) and even the creation of technologies beyond silicon, is highlighted. The progress of 2D IC applications and the prospects for realizing wafer&#8208;scale heterogeneous integration compatible with silicon ICs are also summarized.








Abstract
Continued reduction in transistor size can improve the performance of silicon integrated circuits (ICs). However, as Moore's law approaches physical limits, high&#8208;performance growth in silicon ICs becomes unsustainable, due to challenges of scaling, energy efficiency, and memory limitations. The ultrathin layers, diverse band structures, unique electronic properties, and silicon&#8208;compatible processes of 2D materials create the potential to consistently drive advanced performance in ICs. Here, the potential of fusing 2D materials with silicon ICs to minimize the challenges in silicon ICs, and to create technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture, is presented, and the killer applications for 2D materials in logic and memory devices to ease scaling, energy efficiency bottlenecks, and memory dilemmas encountered in silicon ICs are discussed. The fusion of 2D materials allows the creation of all&#8208;in&#8208;one perception, memory, and computation technologies beyond the von Neumann architecture to enhance system efficiency and remove computing power bottlenecks. Progress on the 2D ICs demonstration is summarized, as well as the technical hurdles it faces in terms of wafer&#8208;scale heterostructure growth, transfer, and compatible integration with silicon ICs. Finally, the promising pathways and obstacles to the technological advances in ICs due to the integration of 2D materials with silicon are presented.

Recent advances in emerging 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based integrated memory devices are reviewed in terms of working principles, device architectures, array integration, and specific brain&#8208;inspired applications. Future challenges and promising research lines toward reliable, practical neuromorphic computing chips are highlighted.








Abstract
With the advent of the Internet of Things and big data, massive data must be rapidly processed and stored within a short timeframe. This imposes stringent requirements on memory hardware implementation in terms of operation speed, energy consumption, and integration density. To fulfill these demands, 2D materials, which are excellent electronic building blocks, provide numerous possibilities for developing advanced memory device arrays with high performance, smart computing architectures, and desirable downscaling. Over the past few years, 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based memory&#8208;device arrays with different working mechanisms, including defects, filaments, charges, ferroelectricity, and spins, have been increasingly developed. These arrays can be used to implement brain&#8208;inspired computing or sensing with extraordinary performance, architectures, and functionalities. Here, recent research into integrated, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art memory devices made from 2D materials, as well as their implications for brain&#8208;inspired computing are surveyed. The existing challenges at the array level are discussed, and the scope for future research is presented.

         <title>Compact Modeling Technology for the Simulation of Integrated Circuits Based on Graphene Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>

         <dc:description>
The progress made toward the development of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors under DC, transient, AC, and noise analysis, is reported. This includes non&#8208;idealities such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, traps&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi&#8208;static&#8208;effects.

Abstract
The progress made toward the definition of a modular compact modeling technology for graphene field&#8208;effect transistors (GFETs) that enables the electrical analysis of arbitrary GFET&#8208;based integrated circuits is reported. A set of primary models embracing the main physical principles defines the ideal GFET response under DC, transient (time domain), AC (frequency domain), and noise (frequency domain) analysis. Another set of secondary models accounts for the GFET non&#8208;idealities, such as extrinsic&#8208;, short&#8208;channel&#8208;, trapping/detrapping&#8208;, self&#8208;heating&#8208;, and non&#8208;quasi static&#8208;effects, which can have a significant impact under static and/or dynamic operation. At both device and circuit levels, significant consistency is demonstrated between the simulation output and experimental data for relevant operating conditions. Additionally, a perspective of the challenges during the scale up of the GFET modeling technology toward higher technology readiness levels while drawing a collaborative scenario among fabrication technology groups, modeling groups, and circuit designers, is provided.
