         <title>Optical Tuning of Non&#8208;Equilibrium Surface Plasmon Resonances in a Narrow&#8208;Gap Semiconductor Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafast all&#8208;optical tuning of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic Fabry&#8211;P&#233;rot resonances is accomplished in single&#8208;crystalline InSb nanosheets. By exciting multi&#8208;valence band transitions, a high plasmon frequency ceiling of 1435&#160;cm&#8722;1 and sub&#8208;6 ps optical switching are achieved, enabling compact 2&#960; phase control. These findings highlight the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors for high&#8208;speed, programmable mid&#8208;infrared photonics.








Abstract
In photonics, the polaritonic nanocavity (PC) within the mid&#8208;infrared to terahertz region is pivotal in on&#8208;chip applications, spanning diverse domains such as bio&#8208;sensing and beyond&#8208;5G information processing. Nevertheless, the impediment posed by lattice vibrations' electrical neutrality restricts phononic PCs' active tuning through electro&#8208;optical methodologies. In response to this constraint, the potential of narrow&#8208;gap semiconductors is investigated, which is characterized by highly efficient optical carrier incubation capabilities to facilitate all&#8208;optical plasmonic PC tuning. Leveraging ultrafast nanoscopy, the temporal evolution of non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes is meticulously scrutinized in InSb nanosheets. These findings unveil that multi&#8208;valence band transitions engender substantial free carriers, culminating in optically tunable non&#8208;equilibrium plasmonic cavity modes with a rapid switching capability of less than 6&#160;ps, affording facile 2&#960; plasmonic phase control. This study substantiates the prospect that conventional III&#8211;V semiconductors offer a robust platform for tunable transient surface plasmon resonances, thereby paving the way for innovative integrated optical applications seamlessly adapting to established semiconductor technologies.

         <title>Reprogrammable Dual&#8208;Regulated Pollen Actuators for Geometric Encoding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging abundant natural pollen materials, a novel sustainable bilayer actuator demonstrating dual&#8208;layer modulation and complete re&#8208;programmability for controlled complex deformation is presented. The toner pattern defines deformation direction, while the pollen layer adjusts humidity responsiveness via pH. Along with complete reprogramming effectively encodes information through complex geometries as responsive smart devices.








Abstract
Bilayer actuators capable of autonomously responding to complex environmental stimuli have attracted increasing interest for their potential in intelligent and multifunctional systems. Yet, achieving simultaneous programming and reprogramming of shape transformations in both active and passive layers through scalable, sustainable methods remains a significant challenge. Here, a novel bilayer actuator derived from naturally abundant pollen is reported, offering unprecedented dual&#8208;layer re&#8208;programmability. The passive layer, composed of digitally patterned toner, dictates the deformation direction, with the folding angles ranging from 0&#176; to &#8776;152&#176;. Meanwhile, the active pollen layer exhibits tunable humidity responsiveness modulated by pH, controlling actuation curvature ranging from 0.036 to 0.28&#160;cm&#160;cm&#8722;1 and response speed ranging from 1.04 to 0.15&#176;&#160;s&#8722;1. Notably, the entire bilayer system can be fully disassembled via a mild, one&#8208;pot alkaline process, enabling more than 10 cycles of complete reprogramming without structural degradation. This dual&#8208;regulated architecture supports complex 3D geometric transformations and is demonstrated as a carrier of confidential information, encoding data through morphing analogs of encrypted binary code. By integrating programmable mechanics, renewable biomaterials, and energy&#8208;efficient reusability, this work establishes an eco&#8208;friendly and versatile platform for next&#8208;generation responsive materials and encrypted smart devices.

         <title>Ionotronics&#8208;Enabled Emerging Halide Perovskite Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide perovskites, with outstanding optoelectronic properties and structural tunability, hold great promise for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies. This review explores their ionotronic mechanisms, revealing how they enable high photosensitivity, tunable conductivity, and efficient luminescence. It also highlights advances in related optoelectronic devices and discusses prospects/challenges in the ionotronic&#8208;driven perovskite optoelectronics.








Abstract
With the rise of technologies such as artificial vision, smart wearables, and interactive displays, the demand for high&#8208;performance, intelligent, and portable optoelectronic devices has increased significantly. However, conventional silicon&#8208;based optoelectronic devices face limitations in perceiving, processing, and feeding back optoelectrical information, making them unable to meet increasing demanding performance requirements. Conversely, halide perovskites, characterized by excellent optoelectronic properties and high structural tunability, show great potential for advanced next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications. Recent studies have revealed diverse ionic and electronic behaviors that are crucial for achieving essential physical properties in the design of emerging optoelectronic devices. This review discusses the ionotronic mechanisms of halide perovskites and elucidates how these mechanisms enable high photosensitivity, tunable conductivity, and efficient luminescence. Recent developments in emerging photodetectors, neuromorphic processors, and full&#8208;color displays are discussed for intelligent applications. Additionally, the prospects and challenges of ionotronics&#8208;driven halide perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices are evaluated.

         <title>Scalable Solar Evaporator Based on Bandgap Engineered CuMnCrO4 Spinel Oxide with Salt&#8208;Resistant Property for Contaminated Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating multiple cations (Cu2&#8314; and Cr3&#8314;) into the Mn3O4 spinel lattice strategically tunes the electronic structure, narrowing the bandgap from 2.3 to 1.49&#160;eV. This enhances visible&#8211;NIR light absorption and photothermal conversion, enabling a high water evaporation rate of 4.1&#160;kg&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 under 1 sun. Beyond optical benefits, the multi&#8208;cation framework stabilizes the crystal structure, improves chemical resilience, and promotes uniform heat generation, enabling high, sustained solar evaporation rates over three weeks.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity demands innovative solutions that combine efficiency, durability, and scalability. Here, CuMnCrO4 (CMCO), is presented as a ternary spinel oxide photothermal absorber introduced for the first time in solar desalination, synthesized via co&#8208;substitution of Mn3O4 with Cu and Cr. This multi&#8208;cation design narrows the bandgap from 2.3 to&#160;1.49 eV, markedly enhancing solar absorption across the visible and near&#8208;infrared spectrum and enabling efficient light&#8208;to&#8208;heat conversion. Unlike conventional carbon or single&#8208;oxide&#8208;based systems, CMCO demonstrates&#160;record&#8208;high evaporation performance of 4.1 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under 1&#8208;sun, positioning it among the most efficient oxide&#8208;based ISSG materials reported to date. Equally novel is the&#160;integration of CMCO with a cotton fabric substrate and hydrophobic polyester strips in an inverted U&#8208;shaped configuration, which ensures continuous water wicking, localized salt separation, and mechanical robustness. This architecture delivers&#160;stable operation over three weeks without salt accumulation, overcoming a long&#8208;standing challenge in ISSG. Furthermore, the system retains high efficiency under strongly acidic/alkaline conditions and in oil&#8208; or dye&#8208;contaminated water, demonstrating unique resilience rarely reported in solar desalination systems. Finally, the modular design enables straightforward scalability from laboratory&#8208;scale strips to large&#8208;area panels. Together, these advances establish CMCO&#8208;based systems as a&#160;new materials platform for practical, durable, and scalable solar desalination, offering a sustainable pathway toward addressing global water scarcity.

         <title>Biomimetic Mineralized Hydrogels for Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to recapitulate the structural and compositional cues of native bone, have emerged as a leading candidate for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent advances in their design, focusing on innovative homogeneous and heterogeneous mineralization mechanisms. Moreover, their therapeutic applications are examined, and the discussion concludes with prevailing challenges and future directions for clinical translation.








Abstract
Bone mineralization is a tightly regulated process involving the deposition of hydroxyapatite and other calcium salt crystals within the collagen&#8208;rich extracellular matrix of bone tissue, which confers hierarchical architecture and exceptional biomechanical properties to bone through this organized biocrystal arrangement. Inspired by this natural process, biomimetic mineralized hydrogels, engineered to mimic the chemical composition, structural organization, mechanical strength, and osteoinductive capabilities of bone tissue, have garnered considerable attention as promising candidates for bone regeneration. This review systematically summarizes recent progress in the design and application of biomimetic mineralized hydrogels for bone regeneration. Following an overview of natural biomineralization principles, innovative strategies for constructing&#160;heterogeneous and homogeneous biomimetic mineralized hydrogels are first highlighted, emphasizing their structural and functional mimicry. Subsequently, their therapeutic applications are critically examined, including bone defect repair, osteochondral regeneration, osteoporotic bone repair, and other bone&#8208;related diseases (e.g., osteosarcoma, tendon&#8208;bone interface injury). Finally, persistent challenges are identified, and future research directions are proposed to advance these hydrogel systems toward clinical translation in bone tissue engineering.

         <title>Metabolic Osteoimmune Biodegradable Zn&#8211;Mn Alloys: High Strength&#8208;Ductility and In Situ Vascular&#8208;Osteogenic Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy is proposed to develop novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys, which achieve the highest SE among Zn alloys with yield strength &gt;350 MPa and elongation &gt;30%. This work unveils their strengthening&#8208;ductilization mechanism and an immunomodulatory&#8208;anti&#8208;inflammatory&#8208;metabolic osteogenic coupling cascade, providing a new paradigm for next&#8208;generation orthopedic implants.








Abstract
Driven by the demand for sustainable, safe, and cost&#8208;effective medical materials, design of biodegradable metals increasingly aims to achieve higher strength and biofunctionality with less alloying. This study proposes a high strengthening&#8208;efficiency (high&#8208;SE) design strategy and develops novel Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg and Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Li alloys. With total alloying additions below 1 wt.%, these alloys achieve yield strength of 369&#8211;397 MPa, elongation of 42&#8211;57%, and remarkable strengthening efficiency (SE) of 6.4&#8211;6.8. These SE values represent the highest level among high strength&#8208;ductile Zn alloys (YS &gt; 300 MPa, EL &gt; 40%). Benefiting from the synergistic release of Zn2+, Mn2+, and Li+/Mg2+ ions, both the alloys exhibit superior antibacterial activity, cytocompatibility, controlled degradation rates, and in vivo osteogenesis, demonstrating excellent degradation&#8208;osteogenesis coupling effect. Notably, Zn&#8208;0.8Mn&#8208;0.1Mg further enhances osteogenesis by activating the PI3K/Akt/HIF&#8208;1&#945; signaling axis, which coordinates cascades of immunomodulation (e.g., IGF2, P2rx5), anti&#8208;inflammation (e.g., Nfkbia inhibition), and cellular energy metabolism (e.g., Ndufaf3), resulting in a more pronounced osteogenic effect. This work establishes a new paradigm for high&#8208;efficiency alloy design, achieving simultaneous breakthroughs in mechanical and biofunctionality, offering a promising framework for next&#8208;generation Zn&#8208;based orthopedic implants.

         <title>Phase Engineering of Nanogold: Non&#8208;Close Packed Square Planes in A&#8242;B&#8242; Stacking with a 0.5 &#197; Channel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure. This work presents an unusual non&#8208;close&#8208;packed phase attained in a 40&#8208;atom gold nanocluster, which is in contrast with the close&#8208;packed fcc quasi&#8208;isomer. The non&#8208;compact structure exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence, possessing a unique 0.5 &#197; channel. Its photoexcited state lifetime is nearly two orders of magnitude shorter than that of the fcc isomer.








Abstract
Crystal phase engineering of inorganic materials is one of the most important strategies for achieving new material properties and functionality. Gold is well known to adopt the face&#8208;centered&#8208;cubic (fcc) structure, and it remains challenging to create new phases, but recent research on nanogold has provided exciting opportunities by achieving 2H (note: H denotes hexagonal), 4H, and body&#8208;centered&#8208;tetragonal (bct) phases. In the current work, an unusual non&#8208;compact phase in 40&#8208;atom gold nanoclusters is reported, which is in contrast to the close&#8208;packed isomer of fcc structure. The non&#8208;compact isomer exhibits exclusive square planes in a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking, hence giving rise to a unique 0.5 &#197; channel, whereas the fcc isomer is composed of close&#8208;packed planes with a closed structure (i.e., no 1D channel). The two Au40 isomers lead to a nearly two orders of magnitude difference in electronic excited&#8208;state lifetime. The attainment of the new non&#8208;compact phase in nanogold presents potential opportunities in terahertz emission owing to the strong electron&#8208;vibration coupling, ion channeling and ion selection, artificial photosynthesis, and biocatalysis.

         <title>3D Chiral Perovskitoid&#8208;to&#8208;Perovskite Reconstructive Phase Transition Designed Molecular Ferroelectric Thin&#8208;Film with out&#8208;of&#8208;Plane Polarization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D chiral R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) ferroelectric thin films with preferred (00l) orientation can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the (00l) preferential orientation. This rearrangement triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation within the lattice, successfully switching polarization direction of the thin&#8208;film from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane.








Abstract
The realization of pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in ferroelectric thin films is crucial for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance microelectronics and miniaturized devices. Molecular ferroelectrics, which allow facile and large&#8208;area thin&#8208;film fabrication via solution processing, have gained tremendous attention in recent years. However, to date, molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization have never been reported due to the inconsistency of their random orientation with the polarization direction. Herein, 3D chiral alkali metal halide ferroelectrics R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 (AQ = 3&#8208;aminoquinolinium) are designed, of which thin films exhibit a highly preferred (00l) orientation. Notably, R/S&#8208;AQCsI3 can undergo an unprecedented reconstructive phase transition from hybrid 3D perovskitoid to perovskite structure while maintaining the thin films with the (00l) preferential orientation. More importantly, such a topological rearrangement of the 3D inorganic [CsI3]n2&#8722; framework triggers chiral AQ2+ cation reorientation in the lattice, which changes the polarization direction from b&#8208;axis in the polar perovskitoid phase to c&#8208;axis in the perovskite phase, enabling the variation from pure in&#8208;plane to pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in the thin&#8208;film. To the knowledge, this is the first report of molecular ferroelectric thin films with pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization. This work opens up an avenue for achieving pure out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization in molecular ferroelectric thin films.

         <title>Molecular Surface Engineering of Sulfide Electrolytes with Enhanced Humidity Tolerance for Robust Lithium Metal All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that the electrochemical, interfacial, and humidity stability of halide&#8208;doped sulfide electrolytes (LPSClBr) is significantly enhanced by an organic surface coating using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA). This single&#8208;step strategy enables robust interfacial protection, supports lithium metal anodes, and improves long&#8208;term performance in high&#8208;voltage all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, including anode&#8208;free configurations.









Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs) enable next&#8208;generation batteries due to their intrinsic safety and compatibility with lithium (Li) metal anodes. However, many SSEs, particularly sulfide&#8208;based systems, suffer from limited electrochemical stability and high moisture sensitivity. Here, the molecular surface engineering of Li argyrodite SSE, Li6PS5Cl0.5Br0.5 (LPSClBr), is reported using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li&#8208;OPA) in a single&#8208;step coating strategy to stabilize both anode and cathode interfaces. The Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated electrolyte maintains high ionic conductivity (&gt;2.5&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1) and retains &gt;92% of its initial conductivity after 24&#160;h dry room exposure (dew point &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C). At 2&#160;wt.% loading, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;coated LPSClBr achieves a critical current density of 2.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;1 and supports stable Li plating/stripping for over 400&#160;h at 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2. In NCM811 cathode&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state cells, it delivers 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.3&#160;C with &gt;99.7% Coulombic efficiency and 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles. In anode&#8208;free cell configurations, Li&#8208;OPA&#8208;modified electrolytes enhance interfacial stability and cycling performance. These results demonstrate Li&#8208;OPA as a scalable, high&#8208;performance interfacial modifier for sulfide&#8208;based solid&#8208;state batteries.

&lt;p&gt;It is demonstrated that the electrochemical, interfacial, and humidity stability of halide-doped sulfide electrolytes (LPSClBr) is significantly enhanced by an organic surface coating using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li-OPA). This single-step strategy enables robust interfacial protection, supports lithium metal anodes, and improves long-term performance in high-voltage all-solid-state batteries, including anode-free configurations.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid-state electrolytes (SSEs) enable next-generation batteries due to their intrinsic safety and compatibility with lithium (Li) metal anodes. However, many SSEs, particularly sulfide-based systems, suffer from limited electrochemical stability and high moisture sensitivity. Here, the molecular surface engineering of Li argyrodite SSE, Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PS&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;0.5&lt;/sub&gt; (LPSClBr), is reported using octadecyl phosphonic acid (OPA) and its lithiated form (Li-OPA) in a single-step coating strategy to stabilize both anode and cathode interfaces. The Li-OPA-coated electrolyte maintains high ionic conductivity (&amp;gt;2.5&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and retains &amp;gt;92% of its initial conductivity after 24&#160;h dry room exposure (dew point &#8722;50&#160;&#176;C). At 2&#160;wt.% loading, Li-OPA-coated LPSClBr achieves a critical current density of 2.4&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and supports stable Li plating/stripping for over 400&#160;h at 1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In NCM811 cathode-based all-solid-state cells, it delivers 160&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 0.3&#160;C with &amp;gt;99.7% Coulombic efficiency and 85% capacity retention after 100 cycles.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Regulation via a Volatile Morphology Director Enables Trap&#8208;Suppressed Organic Solar Cells with 20.6% Efficiency</title>

It is introduced 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both donor and acceptor phases. As validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion power conversion efficiency of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.








Abstract
Immense trap densities arising from faint donor self&#8208;assembly and excessive acceptor aggregation severely restrain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) in organic solar cells. Yet, most studies focus solely on acceptor regulation, and synergistic co&#8208;modulation of donor and acceptor phases for trap suppression has rarely been achieved. Here, 1,3&#8208;dibromo&#8208;5&#8208;iodobenzene (DBI) as a volatile solid additive with multiple noncovalent interactions to concurrently optimize both phases is introduced. Using PM6:Y6 as representative, from systemic coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamic simulation, in&#8208;situ synchronic and spectroscopy and transient optoelectronic characterizations, it is demonstrated that DBI can selectively bind with the fluorinated benzo[1,2&#8208;b:4,5&#8208;b&#8242;]dithiophene segments in PM6 backbone, which strengthens interchain interactions, enhances interchain packing density, and triggers the pre&#8208;aggregation of PM6 in solution state. Moreover, this preferentially precipitation of PM6 matrix sterically mitigates the oversized Y6 aggregation, which yields well&#8208;defined phase separation with appropriate domain sizes, which markedly substitute energetic disorder and trap density. As a result, the DBI treated devices yielded an elevated performance of 18.4% compared to 17.0% for reference devices. The generality of such strategy is also validated by PM6:L8&#8208;BO:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;F ternary system, where adding an optimal amount of DBI achieves a champion PCE of 20.6% with a boosted operational stability (T80:769&#160;h) under continuous light&#8208;soaking condition.

         <title>LEAD: Literature Enhanced Ab Initio Discovery of Nitride Dusting Layers for Enhanced Tunnel Magnetoresistance and Lower Resistance Magnetic Tunnel Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) using MgO tunnel barriers face challenges of high resistance&#8208;area product and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). To discover alternative materials, Literature Enhanced Ab initio Discovery (LEAD) is developed. The LEAD&#8208;predicted materials are theoretically evaluated, showing that MTJs with dusting of ScN or TiN on either side of MgO have lower resistance values and higher TMR than MgO junctions.








Abstract
Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) using magnesium oxide (MgO) tunnel barriers face challenges of high resistance&#8208;area product (RA) and low tunnel magnetoresistance (TMR). To discover alternative materials, Literature Enhanced Ab initio Discovery (LEAD) is developed as a framework that combines language models with first&#8208;principles screening. A domain&#8208;specific Word2Vec model is used to extract correlations from materials science literature, identifying promising candidates such as hybrid nitride&#8208;based barriers. Additionally, a Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers based masked language model is trained on the same corpus to capture deeper contextual relationships, identifying tantalum nitride (TaN), vanadium nitride (VN), and titanium nitride (TiN) as candidate barrier materials. These predictions are subsequently evaluated using density functional theory (DFT) simulations in QuantumATK, benchmarking the predicted materials' TMR and RA against MgO and scandium nitride (ScN). Results show that MTJs featuring a monolayer dusting of ScN, or monolayer or bilayer dusting of TiN, on either side of MgO have similar or lower RA while achieving higher TMR than pure MgO junctions. LEAD offers a scalable method for discovering tunnel barriers and highlights nitride dusting layers as promising for next&#8208;generation MTJ&#160;performance.

         <title>Moth&#8208;Wing&#8208;Inspired Multifunctional Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a moth&#8208;wing&#8208;inspired heterogeneous metamaterial that achieves synergistic broadband sound absorption, mechanical energy dissipation, and thermal insulation within a lightweight architected framework. Combining bioinspired gradient design, genetic&#8208;algorithm optimization, and additive manufacturing, the bionic heterogeneous acoustic metamaterial demonstrates superior multifunctional integration and applicability in advanced noise&#8208;control systems such as protective helmets.








Abstract
To evade ultrasonic predation by bats, moths have evolved wing scale architectures capable of absorbing and scattering high&#8208;frequency acoustic signals. Drawing inspiration from this natural defense strategy, a bioinspired multifunctional metamaterial is presented that integrates broadband sound absorption, thermal insulation, and mechanical energy dissipation within a unified structural framework. Inspired by the graded pore architecture of moth scales, acoustic performance is first optimized via genetic algorithm&#8211;driven pore design and the structures using 3D printing. The resulting metamaterial exhibits broadband acoustic absorption with an average coefficient of 0.742 across the 1000&#8211;6000&#160;Hz frequency range. When implemented in helmet&#8208;based noise reduction systems, the proposed metamaterial outperforms conventional commercial foams in suppressing environmental noise. In addition, the metamaterial retains a negative Poisson's ratio under large deformation, which enhances its mechanical energy dissipation and impact resilience. Furthermore, the alternating architecture of polymer layers and internal air cavities reduces the effective thermal conductivity to 30.2 mW&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1, ensuring excellent thermal insulation. This work demonstrates that leveraging biological architectures enables the simultaneous integration of acoustic, mechanical, and thermal functionalities in lightweight metamaterials, offering a new paradigm for multifunctional design.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane.








Abstract
This study employs molecular engineering to modulate HOMO levels and electronic structures, designing high&#8208;performance phthalate&#8208;based anodes (ZnPA, CaPA, CuPA) to address challenges like limited capacity and poor cycling in organic lithium&#8208;ion batteries. CuPA delivers 749 mAh g&#8722;1after 100 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and retains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. ZnPA achieves 650 mAh g&#8722;1at 0.1 A g&#8722;1and maintains 200 mAh g&#8722;1after 1500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. CaPA shows increased capacity at higher current (197 mAh g&#8722;1at 1 A g&#8722;1) due to (100) plane expansion. Redox mechanisms differ: CuPA and ZnPA carbonyl group facilitates lithium storage by a reversible enolization reaction, while the activated benzene ring exhibits redox activity for reversible lithiation/delithiation, with Cu2+ irreversibly reducing to Cu&#8314;, while Zn2+ remains stable. CaPA enables efficient lithium storage by the reversible intercalation and deintercalation of lithium ions on its (100) crystallographic plane. Full cells with LiFePO4 exhibit excellent performance: CuPA||LFP and ZnPA||LFP retain over 50% capacity after 1000 cycles; CaPA||LFP shows outstanding rate capability (103 mAh g&#8722;1at 4C). This work demonstrates that molecular structural engineering is an effective strategy for enhancing organic electrode materials.

         <title>Radiation&#8208;Resistant Aluminum Alloy for Space Missions in the Extreme Environment of the Solar System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrafine&#8208;grained aluminum crossover alloy exhibits unprecedented radiation resistance and mechanical stability under extreme irradiation doses up to 100 dpa. The exceptional resilience arises from thermodynamically stable T&#8208;phase precipitates, enabling lightweight structural materials for next&#8208;generation spacecraft and extraterrestrial applications where conventional Al alloys may fail under radiation exposure.








Abstract
Future human exploration of the solar system demands advanced materials capable of withstanding extreme environments, particularly exposure to solar energetic particle radiation. Current material selection criteria for space applications prioritize a high strength&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio, high corrosion resistance and manufacturability, favoring age&#8208;hardenable Al&#8208;based alloys. However, conventional precipitation&#8208;hardened Al alloys suffer from irradiation&#8208;assisted dissolution of strengthening phases at doses as low as 0.2 displacements&#8208;per&#8208;atom (dpa), undermining their performance. Furthermore, these alloys develop radiation&#8208;induced defects, such as dislocation loops and voids, even at low doses. This study presents a novel ultrafine&#8208;grained (UFG) Al&#8208;based alloy, designed using the crossover alloying concept and strengthened by T&#8208;phase precipitates, featuring a chemically&#8208;complex structure with 162 atoms in its unit cell composed of Mg32(Zn,Al)49. It is showed that T&#8208;phase precipitates have exceptional radiation tolerance up to 24 dpa. Owing to the nanoscale UFG structure, dislocation loops are suppressed, and voids are only observed beyond 75 dpa. Microtensile tests up to 20 dpa confirm the preservation of mechanical performance under irradiation. The results underline the potential of this alloy as a radiation&#8208;resistant, lightweight material for future space applications. Three key strategies enable this performance: (i) stabilization of a UFG microstructure, (ii) T&#8208;phase precipitation featuring a highly negative Gibbs free energy and chemically&#8208;complex giant unit cell, and (iii) precise process control to prevent grain growth during heat treatment and&#160;irradiation.

         <title>Sub&#8208;Melt Consolidation of Aerospace&#8208;Grade Thermoplastic Composites for High&#8208;Rate Processing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating amorphous PEI sheaths with semicrystalline PEEK, selectively thinned by picosecond laser ablation to form PEI&#8211;PEEK blending regions, creates a Goldilocks consolidation window that preserves crystallinity, minimizes resin&#8208;rich interlayers, and enables vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only processing at 300&#160;&#176;C&#8212;achieving fivefold faster consolidation and reducing energy use by 75% relative to conventional processing methods for aerospace&#8208;grade thermoplastic composites.








Abstract
The processing of thermoplastic composites is often limited by high energy demands and slow cycle times. Out&#8208;of&#8208;autoclave amorphous/crystalline thermoplastic materials for energy&#8208;efficient aerospace&#8208;grade laminates (OATMEAL) addresses these challenges through a unique prepreg architecture. OATMEAL consists of slow&#8208;cooled carbon fiber&#8208;reinforced semicrystalline polyetheretherketone (PEEK) tape sheathed in thin amorphous polyetherimide (PEI) layers. The PEI sheaths are miscible with PEEK and enable interfacial healing below the melting point of PEEK&#8212;preserving pre&#8208;existing crystallinity and reducing processing temperatures by 80&#160;&#176;C. The sheaths are thinned via high&#8208;frequency laser ablation down to the PEEK&#8211;PEI blending regions, thereby reducing residual stresses and promoting chemical resistance. Fast&#8208;cooled vacuum&#8208;bag&#8208;only oven processing of OATMEAL laminates yields aerospace&#8208;quality parts while enabling processing speeds more than five times faster and reducing energy use by roughly 75% compared with conventional methods. These results represent a significant advancement and a step toward truly high&#8208;rate, large&#8208;scale aerostructure manufacturing.

         <title>Inhibition of Interregional Charge Transfer Transition in Asymmetrical Heteroatomic Framework Enables BT.2020 Deep&#8208;Blue Electroluminescence with EQE Exceeding 40%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two triple&#8208;borylated isomers TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2 are designed via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Distinct interregional charge transfer contributions are identified in their excited states, resulting in different spectral behaviors across various environments. Consequently, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;boron/nitrogen/oxygen (B/N/O)&#8208;embedded polyaromatics featuring the multiple resonance (MR) effect are popular photoluminescent emitters that meet the BT.2020 blue standard, while they often fail to achieve this in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) because the uneven electron&#8208;donating properties of N/O atoms make them sensitive to their surrounding environments. Herein, taking such an emitter as the prototype and developing two triple&#8208;borylated isomers (TBNO&#8208;1 and TBNO&#8208;2) via &#960;&#8208;extensions and heteroatom regulations. Both emitters display highly efficient thermally activated delay fluorescence properties and nearly identical narrowband emission with CIE&#8208;y coordinates far exceeding the BT.2020 standard in toluene as the prototype does due to their similar core patterns. On the other hand, their emission spectra differ in other environments due to their different interregional charge transfer (IRCT) characters. Importantly, due to the strategically opposed oxygen atoms, TBNO&#8208;2 demonstrates uniformly delocalized wavefunctions and a much&#8208;suppressed IRCT contribution than TBNO&#8208;1, and thus exhibits minimal spectral variations across diverse environments. In OLEDs, while both emitters can afford impressive external quantum efficiency exceeding 40%, only TBNO&#8208;2 can afford electroluminescence satisfying the BT.2020 standard with CIE&#8208;y coordinate of 0.044. This work offers valuable insights for finely modulating the photophysical properties of MR emitters to realize BT.2020 blue electroluminescence.

         <title>Supramolecular Multivalent Synergy Enabling Harsh&#8208;Condition Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs) typically suffer from severe performance deterioration under harsh conditions, limiting their practical applicability. In contrast, harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials exhibit remarkable phosphorescence stability even in extreme environments, greatly expanding their potential applications. This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.








Abstract
Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen&#8208;mediated energy transfer, and solvent&#8208;induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh&#8208;condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.

This review highlights recent progress in HCP materials, encompassing design strategies, photophysical characteristics, and underlying mechanisms. Furthermore, emerging applications of HCP materials in afterglow displays, information encryption, sensing, and bioimaging are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic phosphorescence, which arises from the radiative decay of triplet excitons, has garnered significant interest owing to its exceptional photophysical properties and diverse application potential. However, the intrinsically vulnerable triplet excitons are highly susceptible to environmental factors such as heat, oxygen, and solvents, which significantly compromise the operational stability and durability of organic phosphorescent materials (OPMs). The triplet excitons undergo rapid deactivation via thermal dissipation, oxygen-mediated energy transfer, and solvent-induced collapse of rigid microenvironments, leading to severe phosphorescence quenching. Supramolecular multivalent synergy offers an effective strategy for stabilizing triplet excitons, thereby extending beyond ambient stability to sustained phosphorescence under harsh conditions, resulting in robust organic harsh-condition phosphorescence (HCP) materials. This review provides a timely and systematic introduction to recent advances in HCP materials, including design and construction strategies, unique optoelectronic properties, underlying stabilization mechanisms, and promising applications. In addition, the summary section highlights pivotal challenges and emerging perspectives within this field to suggest feasible pathways for future research endeavors. This review not only establishes design principles for HCP materials by decoding supramolecular multivalent synergy in triplet exciton stabilization but also paves new avenues toward practical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;Polar Order Engineering Enables Near&#8208;Ideal Efficiency in Lead&#8208;Free Energy Storage Perovskite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lead&#8208;free NaNbO3&#8208;based relaxor ferroelectrics achieve a record 95% efficiency and high dielectric energy density via multi&#8208;polar order engineering. Sub&#8208;angstrom electron polarization, atomic displacement enhancement, nanodomain design, and electrical microstructure unification enable ultrafast discharge and superior thermal stability, offering a sustainable alternative to toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics for high voltage capacitor applications.








Abstract
Toxic lead&#8208;based dielectrics dominate high&#8208;performance capacitors, creating urgent environmental and supply&#8208;chain challenges. Multi&#8208;polar order engineering is deployed to create an industrially scalable lead&#8208;free perovskite achieving simultaneous record efficiency (&#951; &#8776; 95%) and energy density (12 J cm&#8722;3). Phase&#8208;field simulations are also used to guide micro&#8208;to&#8208;nano domain design to construct switchable polar nano region that delay polarization saturation. Crucially, sub&#8208;angstrom electronic state optimization &#8211; previously unexplored in energy storage dielectrics &#8211; is revealed as pivotal: synchrotron XAS quantifies Nb&#8208;O dipole ionicity enhancement via electronic polarization, while atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy statistically confirms bond&#8208;length homogenization and distortion reduction that structurally anchor this effect. This hierarchical atomic&#8208;to&#8208;electronic control reshapes the electrical microstructure, enabling unified charge dynamics (validated by DRT analysis) that deliver ultrafast field response (&lt;32&#160;ns discharge) and exceptional thermal resilience (&lt; &#177;4% current fluctuation, 25&#8211;150&#160;&#176;C). Fabricated from commodity precursors, the material eliminates the reliance on rare&#8208;earth precursors that are common in PLZT production, significantly lowering costs while mitigating environmental impacts. Overall, this work establishes a sustainable pathway for grid&#8208;scale power electronics.

         <title>Archeo&#8208;Inspiration from the Cultural History of Glass: Historic Accounts, Anecdotes and Hard Facts as Challenges to Modern Material Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Glass, historically valued for its purity and durability, has long inspired artists and societies. This article introduces the concept of &#8220;Archeo&#8208;Inspiration&#8221;, drawing on cultural and historical contexts of glass to guide future material innovations. By revisiting ancient craftsmanship, modern science can find imaginative pathways for developing advanced glass technologies and material systems.








Abstract
Since its earliest developments, glass has held a unique place in cultural history. Remarkably, many surviving glass artefacts from premodern times still surpass some of today's standard processing techniques, with effects and qualities that feel strikingly contemporary. Valued for its optical purity, chemical and thermal resistance, hardness, and fragile beauty, glass has long captivated both artists and craftsmen. This paper proposes examining glasses within their cultural contexts as a source of inspiration for modern materials science. Throughout history, glass has held societal and symbolic significance, with diverse cultural accounts detailing its properties and uses. While not all historical records describe glass with scientific accuracy, many offer imaginative perspectives that can inform new developments. Just as fields like bionics and biomimetics look to nature for innovation, a culturally reflective scientific approach is suggested to glass material science, a concept &#8220;Archeo&#8208;Inspiration&#8221; is termed. This concept draws from the material knowledge and creative uses of past societies to inspire future advancements in glass technology and material systems. The aim is to move beyond purely technical evaluation by reconnecting with the rich heritage of glassmaking within its cultural and historical framework. In doing so, the hope is to offer both a retrospective appreciation and a forward&#8208;looking vision for material systems in the 21st century, grounded in the enduring legacy of one of humanity's most versatile and symbolically charged materials.

         <title>Platinum&#8208;Complex Acceptor Modulating Dielectric Constant and Exciton&#8208;Vibration Coupling for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells with Suppressed Energy Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is developed, featuring enhanced planarity and rigidity that suppress exciton&#8211;vibration coupling. Pt coordination increases the dipole moment and polarizability, boosting the dielectric constant. The resulting D18/L8&#8208;BO:PtHD ternary device achieves reduced energy loss (Eloss) and efficient exciton dissociation, delivering a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%.








Abstract
Excessive energy loss (Eloss) remains a primary bottleneck limiting further efficiency improvements in organic solar cells (OSCs). Mitigating energy losses is therefore a key prerequisite for advancing organic photovoltaic technologies. Rational acceptor molecular design that modulates the dielectric constant and exciton&#8208;vibration coupling of the active layer has emerged as a particularly promising route to achieving this goal. Herein, a platinum&#8208;complex&#8208;based non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (PtHD) is designed and synthesized. The molecule features high planarity and backbone rigidity, which effectively suppresses exciton&#8208;vibration coupling. Integrating the Pt coordination unit amplifies the molecular dipole moment and polarizability, consequently enhancing the dielectric constant of the active layer. A binary device based on D18/PtHD achieves a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.938&#160;V with a reduced Eloss of 0.525&#160;eV. Building on this achievement, by introducing PtHD as a guest component into the D18/L8&#8208;BO system and employing a layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition strategy to control the vertical distribution, the ternary device demonstrates an minimized Eloss and superior exciton separation, culminating in a remarkably high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.52%. This work highlights the crucial role of metal&#8208;complex acceptors in managing energy loss and charge dynamics, thus providing a molecular design paradigm to develop highly efficient organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Collagen&#8208;Derived Nanoconfined Catalytic Membranes for Highly Efficient Water Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable nanoconfined catalytic membrane is fabricated from collagen fiber networks via mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid&#8211;driven Fe3O4 mineralization. The hierarchical nanostructure enhances water permeation and reactive oxygen species utilization, achieving 98.2% tetracycline removal with ultrahigh permeance, providing a scalable, eco&#8208;friendly platform for wastewater treatment.








Abstract
Nanoconfined catalytic membranes (NCMs) are promising for advanced water treatment but often face trade&#8208;offs between permeability, stability, and catalytic efficiency. Here, the hierarchical architecture of collagen fiber networks (CFNs) is exploited to develop robust, efficient, and sustainable collagen&#8208;derived NCMs. Mechanical nanofibrillation and tannic acid (TA) functionalization generate highly dispersed fibrils and interconnected nanochannels that enhance water transport and active&#8208;site accessibility. TA further directs mineralization of Fe3O4 nanocatalysts and accelerates H2O2 activation, while the hierarchical porous structure promotes efficient utilization of reactive oxygen species. The resulting TA/Fe@CFN membranes exhibit high water permeance (2274.8 LMH bar&#8722;1) and achieve 98.2% tetracycline removal under flow&#8208;through conditions, along with efficient removal of antibiotic&#8208;resistant bacteria and genes in real medical wastewater. Mechanistic studies reveal that nanoconfinement is vital to the accelerated catalytic kinetics and enhanced Fenton activity. Life cycle and economic analyses further demonstrate that TA/Fe@CFN is a green and cost&#8208;effective alternative to conventional polymeric membranes. This work establishes a high&#8208;performance, environmentally compatible platform for wastewater purification and highlights the broad potential of upcycling animal byproducts into multifunctional materials for circular water technologies.

         <title>Lattice Distortion in High&#8208;Entropy Transition Metal Diselenide for Augmented Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Utilizing the lattice distortion effect, this study for the first time realize a unique distortion of the trigonal prismatic motif in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). This distorted lattice generates electron accumulation regions that serve as highly active sites, significantly enhancing the basal plane activity of TMDs for the electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
The high&#8208;entropy strategy offers a viable pathway to activate the inert basal plane of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) for electrocatalysis. This work demonstrates that the &#8220;lattice distortion effect&#8221;, one of the core effects of high&#8208;entropy materials, plays a crucial role in activating the basal plane of TMDs. A high&#8208;entropy diselenide (ReNbTaMoW)Se2 (denoted as HESe2) is synthesized via solid&#8208;state reaction. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and atomic resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy reveal a unique fivefold&#8208;modulated structure in HESe2, which unexpectedly distorts the rigid trigonal prismatic motif. HESe2 exhibits exceptional activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), showing a low overpotential of 31&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, comparable to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art precious metal catalysts. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy indicates that the distorted structure of HESe2 remains stable during the HER process. A proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolyser assembled with HESe2 cathodic catalyst shows competitive performance and durability with negligible degradation over 400 h. Density functional theory calculations reveal the electron accumulation regions induced by lattice distortion as high&#8208;activity sites, thereby driving the augmented HER performance of HESe2. This work presents a universal strategy for boosting the basal plane activity of layered materials through unique lattice distortion effect.

         <title>Synergistic Strategy of Targeted Capture and Potential Responsive Release for High&#8208;Performance Zinc&#8208;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively proposes a synergistic strategy of &#8220;targeted capture and potential responsive release&#8221;. By utilizing Bi2O3 to selectively capture I&#8722; and form BiOI, followed by their release at lower potentials, the strategy effectively suppresses shuttle behavior through the delayed release of I&#8722;, thereby enhancing the battery's cycling stability and capacity. 








Abstract
The shuttle effect, arising from the dissolution and migration of polyiodide species, severely hinders the practical application of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;iodine (Zn&#9472;I2) batteries. Conventional carbon&#8208;based cathode materials, relying on weak physical adsorption, fail to effectively confine iodine species. To address this issue, a synergistic strategy is proposed that combines the targeted capture of I&#8722; to form BiOI with the potential responsive release of I&#8722; from BiOI during the reduction of Bi3+ to Bi. This approach enables a dynamic and directional capture&#8208;release process at a potential lower than that required for the reduction of I2. This methodology is validated through ex situ spectroscopic analysis and Density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This decoupled mechanism suppresses polyiodide formation and ensures efficient cathode reversibility. The incorporation of Bi2O3 also introduces an additional redox couple, contributing extra capacity to the battery. The battery not only efficiently suppresses the inherent side reaction issues of zinc&#8208;iodine batteries, but also achieves a considerably high capacity level in the field of iodine single&#8208;electron conversion. This work provides a universal design principle for manipulating iodine electrochemistry, paving the way for high&#8208;energy, long&#8208;lifespan halogen&#8208;based batteries.

         <title>Synergizing Donor&#8211;Acceptor Ni&#8208;MOF with Lignin Proton Relay for Efficient and Selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a hybrid catalyst through incorporating carboxylated lignin (C&#8208;HL) and a single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF), which achieves efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction.








Abstract
Amidst the urgent global push for carbon neutrality, CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photoreduction has emerged as a critical technology for closing the carbon cycle and converting renewable energy. In this work, a hybrid catalyst, denoted as C&#8208;HL&#8208;20%/Ni(TTA)bpe (TTA = 4,4&#8242;,4&#8243;;&#8208;tricarboxy&#8208;triphenylamine, bpe = 4,4&#8242;&#8208;ethylenedipyridine), is constructed through the rational design of a composite system incorporating carboxylated lignin (C&#8208;HL) and a single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (Ni&#8208;MOF). The catalyst demonstrates impressive photocatalytic performance, achieving a CO production rate of 6516.4 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 with 98.3% selectivity, which has reached the top level of the reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Under outdoor conditions, it also demonstrates a stable CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 4282.5 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1. Experimental characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that this high activity originates from donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) artificial structure of the single&#8208;crystalline Ni&#8208;MOF and proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer (PCET) process. Modification with C&#8208;HL introduces enriched &#9472;COOH groups, which form hydrogen bonds with the Ni(TTA)bpe framework. This not only consolidates the structure but also shortens the electron migration pathway, thereby achieving efficient and selective CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO photo&#8208;conversion. This study establishes a rational catalyst design strategy for sustainable CO2 photoreduction, demonstrating a feasible pathway toward manageable carbon resource utilization.

         <title>Advancing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting with Z&#8208;Scheme Heterojunctions by Interfacial Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the interfacial manipulation in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS), focusing on the charge separation, extraction, and injection at the semiconductor&#8208;semiconductor and semiconductor&#8208;water interfaces to enhance POWS performance. Effective strategies for interfacial manipulation and advanced characterization techniques are summarized, and current challenges and future research directions for efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are also presented.








Abstract
Photocatalytic overall water splitting (POWS), as a promising technology for large&#8208;scale solar hydrogen production, has propelled the development of advanced photocatalysts. Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions are believed to be ideal candidates for efficient POWS due to the reconcilable benefits of broad solar spectrum absorption and sufficient redox potentials. POWS by Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions involves multiple&#8208;step charge transfer processes happening at the interfaces, thereby making interfacial manipulation crucial to improving the photocatalytic performance. This review delves into the intricate details of interfacial manipulation in Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions with an emphasis on the semiconductor&#8208;semiconductor interfaces and the semiconductor&#8208;water interfaces. First, the basic charge transfer processes are explored at the interfaces, and then summarize and explore the effective manipulation strategies to promote the interfacial charge transfer processes for enhanced POWS performance. Further, the advanced characterization techniques are introduced for understanding these interfacial processes. Finally, the current challenges and future directions are provided for the development of efficient Z&#8208;scheme heterojunctions for POWS.

         <title>Multimaterials by Patterning Microphase Separation of a Single Copolymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single copolymer is programmed into multimaterials by arresting microphase separation at different stages. This strategy enables seamless integration of regions resembling tough plastics or tough rubbers, providing a general platform for rigid&#8211;soft integrated devices.








Abstract
Living systems achieve robustness by integrating soft and rigid components into seamless architectures, yet synthetic emulation of this strategy remains limited. Here, we present a strategy to generate multimaterials from a single copolymer by patterning phase separation. Specifically, we design a block copolymer of metastable nanostructure, and then spatially program photocrosslinking to locally arrest phase separation at different levels during annealing, thereby producing patterns that span moduli from regimes of rubbers to plastics. The resulting multimaterial exhibits spatially distinct mechanical properties, but is chemically identical, and is seamlessly integrated through a shared polymer network topology. This approach inherently eliminates interfacial incompatibility of dissimilar materials, enhances structural integrity of the multimaterial, and establishes a versatile platform for programmable, multiscale rigid&#8208;soft integrated devices.

The resulting multimaterial exhibits spatially distinct mechanical properties, but is chemically identical, and is seamlessly integrated through a shared polymer network topology. This approach inherently eliminates interfacial incompatibility of dissimilar materials, enhances structural integrity of the multimaterial, and establishes a versatile platform for programmable, multiscale rigid-soft integrated devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>&#8220;Tear&#8208;And&#8208;Stack&#8221; Twisted SrTiO3 Moir&#233; Superlattices for Precise Interfacial Reconstruction and Polar Topology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack method enables the creation of twisted SrTiO3 bilayers with accurate twist&#8208;angle control, which yield atomically sharp oxide moir&#233; superlattices with emergent exotic topological polar vortices, thereby opening a new pathway for twistronics based on 2D&#8208;like non&#8208;van der Waals oxides.








Abstract
Oxide&#8208;based moir&#233; superlattice is an emerging field for its exotic properties and abundant design freedom. However, due to the dangling bond and much stronger interlayer adhesion with the supporting substrate, fabricating twisted complex oxide is challenging, and an oxide moir&#233; lattice with a clean interface remains elusive. Here, square moir&#233; superlattices in twisted SrTiO3 (STO) bilayer are constructed using a 2D like &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method, achieving unprecedent control resolution and superior interface quality. Through depth&#8208;dependent atomic&#8208;scale analysis and electronic reconstruction, the upper and lower STO layers are found near the twisted interface exhibit opposite shear strain, evidencing a strong coupling confined within 2 unit cells (&#177;0.8&#160;nm) from the interface. The strain gradient of twisted bilayer STO gives rise to alternating clockwise and counter&#8208;clockwise polarization originating from the flexoelectric effect, leading to a large&#8208;scale array of polar vortex. This motivates to fabricate twisted STO bilayers with a freestanding parent layer as thin as 0.8&#160;nm, in which a polar vortex is also confirmed. The &#8220;tear&#8208;and&#8208;stack&#8221; method is generic to create twisted moir&#233; superlattices in a wide range of oxide material systems, and it demonstrates the feasibility of &#8220;2D&#8208;like&#8221; oxide twistronics.

         <title>Utilization of Diamagnetic Force Introduced by External Magnetic Fields for Printing Scalable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rational control of photoactive film morphology is crucial for scalable organic solar cells. This study introduces a magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy to enhance the intermolecular interactions and guide molecular stacking. This method improves film homogeneity, minimizes defects, and reduces performance loss, offering a universal approach for printing high&#8208;quality photoactive films and multi&#8208;parameter optimization in organic electronics.









Abstract
The photovoltaic performance and stability of scalable organic solar cells (OSCs) are significantly governed by the micromorphology, molecular interactions, and stacking behavior of the active layer. As the device area increases, these effects are amplified, making long&#8208;range morphological control of small&#8208;molecule acceptors challenging and frequently leading to performance degradation. Herein, a non&#8208;contact and size&#8208;insensitive magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;assisted printing strategy is developed, which modulates the chemical environment of molecular end groups during film formation and enhances intermolecular interactions, thereby regulating the molecular stacking behavior. These collectively improve the film homogeneity, reduce the defect density, and minimize the performance loss in large&#8208;area devices. Finally, the optimal pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction OSCs, fabricated via air atmosphere printing, achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.23%. Furthermore, large&#8208;area binary modules with an aperture area of 25.00 cm2 retain an optimized PCE of 16.70%, underscoring their strong potential for scalable production. Overall, this work proposes a universal approach for printing high&#8208;quality photoactive films and provides a valuable framework for the collaborative optimization of organic electronic devices.

         <title>Antagonistic Iron Competition Induced by Iron Chelators Heightens Cuproptosis in Both Tumors and Intratumoral Bacteria</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the ancient fable &#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, this study develops a nano&#8208;chelator copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP) that not only depletes iron ions in the tumor microenvironment to turn tumor cells against bacteria, but also releases Cu2+ to induce cuproptosis in both, thereby achieving dual suppression of tumors and their resident bacteria.








Abstract
Both tumors and intratumoral bacteria exhibit iron addiction, a shared metabolic dependency that drives their proliferation. Here, inspired by the ancient Chinese fable&#160;&#8220;The Snipe and the Clam Grapple While the Fisherman Profits&#8221;, a nano&#8208;chelator,&#160;copper&#8208;deferiprone (Cu&#8208;DFP), is designed and synthesized to deplete iron ions by metal chelation therapy in the tumor microenvironment, thereby&#160;&#8220;sowing discord&#8221;&#160;between tumors and intratumoral bacteria and subsequently inducing&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. Specifically, capitalizing on the high iron stores in both tumor cells and intratumoral bacteria, coupled with the superior iron&#8208;chelating capability of DFP, Cu&#8208;DFP effectively hijacks iron ions from these cellular reservoirs while concurrently liberating substantial amounts of copper ions (Cu2+). Iron depletion not only&#160;exacerbates the antagonistic rivalry&#160;between tumors and bacteria but also&#160;disrupts their defense mechanisms&#160;against external stressors. Moreover, the released Cu2+ leads to&#160;excessive intracellular copper accumulation, triggering&#160;cuproptosis&#160;in both. The dying tumor cells and bacteria then release damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) and pathogen&#8208;associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), respectively, promoting dendritic cells (DCs) maturation and activating&#160;antitumor immune responses. By harnessing the iron&#8208;mediated metabolic competition to potentiate cuproptosis, this therapeutic strategy presents an innovative method for addressing intratumoral microbiota in oncology.

         <title>Highly Sensitive Thermoelectric Fabric of PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT@PU Composite Fibers for Body&#8208;Temperature Monitoring and Fever Alarming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT fibers, the assembled thermoelectric fabric demonstrates high and stable output performance under various mechanical deformations. A fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever&#8208;monitoring system enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time body&#8208;temperature tracking.








Abstract
Integrated flexible thermoelectric (TE) fabric demonstrates great potential for wearable energy harvesting and intelligent temperature sensing. However, existing TE fibers often struggle to simultaneously satisfy requirements&#160;for high and stable TE performance, favorable weavability, sweat resistance, and good biocompatibility. Herein, continuous PEDOT:PSS/SWCNT composite fibers with these desirable features are obtained via a convenient freeze&#8208;thaw&#8208;induced gelation process assisted wet&#8208;spinning process, exhibiting a high electrical conductivity of 1960 S cm&#8722;1, a large power factor of 59.6 &#181;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2, and a high tensile strength of 103 MPa. Polyurethane&#8208;encapsulated composite fibers further provide superior mechanical flexibility, desirable weavability, remarkable washability, low&#8208;temperature tolerance, and stable TE performance over 1000 bending/twisting cycles.&#160;A resulting TE fabric comprising 32 p&#8208;type legs achieves a power density of 60.1 &#181;W cm&#8722;2 at temperature difference of 50 K, surpassing most reported PEDOT:PSS&#8208;based fiber devices, and retains over 95% performance after various mechanical deformations. The developed fabric&#8208;integrated intelligent fever monitoring system (forehead/wrist/armpit) exhibits high sensitivity (alarm response &lt; 5&#160;s) and good repeatability (3&#8211;4.3 s response over 50 cycles) for low/high fever monitoring. Such composite TE fibers are anticipated to advance practical applications of wearable TE fabrics in body energy harvesting, personalized healthcare, and intelligent fitness monitoring.

A gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy is proposed to fundamentally break the long&#8208;standing compromise between piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and mechanical quality factor (Qm) in (K, Na)NbO3 ferroelectric ceramics. By creating a controlled compositional gradient of Cu2+ ions in soft (K, Na)NbO3 ceramics via solid&#8208;state diffusion sintering, a record&#8208;breaking combination of d33 = 350 pC/N and Qm = 340 is obtained, promising for high&#8208;power piezoelectric applications.








Abstract
Achieving a high piezoelectric coefficient (d33) and a high mechanical quality factor (Qm) simultaneously in ferroelectric ceramics has been a persistent challenge, as conventional doping strategies, i.e., donor doping and acceptor doping, inevitably sacrifice one for the other. Here, the inherent trade&#8208;off is breaking through a new gradient&#8208;acceptor&#8208;doping strategy. By judiciously introducing gradient Cu2+&#8208;acceptor ions in &#8220;soft&#8221; (K, Na)NbO3 (KNN) ceramics, a record combination of properties is achieved &#8212; a d33 of 350 pC/N and a Qm of 340,&#8212;the first co&#8208;elevation of both parameters exceeding 300 in KNN&#8208;based systems. This represents a fourfold improvement in Qm with only a 10% reduction in d33. Multi&#8208;scale structural analysis reveals that the gradient doping retains a &#8220;soft&#8221; interior for high d33, and creates a &#8220;hardened&#8221; surface layer that effectively restrains domain switching, accounting for the enhanced Qm. This work offers a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;power ferroelectric ceramics by spatially tailoring functional properties.

         <title>Thermally Switchable Photoactivity in Azobenzene&#8208;Functionalized DNA Condensates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA condensates formed by liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation of linear DNA nanomachines exhibit selective photo&#8208;responsive deformations according to temperature. At higher temperatures, the DNA condensates are in a liquid&#8208;like state and elongate under visible light, while at lower temperatures, the DNA condensates become more gel&#8208;like and elongate under UV light.








Abstract
Soft materials capable of responding to diverse environmental stimuli are fundamental to advancing soft robotics and intelligent biomedical devices, enabling adaptive, life&#8208;like functions. Here, multimodal photothermal adaptability is reported in azobenzene&#8208;conjugated DNA condensates assembled via liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS). These coacervates exhibit a striking temperature&#8208;dependent inversion of their photo&#8208;response: at elevated temperatures, the liquid&#8208;like droplets deform under visible light and dissolve under ultraviolet (UV) light, whereas at lower temperatures, the gel&#8208;like condensates are reshaped by UV light while remaining inert to visible light. This unique bidirectional control is attributed to the synergy of confined azobenzene photochemistry within DNA duplexes and a pronounced isomer&#8208;dependent shift in the system's glass transition and melting temperatures. This platform of multi&#8208;responsive photofluids opens new avenues for applications demanding exquisite spatiotemporal control.

         <title>Covalent Adaptable Network Enables Sustainable Polyethylene for Next&#8208;Generation Cable Insulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyethylene is post&#8208;functionalized through a copper&#8208;catalyzed C&#9472;H amination, and dynamic covalent chemistry is subsequently employed to construct a new dynamic cross&#8208;linked polyethylene insulation. The material maintains cable&#8208;level electrical and mechanical properties, enables thermal self&#8208;healing after electrical and mechanical damage, and shows good recyclability, making it suitable for sustainable power cable insulation applications.








Abstract
Cross&#8208;linked polyethylene (XLPE) with favorable electrical and mechanical properties is a key component of high voltage power transmission. However, damages caused by strong electrical and high mechanical stresses tend to initiate structural degradation of insulating materials, which in severe cases can lead to catastrophic failure of equipment. The irreversible curing property of XLPE presents significant challenges in self&#8208;healing after damage and recycling after decommissioning. Herein, an innovative strategy is developed that utilizes Cu&#8208;catalyzed amination to synthesize functionalized polyethylene, combined with dynamic covalent chemistry to prepare tailorable covalent adaptable networks (CANs). Due to the exchange of dual dynamic covalent bonds, the prepared CANs exhibit excellent self&#8208;healing and recycling properties, with performance recovery efficiency close to 100% after mechanical and electrical damage. Furthermore, the ingeniously designed structure of CANs, which combines &#8220;strong&#8221; permanent cross&#8208;linking with &#8220;weak&#8221; dynamic cross&#8208;linking, achieves a higher toughness of 102.0&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3 and excellent electrical insulation properties (electric field distortion rate of only 7% at 70&#160;&#176;C) than XLPE. This work promotes the environmental friendliness and long life of XLPE, paving the way for a new generation of sustainable cable insulation.

         <title>3D Bioprinted Human Synovium&#8208;Cartilage Models Mimic Rheumatoid Arthritis Microenvironment and Recapitulate In Vivo Therapeutic Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents human in vitro rheumatoid arthritis models using chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogels with fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes, pro&#8208;inflammatory macrophages, and protective barrier macrophages, closely recapitulating key rheumatoid arthritis pathological features. This model is validated by anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, and its transcriptomic and proteomic profiles are aligned with in vivo pathology, offering reliable platforms for preclinical drug screening.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) models play crucial roles in therapeutic discovery and fundamental research. However, current models have limited success at accurately simulating in vivo microenvironment and lacking intricate cellular cross&#8208;talk. Here, this work presents a human in vitro RA model that faithfully captures functional and compositional properties of cartilage and synovial lining in vivo, established with chondrocytes recellularized type II collagen scaffold and 3D&#8208;bioprinted bi&#8208;layered Gelatin&#8208;Matrigel hydrogel incorporating fibroblast&#8208;like synoviocytes (FLS) and proinflammatory macrophages in the top layer and protective barrier macrophages in the bottom layer. This synovium&#8208;cartilage system recapitulates key inflammatory processes akin to RA, including enhanced production of proinflammatory mediators and degradative enzymes, as well as reactive oxygen species generation, invasion of FLS into cartilage, phenotypic alterations of macrophages and the depletion of cartilaginous extracellular matrix components. The established model enables effective screening of anti&#8208;arthritis drugs, which is validated by leveraging celecoxib and tofacitinib. Furthermore, the transcriptomic and proteomic landscape of this model demonstrates accuracy in replicating in vivo pathological conditions. Notably, this in vitro model reflects the response of the disease to the drug compared to the rat model of RA. Overall, this study provides reliable in vitro human synovium&#8208;cartilage models for screening preclinical drugs in RA therapeutics.

         <title>Unfolding and Degradation of Micellar Immunodrug Carriers Derived From End Group Modified Aliphatic Poly(Carbonate)s with Acid&#8208;Responsive Ketal Side Groups</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;responsive polymeric micelle system based of aliphatic poly(carbonate)s with benzyl ketal side chains is designed for targeted immunodrug delivery. It can disassemble in endosomal environments, enabling site&#8208;specific immunoactivation and enhanced biodegradability. Covalent end group conjugation of a TLR7/8 agonist regulates immune cell activation and cytokine regulation, offering a promising platform for safer, more effective immunotherapeutics.








Abstract
Small&#8208;molecule immunodrugs hold significant promise for immunotherapeutic applications including vaccination and cancer therapy. However, their clinical use is limited by severe side effects resulting from systemic distribution. To address this challenge, a biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive nanocarrier system designed for controlled immunodrug delivery in vivo is presented. It is based on polymeric micelles that disassemble in response to acidic environments, enabling site&#8208;specific particle unfolding following endocytosis by antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Its core structure features a hydrolysable aliphatic poly(carbonate) backbone, promoting both biocompatibility and biodegradability. The high precision of the applied ring&#8208;opening polymerization allows for polymer end group functionalization, including the integration of fluorophores for F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based monitoring of particle integrity and unfolding. The observations reveal a pH&#8208;dependent disassembly profile both in vitro and in vivo. Comparative studies with non&#8208;responsive poly(carbonate)s demonstrate the superior performance of the acid&#8208;responsive design in selectively disassembling under acidic conditions and enhancing polymer backbone degradation. Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll&#8208;like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production. The findings underscore the potential of this biodegradable, acid&#8208;responsive micellar nanocarrier system as precision delivery platform for safer and effective immunotherapeutics.

Furthermore, covalent conjugation of a small molecule Toll-like receptor 7/8 agonist promotes its controlled delivery in vitro and in vivo, resulting in improved immune cell uptake and regulated cytokine production. The findings underscore the potential of this biodegradable, acid-responsive micellar nanocarrier system as precision delivery platform for safer and effective immunotherapeutics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Sulfone Molecular Switch Enables Direct Two&#8208;Electron Uranium Photoreduction in Programmed Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pioneers a &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221; in COFs that shifts the uranium photoreduction from an indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron pathway. This molecular&#8208;level strategy promotes exciton dissociation and charge separation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, as well as suppressed &#8226;O2&#8722; generation, establishing a new paradigm for controlling photocatalytic reactions.








Abstract
Photocatalytic uranium extraction from seawater is indispensable for sustainable nuclear energy, yet its efficiency is fundamentally limited by the prevailing indirect superoxide&#8208;mediated reduction pathway, which suffers from sluggish kinetics, oxygen dependency, and poor selectivity. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molecular&#8208;level &#8220;sulfone switch&#8221;, integrated into a covalent organic framework via edge&#8208;hanging engineering, orchestrates a decisive shift from the indirect to a direct two&#8208;electron transfer pathway for uranium photoreduction. The optimized Py&#8208;DaSO&#8208;COF achieves a remarkable uranium extraction capacity of 21.25&#160;mg g&#8722;1 in natural seawater, which is coupled with rapid kinetics and high selectivity against vanadium ions, surpassing most reported photocatalytic systems. Notably, combined experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the electron&#8208;deficient thiophene sulfone group promotes exciton dissociation, stabilizes key *UO2 intermediates, and suppresses &#8226;O2&#8722; generation by diverting electrons directly to adsorbed uranium species. This work establishes a versatile molecular engineering strategy for controlling photocatalytic pathways, highlighting its universal significance for solar&#8208;driven resource recovery and beyond.

         <title>Supramolecular Coupling Effect Enhanced Highly Transparent, Conductive Ionic Skin for Underwater Sensory and Interactive Robotics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Underwater ionogel&#8208;based electronics face a typical trade&#8208;off among conductivity, transparency and sensitivity. Herein, a hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel engineered is reported with tert&#8208;butyl groups, which exhibits high transparency (96.38%) and ion conductivity (1.74 mS cm&#8722;1) benefited by supramolecular interactions. By integrating into a suspended 3D morphing structure, the obtained ionogel can achieve an ultra&#8208;high pressure sensitivity of &#8776;2.9 Pa, enabling flow field perception and autonomous obstacle avoidance in underwater robots.








Abstract
Soft electronics based on polymeric gels with unique optical, mechanical and electrical properties are of crucial importance in marine resource exploration. Hydrophobic fluorinated ionogel that combines with optical transparency, flexibility and conductivity is considered a promising potential. However, current soft ionogels struggle to meet the requirements of high electrical conductivity, transparency and perception sensitivity in the aquatic environment. Herein, a novel fluorinated polymeric ionogel is developed incorporated with tert&#8208;butyl groups and hydrophobic ionic liquid. Benefiting from the strong supramolecular dipole interaction of fluorine atoms and the hydrogen bond of tert&#8208;butyl ester, this designed polymeric ionogel exhibits both high transparency (96.38%) and enhanced ion mobility (1.74 mS cm&#8722;1). To further achieve high sensitivity, a suspended 3D morphing mechanism is proposed to construct an underwater camouflage skin with ultra&#8208;high underwater sensitivity (&#8776;2.9&#160;Pa), which enables capturing flow field gradients, tracking biological motion, and precisely localizing disturbance sources. As a demo, the ionogel&#8208;based suspended underwater electronic device is integrated into a dolphin&#8208;inspired untethered robot and further showed the closed&#8208;loop control capability of danger perception, decision and autonomous avoidance, demonstrating significant promise in underwater bionic electronics and intelligent robotics.

         <title>Initiator&#8208;Free Supramolecular Zwitterionic Gels for Skin&#8208;Inspired Soft Iontronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An initiator&#8208;free supramolecular gelation technology has been developed to enable the spontaneous polymerization gelation of zwitterionic monomers via Lewis acid&#8208;base interactions. This approach biomimetically realizes a soft ionic material with ultra&#8208;low modulus and ultra&#8208;high conductivity, meanwhile achieving force&#8208;electricity decoupling for signal sensing and robot control applications at biological ionic interfaces.








Abstract
Conventional synthetic skin for intelligent soft robotics typically relies on thermally or UV&#8208;initiated polymerization, making initiator&#8208;free rapid gelation a persistent challenge. Here, a supramolecular Lewis acid&#8211;base gelation strategy that enables facile, initiator&#8208; and crosslinker&#8208;free synthesis of polyzwitterionic gels is presented. Strong hydrogen bonding between urea (hydrogen bond donor, HBD) and the zwitterionic moieties of 2&#8208;methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC; polymerizable zwitterionic hydrogen bond acceptor, PZHBA) drives spontaneous polymerization, establishing a general platform for zwitterionic gelation in deep eutectic solvents (DESs), such as choline chloride (ChCl) and urea. Inspired by the structural and ionic complexity of human skin, zwitterionic supramolecular eutectogel (ZSE) is designed via copolymerization of N&#8208;acryloyl glycinamide (NAGA) and MPC in DES, yielding a bioinspired ion&#8211;hydrogen bond dynamic network. These gels exhibit tunable mechanical properties, including an ultralow Young's modulus (5&#8211;180 kPa), and exceptionally high ionic conductivity (2 S&#183;m&#8722;1), which arises from the solvation of zwitterionic groups. The dynamic supramolecular network also imparts recyclability and intrinsic self&#8208;adhesion. ZSEs can be continuously spun into highly sensitive strain sensors with environmental robustness for integration into textiles. Additionally, bio&#8208;optimized gel patches demonstrate excellent antibacterial activity and biocompatibility. This work offers a sustainable and versatile synthetic platform for next&#8208;generation soft iontronics and bioinspired human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Regulating Membranes with Surface&#8208;Enriched Charge Networks Enabling Stable Zinc&#8208;Manganese Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ion&#8208;regulating membrane is designed with a surface&#8208;concentrated positively&#8208;charged Zn2&#8314; crosslinked network for zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries. The membrane effectively mitigates proton crossover and regulates zinc ion distribution to avoid dendrites, thus significantly improving areal capacity and prolonging the lifespan with a record accumulated capacity.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;based flow batteries are promising for sustainable energy storage owing to their high energy density and eco&#8208;friendliness. When coupling with Mn2+/MnO2 posolyte, the zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries promise an ultra&#8208;low electrolyte cost (0.0039 $ Ah&#8722;1). However, their practical application is limited by low areal capacity (&lt;20 mAh cm&#8722;2) and poor lifespan (&lt;100 cycles with accumulated capacity &lt; 2000 mAh cm&#8722;2), associated with proton crossover and zinc dendrite formation. To address the two bottlenecks, an ion&#8208;regulating membrane with surface&#8208;enriched positive charges of Zn2+ crosslinked networks is proposed. The enriched&#8208;charged networks amplify H&#8314; retention (60% elevated proton transport barrier to 0.104&#160;eV) via imposing charge&#8208;enhanced dehydration barriers and nitrogen&#8208;groups synergism, leveraging the higher ionic potential of protons to discriminate the conduction ions (K+). Simultaneously, the surface charges electrostatically guide the uniform distribution of near&#8208;electrode zinc ions for zinc&#8208;oriented growth without dendrites. The synergistic strategy achieves a near&#8208;neutral zinc&#8208;manganese flow system with a record accumulated capacity of 6510 mAh cm&#8722;2 (&gt;200 cycles) at 30&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, high areal capacity of 100 mAh cm&#8722;2 (130.1 mWh cm&#8722;2) at 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, representing one of the most stable zinc&#8208;manganese flow batteries reported. This study provides an effective membrane design strategy for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy&#8208;density zinc&#8208;based flow batteries.

         <title>Construction of Robust and Criss&#8208;Crossed LiOH Nanosheets on Lithium Metal Anodes for Stable Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface layer of uniform, ultrathin, robust, criss&#8208;crossed, and lithiophilic LiOH nanosheets is in situ constructed on Li metal anode by using a bond water chemistry in C2H8N2&#183;H2O. The LiOH interface layer can suppress the growth of Li dendrites and improve the stability of Li metal anode, resulting in a superior performance of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries.








Abstract
Metallic lithium (Li) is a promising anode for constructing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li metal batteries due to its low potential, high theoretical capacity, and low density. However, issues including high chemical reactivity, unstable solid electrolyte interface, and formation of Li dendrites impede its application. Herein, an interface layer of uniform, ultrathin, robust, criss&#8208;crossed, and lithiophilic LiOH nanosheets is in situ constructed on Li metal anode by a bond water chemistry in C2H8N2&#183;H2O. Li deposition happens below the LiOH layer due to its ultralow electrical conductivity and abundant ion channels, which protects Li metal anode from corrosion by liquid electrolyte. The robust (14 GPa) and criss&#8208;crossed LiOH nanosheets can physically suppress the growth of Li dendrites. The LiOH layer with lithiophilicity can homogenize Li+ flux distribution and reduce Li+ diffusion barrier on interface, promoting uniform Li deposition. Under the regulation of the multifunctional LiOH layer, issues of Li metal anode are relieved. When used in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries, the C2H8N2&#183;H2O modified Li (MLi) can withstand the attack of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs). Thus, the electrochemical performances of Li metal anodes and Li&#8211;S batteries are obviously improved. This study provides a new inspiration for the interface modification of Li metal anodes.

         <title>Toward Reprocessable High&#8208;Performance Elastomer: Self&#8208;Assembly, Dynamic Covalent Chemistry, and Tailorable Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High performance, reprocessability, and multifunctionality in elastomers can be achieved by integrating microphase self&#8208;assembly with dynamic covalent chemistry. This strategy underscores how network design enables mechanical robustness, recyclability, and multifunctionality, offering guidance for sustainable elastomer development in advanced applications such as tires, flexible electronics, and industrial materials.








Abstract
The development of elastomers that&#160;combine&#160;high&#160;performance&#160;with reprocessability is essential to meet extreme&#160;operational&#160;demands&#160;while addressing sustainability challenges. Polyurethane&#160;elastomers,&#160;as&#160;a&#160;representative class of high&#8208;performance elastomers, derive their exceptional toughness, flexibility, and durability from precisely engineered microphase&#8208;separated structures formed by self&#8208;assembly. Advances in characterization methodologies and molecular design strategies have enabled the optimization of static, dynamic, and stimuli&#8208;responsive properties, broadening their application in emerging fields. At the same time, reprocessability is achieved through dynamic covalent chemistry, which allows topological rearrangement of crosslinked networks without loss of integrity. Covalent adaptable networks provide a theoretical framework to link molecular exchange mechanisms with macroscopic viscoelasticity, self&#8208;healing, and processing behavior. Recent studies demonstrate that incorporating dynamic covalent chemistry into polyurethane elastomers and related elastomer systems enables closed&#8208;loop recycling and sustainable nanocomposite design while retaining mechanical robustness. This review highlights integrated strategies that bridge microphase engineering and dynamic network chemistry, and discusses opportunities and challenges in advancing high&#8208;performance, recyclable elastomers toward practical deployment.

         <title>Floating Epitaxy and Stitching Growth of Bilayer Organic Semiconductor Single Crystals on Polymer Dielectric Toward High&#8208;Performance and Ultra&#8208;Flexible Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Floating epitaxy and stitching growth method enables large&#8208;area growth of bilayer organic semiconductor single crystals on polymer dielectric. Surface&#8208;tension&#8208;controlled nucleation at the saturated solution&#8208;air interface reduces nucleation density and mitigates dielectric interference. The epitaxial&#160;crystals gradually stitch together, facilitating large&#8208;area crystals formation. Flexible organic filed&#8208;effect transistors based on these crystals&#160;retain the high performance even at ultralow bending radii.









Abstract
Bilayer organic semiconductor single crystals (OSSCs) have emerged as a highly promising material platform for the development of flexible organic electronic devices, owing to their exceptional mechanical flexibility and superior charge transport properties. However, in situ growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectric is greatly hindered by dielectric surface defects and strong molecular interaction between dielectric and organic semiconductor. Here, a floating epitaxy and stitching growth strategy is developed for large&#8208;area growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectric. By exploiting surface&#8208;tension&#8208;controlled nucleation behaviors of organic molecules, the preferential formation of organic seed crystals is achieved at saturated solution&#8208;air interface, thereby eliminating the adverse effects of polymer dielectric on nucleation and growth of OSSCs. Furthermore, the unique stitching growth mode of the crystals during epitaxial process ensures large&#8208;area bilayer OSSCs formation. Using this approach, we successfully fabricate sub&#8208;centimeter&#8208;sized bilayer 2,9&#8208;didecyldinaphtho[2,3&#8208;b:2&#8217;,3&#8217;&#8208;f]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene crystals on polymer dielectric. Notably, organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on the crystals retain a high carrier mobility up to 15.1 cm2/Vs even after undergoing 3000 bending cycles at an ultra&#8208;small bending radius of 40 &#181;m, outperforming most existing flexible OFETs. This work opens a new avenue for large&#8208;area growth of bilayer OSSCs on polymer dielectrics toward high&#8208;performance, ultra&#8208;flexible transistors.

         <title>Modulating Ultraviolet&#8208;Visible&#8208;Near Infrared Emission in Hybrid Metal Halides via ns2 Ion Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel method to modify hybrid metal halides via ns2 ion doping, enabling tunable broad&#8208;spectrum emission in a single matrix. Through lattice distortion engineering, broadband self&#8208;trapped exciton emission spanning the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR region is achieved with various degrees of lattice distortion. The optimized materials exhibit near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) of 99% at 588 nm and 93% at 420&#160;nm. Based on these highly efficient emitters, a high&#8208;performance white light device with a color rendering index (CRI) of 92.9 and correlated color temperature (CCT) of 6087 K is fabricated, and NIR imaging and multi&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting are demonstrated for multifunctional optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Tunable broad&#8208;spectrum luminescent materials covering the ultraviolet (UV), visible, and near infrared (NIR) regions are essential for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic technologies. However, conventional systems are often limited by inefficient UV emission and the inability to integrate multiple spectral components within a single material. Here, a design strategy that combines ns2&#8208;ion with controlled lattice distortion is introduced to overcome these challenges. Using 4,4&#8208;difluoropiperidine (DFPD) as the organic cation, a family of hybrid metal halide phosphors, [(DFPD)2MCl4&#183;H2O, M = Cd/Zn] doped with different ns2 ion (Sn2+, Pb2+, Sb3+, Bi3+, and Te4+) is synthesized. It is revealed that reduced lattice distortion correlates with enhanced photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), enabling broadband self&#8208;trapped exciton emission spanning the UV&#8211;vis&#8211;NIR range within a single host matrix. Leveraging the highly efficient UV emission of 2%&#160;Pb&#8208;doped (DFPD)2CdCl4&#183;H2O (PLQY: 93%), a high&#8208;performance white light emitter with a color rendering index of 92.9 and a correlated color temperature of 6087 K is demonstrated. The materials further exhibit promising functionality in NIR imaging and multi&#8208;level anti&#8208;counterfeiting. This work elucidates the interplay between lattice distortion and exciton dynamics in Cd/Zn&#8208;based hybrid metal halides, providing fundamental insights into their photophysics and establishing a versatile strategy for designing next&#8208;generation broadband multifunctional optoelectronic materials.

Well&#8208;defined colloidal nanocrystals are ideal model systems for investigating fundamental structure&#8208;property relationships in heterogeneous electrocatalysis, yet their catalytic behaviors are often complicated by the presence of surface ligands. This Review provides a roadmap for understanding the double&#8208;edged sword effect of surface ligands in nanocrystal electrocatalysis by holistically overviewing ligand removal strategies and tailoring of ligand&#8208;enabled favorable interfacial microenvironments.








Abstract
Colloidal nanocrystals with well&#8208;controlled sizes, shapes, and facets have found extensive applications in electrocatalysis as model catalysts for fundamental studies of structure&#8208;property relationships. Surface ligands are ubiquitously employed in nanocrystal synthesis and play a pivotal role in directing nanocrystal growth to realize precise morphology control, yet the influences of surface ligands on the electrocatalytic properties of nanocrystals remain to be better understood. Here, a survey and perspectives are presented on the double&#8208;edged sword effect of surface ligands in nanocrystal electrocatalysis. Surface ligands, depending on circumstances, can either be detrimental to electrocatalysis by poisoning nanocrystal surfaces or be beneficial for creating favorable interfacial microenvironments to synergistically boost electrocatalysis. First, an overview of the surface&#8208;ligand chemistry of colloidal nanocrystals is provided, followed by a discussion of the types and binding modes of surface ligands. Subsequently, several strategies for removing surface ligands from nanocrystals are introduced to yield either clean surfaces or ligand&#8208;derived carbon coatings suitable for certain electrocatalytic applications. Furthermore, strategies for creating ligand&#8208;enabled favorable interfacial microenvironments are discussed by tailoring nanocrystal&#8211;ligand interactions via ligand exchange/modification and by tailoring ligand&#8211;ligand interactions via nanocrystal/ligand assembly. Finally, the discussion concludes by highlighting future opportunities for in&#8208;depth mechanistic understanding and rational design of surface ligands on nanocrystals toward molecular&#8208;level control of electrocatalytic processes.

         <title>Effective Degradation of Wild&#8208;Type and Mutant EGFR Using Self&#8208;Assembling Peptide&#8208;Derived PROTAC Nanoparticles (NanoTACs) for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;assembling NanoTACs accumulate in tumors and engage EGFR with multivalent binding, driving rapid endocytosis and intracellular PROTAC release. Dual lysosomal and proteasomal degradation eliminates both membrane&#8208;bound and cytosolic EGFR, including mutant forms that confer resistance. This coordinated mechanism suppresses EGFR signaling, overcomes monoclonal antibody and tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance, and supports potent therapeutic activity in refractory tumors.








Abstract
Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)&#8208;targeted therapeutics, including monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), have achieved clinical success but are limited by drug resistance and off&#8208;target toxicity. Herein, self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;derived PROTAC nanoparticles (NanoTACs) engineered for effective degradation of both wild&#8208;type and mutant EGFR for cancer therapy is reported. The NanoTACs are constructed from three peptide components: EGFR&#8208;binding peptide (EHGAMEI), a self&#8208;assembling peptide linker (FF), and an E3 ligase recruiting peptide (ALAPYIP). Through the hydrophobic interaction and &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking, self&#8208;assembling peptide&#8208;derived PROTACs formed uniform spherical nanoparticles with an average diameter of 144&#160;nm under aqueous conditions. In vitro, NanoTACs effectively eliminated both wild&#8208;type and L858R/T790M&#8208;mutant EGFR in cancer cells through direct lysosomal degradation and PROTAC&#8208;driven proteasomal degradation. In vivo, NanoTACs exhibited 2.24&#8208;fold higher tumor&#8208;targeting efficiency than free EGFR&#8208;binding peptide via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and EGFR&#8208;mediated active targeting. In colon and lung tumor models, NanoTACs suppressed tumor growth by 88.3%, achieved 95% degradation of wild&#8208;type and 80% of mutant EGFR, and induced extensive apoptosis without systemic toxicity. These findings established NanoTACs as a promising EGFR&#8208;targeted platform to overcome drug resistance to mAbs and TKIs by enabling effective degradation of wild&#8208;type and mutant EGFR in heterogeneous cancers.

         <title>Nanoscale Confined Tribo&#8208;Ion&#8208;Photonics for Ultrahigh&#8208;Resolution Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, a nanoscale confined tribo&#8208;ion&#8208;photonic device has been proposed, which achieves ultrahigh spatial resolution through nanoscale&#8208;triboelectrification&#8208;tuned ion injection. The conductivity and photoluminescence intensity of the semiconductor can be modulated. The device exhibits excellent reversibility and a record&#8208;breaking spatial resolution of 42333 pixels per inch. On the basis, patterns with fine structure are successfully written and could be instantaneously read out.








Abstract
Interactive sensing displays with ultrahigh resolution are critically important for next&#8208;generation human&#8208;machine interfaces and near&#8208;eye display technologies, yet their development has been hindered by fabrication and material limitations. Here, a nanoscale confined tribo&#8208;ion&#8208;photonic device has been proposed, consisting of a counterion&#8208;electromigration&#8208;confined ion&#8208;gel, a poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene) (PBTTT) active layer, and an electrode, which achieves ultrahigh spatial resolution through nanoscale&#8208;triboelectrification&#8208;tuned ion injection. The electrical conductivity and photoluminescence intensity of the PBTTT layer can be precisely modulated by scan force, scan rate, scan cycles, and applied bias of the atomic microscopy tip. The device exhibits excellent reversibility and a record&#8208;breaking spatial resolution of 42333 pixels per inch. On the basis, patterns with fine structure are successfully written and stored in the device and can be instantaneously read out due to the electrochromic phenomenon even under ambient lighting conditions. This work established a novel approach to ultrahigh&#8208;resolution imaging by combining triboelectricity with organic semiconductor devices, opening new possibilities for applications in visualized tactile imaging, polymer&#8208;based nano&#8208;optoelectronics, and nano&#8208;opto&#8208;electro&#8208;mechanical systems.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Switching Modulates Lewis Acidity in Ferrihydrite for Enhanced Phosphate Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative strategy is proposed to modulate Lewis acidity by switching high&#8208;spin (HS) Fe3+ to activate t2g&#8594;eg orbital electron transitions, which significantly enhances both adsorption activity and selectivity. Advanced diagnostic tools illustrate this dynamic relationships: spin&#8208;state regulation &#8594; Lewis acidity evolution &#8594; adsorption efficiency. These findings pave the way for designing advanced adsorbents targeting Lewis basic pollutants.








Abstract
Iron&#8208;based adsorbents are promising candidates for phosphorus removal, whereas the current progress suffers from the effectiveness of their Lewis acid sites. Herein, an innovative strategy is proposed to modulates Lewis acidity by switching high&#8208;spin (HS) Fe3+ to activate t2g&#8594;eg orbital electron transitions. Results demonstrate that the weak field ligand effect of sulfur (S) reduces the orbital splitting energy in ferrihydrite (Fh), inducing the generation of HS Fe3+ (eg filling &#8776;0.983). Compared to pristine Fh, the HS S&#8208;Fh exhibits an elevated number of unpaired d electrons (2.36&#8594;3.45), thereby significantly increasing its Lewis acidity. Mechanistic studies reveal that improved electron transfer between P&#8211;O bonds and Fe centers, together with strengthened d&#8211;p orbital hybridization, promotes phosphate adsorption, resulting in a 146&#8208;fold improvement in adsorption kinetics. Remarkably, S&#8208;Fh continuous&#8208;flow reactor maintains &#8776;100% phosphate removal after treating over 1200 bed volumes of wastewater. This work emphasizes the crucial role of spin state in regulating Lewis acidity and provides a new design strategy for highly efficient adsorbents.

         <title>Twisting van der Waals Heterostructures Enables Thermographic In&#8208;Sensor Computing and Logics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bioinspired twisted graphene/TiSe2 heterostructures enable wide&#8208;range thermal perception (20&#8211;350 K). Integrated into a 64 &#215; 64 array with CNN, they enhance thermal imaging accuracy by 46% and achieve 99% pathological cell classification, while demonstrating in&#8208;sensor logic operations toward intelligent machine vision.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing and logics are the core for advancing machine vision technology, but face challenges in extending such capability into thermal form. Here, a bioinspired thermoreceptor array based on twisted graphene and titanium diselenide (TiSe2) heterostructures is presented. The electron&#8208;phonon interaction between graphene and few&#8208;layer TiSe2 exhibits strong twist&#8208;angle (&#952;) dependence, as evidenced by varied phonon&#8208;induced gap of graphene (114 &#177; 13 meV for &#952; = 1&#176; and 67 &#177; 6 meV for &#952; = 7&#176;), enabling sensitive thermal reception at temperature range from 20 to 350 K. Integrating such heterostructure into a (64 &#215; 64) thermoperception array with a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework promotes significant advancements in microscopic thermal imaging, enhancing thermal image detection accuracy by 46% and achieving 99% classification accuracy for pathological cell identification. In addition, the &#8220;AND&#8221; &#8220;OR&#8221;, and,&#8220;AND/OR&#8221; logic operations are demonstrated using these thermoreceptor arrays. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept thermoperception arrays also simplify the monolithically integrable architecture of machine vision and offer a potential solution for efficient in&#8208;sensor computing and logics for next&#8208;generation intelligent systems.

Here, a bioinspired thermoreceptor array based on twisted graphene and titanium diselenide (TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) heterostructures is presented. The electron-phonon interaction between graphene and few-layer TiSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits strong twist-angle (&lt;i&gt;&#952;&lt;/i&gt;) dependence, as evidenced by varied phonon-induced gap of graphene (114 &#177; 13 meV for &lt;i&gt;&#952; =&lt;/i&gt; 1&#176; and 67 &#177; 6 meV for &lt;i&gt;&#952; =&lt;/i&gt; 7&#176;), enabling sensitive thermal reception at temperature range from 20 to 350 K. Integrating such heterostructure into a (64 &#215; 64) thermoperception array with a convolutional neural network (CNN) framework promotes significant advancements in microscopic thermal imaging, enhancing thermal image detection accuracy by 46% and achieving 99% classification accuracy for pathological cell identification. In addition, the &#8220;AND&#8221; &#8220;OR&#8221;, and,&#8220;AND/OR&#8221; logic operations are demonstrated using these thermoreceptor arrays. This proof-of-concept thermoperception arrays also simplify the monolithically integrable architecture of machine vision and offer a potential solution for efficient in-sensor computing and logics for next-generation intelligent systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Dual&#8208;Conduction Polymer Electrolyte and Stable Interphase Engineering for Room&#8208;/Subzero&#8208;Temperature, Long&#8208;Cycling All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;conduction polymer electrolyte, coupled with a stable artificial interphase, is engineered to enable long&#8208;cycle all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries. This designed electrolyte facilitates rapid ion transport, while the hybrid interphase effectively suppresses side reactions and dendrite growth, resulting in an exceptional 91.2% capacity retention over 1000 cycles at 2 C, demonstrating the success of our design.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium batteries (ASSSBs) are promising due to their exceptional energy density, safety, and abundant sodium resources. Poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) electrolyte is extensively investigated for ASSSBs, but its practical application is limited by low ionic conductivity and interfacial instability at room/sub&#8209;zero temperatures. Here, a dual&#8208;strategy solid&#8208;state electrolyte design (entirely liquid&#8208;free) is presented in which succinonitrile serves as a plasticizer that synergizes with PEO, creating dual&#8208;ion conduction pathways that achieve an impressive ionic conductivity of 2.75 &#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. Concurrently, sodium difluoro(oxalate)borate undergoes in situ reactions with sodium metal anode, synergizing with the artificially formed NaF interphase layer to facilitate the successful formation of a stable, inorganic salt&#8208;rich solid electrolyte interphase. This mechanism effectively suppresses undesirable side reactions between the polymer and sodium metal anode. Consequently, Na@NaF||Na@NaF symmetric cells exhibit outstanding cycling stability for over 1,500 hours at 0.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under room temperature. Full cells based on Na3V2(PO4)3||Na@NaF retain 91.2% of their initial capacity after 1,000 cycles at 2C. Notably, the ASSSBs deliver a discharge capacity of 88.2&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 even at &#8722;5&#160;&#176;C, highlighting their suitability for low&#8208;temperature applications. This work establishes an electrolyte&#8208;interface collaborative design paradigm for high&#8208;performance ASSSBs under wide&#8208;temperature operating conditions.

         <title>Reprogramming mRNA Delivery Tropism via Nitrogen&#8208;To&#8208;Sulfur Substitution in Ionizable Lipids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfonium lipid S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 is created by replacing the nitrogen in the head of ALC&#8208;0315 with sulfur. This seemingly slight but crucial modification provides S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 with a distinct ability to achieve lung targeting, while the introduction of S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 into LNPs containing ALC&#8208;0315 is capable of selectively delivering mRNA to dendritic cells in the spleen, thereby achieving a robust anti&#8208;tumor effect.








Abstract
Ionizable lipids serve as critical determinants for mRNA therapeutics. While clinically approved lipids like ALC&#8208;0315 demonstrate robust hepatic tropism, their inherent liver&#8208;targeting bias substantially limits therapeutic applications requiring extrahepatic delivery. Furthermore, the complex safety validation requirements for novel lipid architectures present significant barriers to clinical translation. Hence, a simple nitrogen&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur (N&#8208;to&#8208;S) switching strategy is proposed in the head group of marketed vectors to modulate the tissue distribution of LNP&#8208;mRNA. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept studies with ALC&#8208;0315&#8208;derived S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 reveal that this atomic&#8208;level modification fundamentally redirected delivery tropism from hepatic to pulmonary tissues. Notably, formulation optimization demonstrates that combining S&#8208;ALC&#8208;0315 with its parent lipid at a 1:2 molar ratio generated LNPs with spleen targeting. Consequently, this method promotes the generation of antigen&#8208;specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), and has produced significant anti&#8208;tumor effects in two tumor models while maintaining safety. This research underscores the N&#8208;to&#8208;S lipid modification as a promising platform for tailoring organ targeting and accelerating clinical translation.

         <title>Electrical Catalysis of Forbidden Transitions in Single&#8208;Molecule Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A chemical reaction that is typically symmetry&#8208;forbidden (norbornadiene (NBD) to quadricyclane (QC)) is catalyzed in a single&#8208;molecule junction using a combination of nanoconfinement and electrical catalysis. It occurs when the molecular junction is sterically driven into a configuration that is far from the ground state prior to applying the activating voltage as revealed by simultaneous single&#8208;molecule break&#8208;junction and Raman spectroscopy.








Abstract
Molecular orbital symmetry plays a pivotal role in determining chemical reaction mechanisms. The process of changing chemical reactants into products must transition along a pathway that conserves molecular orbital symmetry to ensure continuity. This principle is so fundamental that reactions that do not conserve symmetry are typically considered &#8220;forbidden&#8221; due to the high resultant energy barriers. Here, it is demonstrated that it is possible to electrically catalyze these forbidden transitions when a single molecule is bound between two electrodes in a nanoscale junction. A cycloaddition reaction is induced in a norbornadiene (NBD) derivative, converting it to quadricyclane (QC) by utilizing nanoconfinement to place the molecule into a configuration that is far from equilibrium and applying a small voltage to the molecular junction. Traditionally, this reaction can only be induced photochemically due to orbital symmetry selection rules. By directly tracking the reaction dynamics in situ using single&#8208;molecule Raman spectroscopy, it is shown that for this reaction to be electrically catalyzed the molecule must be sterically maneuvered into a configuration near the transition state at the peak of the energy barrier prior to applying the voltage needed to successfully induce the forbidden transition is applied.

         <title>Designing Physical Unclonable Functions From Optically Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non&#8208;invasive, and non&#8208;destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non&#8208;resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PUF devices is examined using non&#8208;deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next&#8208;generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.

Abstract
The field of nanophotonics has seen remarkable advances, with gold&#8208;based materials standing out. By precisely fine&#8208;tuning the size and shape of metal nanoparticles (NPs), such as gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), it has been possible to gain control over light interaction, modulating localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR), a phenomenon that involves the collective oscillation of free conduction electrons.

When AuNPs dimensions fall below 2 nm, they become gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), losing the LSPR but acquitting fluorescence due to their molecule&#8208;like behavior. This unique feature makes them ideal for high&#8208;resolution imaging, biomarker detection, and advanced therapies. Beyond traditional uses, the recent inclusion of AuNPs into nanomotors (NMs) enhances precise in vivo tracking and targeted drug delivery. This review highlights the different applications of plasmonic nanomaterials with particular emphasis on AuNPs and AuNCs as a function of their shapes, sizes, and stabilization ligands. Moreover, it dives into the biosensing applications of plasmonic materials by addressing their so&#8208;called far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field optical properties, giving a detailed overview of different high&#8208;sensitivity immunoassays and biosensing.

         <title>Unperceivable Designs of Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unperceivable wearable technologies seamlessly integrate into everyone's daily life, for healthcare and Internet&#8208;of&#8208;Things applications. By remaining completely unnoticed both visually and tactilely, by the user and others, they ensure medical privacy and allow natural social interactions. Herein are introduced recent strategies employed at material, design, and integration levels to reach unperceivable technologies, whether through transparent materials or strategically hidden devices.








Abstract
Wearable smart electronics are taking an increasing part of the consumer electronics market, with applications in advanced healthcare systems, entertainment, and Internet of Things. The advanced development of flexible, stretchable, and breathable electronic materials has paved the way to comfortable and long&#8208;term wearables. However, these devices can affect the wearer's appearance and draw attention during use, which may impact the wearer's confidence and social interactions, making them difficult to wear on a daily basis. Apart from comfort, one key condition for user acceptance is that these new technologies seamlessly integrate into our daily lives, remaining unperceivable to others. In this review, strategies to minimize the visual impact of wearable devices and make them more suitable for daily use are discussed. These new devices focus on being unperceivable when worn and comfortable enough that users almost forget their presence, reducing psychological discomfort while maintaining accuracy in signal collection. Materials selection is crucial for developing long&#8208;term and unperceivable wearable devices. Recent developments in these unperceivable electronic devices are also covered, including sensors, transistors, and displays, and mechanisms to achieve unperceivability are discussed. Finally, the potential applications are summarized and the remaining challenges and prospects are discussed.

         <title>Selective Lipolysis by Photoactivation of Chaperone&#8208;Mediated Autophagy Using Adipocyte Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticle in Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles loaded with rosiglitazone in hydrogel offer an alternative approach to conventional obesity treatments. This system selectively targets adipocytes, inducing lipolysis by activating chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy through mild photothermal stimulation. Demonstrating significant weight loss in animal models, this nanomaterial&#8208;based strategy holds promise for obesity management and other autophagy&#8208;related disorders.








Abstract
Despite the clinical importance of obesity, treatments have been confined to surgery or drugs, both of which carry adverse effects. Herein a nanomaterial consisting of adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles embedded in hydrogel (ARNP&#8208;H) is designed aiming to induce selective lipolysis in adipocyte through activation of chaperone&#8208;mediated autophagy (CMA) by mild photothermal heat stress. Adipocyte membrane&#8208;coated and rosiglitazone&#8208;loaded polydopamine nanoparticles (ARNP) are taken up by adipocyte to a significantly greater extent than other cell membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles. Adipocyte interactions with ARNP are significantly higher than those with other cells such as macrophages and T cells. ARNP&#8208;H enabled selective activation of CMA in adipocytes, increasing levels of heat shock cognate protein 70, a key component of CMA. Colocalization of heat shock cognate protein 70 and breakdown of CMA substrate perilipin 2, led to enhancement of adipose triglyceride lipase access to lipid droplets, initiating lipolysis. In high&#8208;fat diet&#8208;fed mice, ARNP&#8208;H retention at the local injection site is greater than in other groups, maintaining photothermal responsiveness for over 3 days. ARNP&#8208;H treatment significantly enhanced adipocyte lipolysis and led to substantial weight loss. While this study focuses on obesity model, ARNP&#8208;H for CMA photoactivation holds potential for treating other diseases associated with autophagy dysregulation.

         <title>Wideband Tuning and Deep&#8208;Tissue Spectral Detection of Indium Phosphide Nano&#8208;Laser Particles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces indium phosphide (InP) nanolaser particles operating in the near&#8208;infrared&#8208;I (NIR&#8208;I) spectrum, with ultrawide tunability (740&#8211;970&#160;nm) and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidths. Optimized for deep&#8208;tissue imaging and multiplexed barcoding, these particles offer excellent stability, high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratios in scattering media, and biocompatibility, making them highly promising for advanced biomedical research and applications.








Abstract
Laser particles (LPs) emitting narrowband spectra across wide spectral ranges are highly promising for high&#8208;multiplex optical barcoding of biological cells. Here, LPs based on indium phosphide (InP) nanodisks are presented, operating in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range of 740&#8211;970&#160;nm. Utilizing low&#8208;order whispering gallery resonance modes in size&#8208;tuned nanodisks, an ultrawide color palette with 25% spectral utilization and nanometer&#8208;scale linewidth is achieved. A simple theoretical model accurately predicts spectral ranges based on particle size. The minimum laser size is 430&#160;nm in air and 560&#160;nm within cells, operating at mode orders of 4 or 5. The high brightness and narrow linewidths of polymer&#8208;silica&#8208;protected InP LPs, combined with a silicon&#8208;detector spectrometer, enable spectral detection of laser peaks with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratios in highly&#8208;scattering media, including 1&#8208;cm&#8208;thick chicken breast tissue and blood vessels in live mice.

         <title>Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Mechanoresponsive Color&#8208;Changing Hydrogels for Vision&#8208;Based Tactile Robots</title>

         <dc:description>
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can reversibly and resiliently change color in response to stress are highly desirable for diverse technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. This work reports a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress, for tactile robots by translating tactile sensations into visual images.









Abstract
Mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials that can&#160;reversibly&#160;and resiliently change color in response to mechanical deformation are highly desirable for diverse modern technologies in optics, sensors, and robots; however, such materials are rarely achieved. Here, a fatigue&#8208;resistant mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing hydrogel (FMCH) is reported that exhibits reversible, resilient, and predictable color changes under mechanical stress. At its undeformed state, the FMCH remains dark under a circular polariscope; upon uniaxial stretching of up to six times its initial length, it gradually shifts its color from black, to gray, yellow, and purple. Unlike traditional mechanoresponsive color&#8208;changing materials, FMCH maintains its performance across various strain rates for up to 10 000 cycles. Moreover, FMCH demonstrates superior mechanical properties with fracture toughness of 3000 J m&#8722;2, stretchability of 6, and fatigue threshold up to 400 J m&#8722;2. These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color&#8208;changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision&#8208;based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.

These exceptional mechanical and optical features are attributed to FMCH's substantial molecular entanglements and desirable hygroscopic salts, which synergistically enhance its mechanical toughness while preserving its color-changing performance. One application of this FMCH as a tactile sensoris then demonstrated for vision-based tactile robots, enabling them to discern material stiffness, object shape, spatial location, and applied pressure by translating stress distribution on the contact surface into discernible images.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multifunctional Neural Probes Enable Bidirectional Electrical, Optical, and Chemical Recording and Stimulation In Vivo</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Convergence drawing is used to create flexible, microscale, multifunctional fiber&#8208;based neural probes. Optimized materials selection enables individual devices to perform neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, fluid delivery, and voltammetric neurotransmitter detection in rodents. These bidirectional tools may permit multimodal interrogation of neural signaling across multiple brain regions in mechanistic and translational studies.








Abstract
Recording and modulation of neuronal activity enables the study of brain function in health and disease. While translational neuroscience relies on electrical recording and modulation techniques, mechanistic studies in rodent models leverage genetic precision of optical methods, such as optogenetics and fluorescent indicator imaging. In addition to electrical signal transduction, neurons produce and receive diverse chemical signals which motivate tools to probe and modulate neurochemistry. Although the past decade has delivered a wealth of technologies for electrophysiology, optogenetics, chemical sensing, and optical recording, combining these modalities within a single platform remains challenging. This work leverages materials selection and convergence fiber drawing to permit neural recording, electrical stimulation, optogenetics, fiber photometry, drug and gene delivery, and voltammetric recording of neurotransmitters within individual fibers. Composed of polymers and non&#8208;magnetic carbon&#8208;based conductors, these fibers are compatible with magnetic resonance imaging, enabling concurrent stimulation and whole&#8208;brain monitoring. Their utility is demonstrated in studies of the mesolimbic reward pathway by interfacing with the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens in mice and characterizing the neurophysiological effects of a stimulant drug. This study highlights the potential of these fibers to probe electrical, optical, and chemical signaling across multiple brain regions in both mechanistic and translational studies.

         <title>Deeply Implantable, Shape&#8208;Morphing, 3D MicroLEDs for Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work is deeply implantable, shape&#8208;morphing 3D microLEDs (SMLED) for mPDT, tailored to solid pancreatic tumor models with irregular and dynamically changing sizes. The device, based on a shape morphing, enables tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation. This approach results in significant PDAC volume reduction and modifications within the tumor microenvironment without adverse effects on surrounding tissues. This work represents a promising advancement in anticancer phototherapy, offering a safe, adaptable, and targeted approach for mPDT that can adjust to tumor volume changes.








Abstract
Controlled photooxidation&#8208;mediated disruption of collagens in the tumor microenvironment can reduce desmoplasia and enhance immune responsiveness. However, achieving effective light delivery to solid tumors, particularly those with dynamic volumetric changes like pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), remains challenging and limits the repeated and sustained photoactivation of drugs. Here, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing, implantable photonic devices (IPDs) are introduced that enable tumor&#8208;specific and continuous light irradiation for effective metronomic photodynamic therapy (mPDT). This IPD adheres seamlessly to the surface of orthotopic PDAC tumors, mitigating issues related to mechanical mismatch, delamination, and internal lesions. In freely moving mouse models, mPDT using the IPD with close adhesion significantly reduces desmoplastic tumor volume without causing cytotoxic effects in healthy tissues. These promising in vivo results underscore the potential of an adaptable and unidirectional IPD design in precisely targeting cancerous organs, suggesting a meaningful advance in light&#8208;based therapeutic technologies.

         <title>Robust Full&#8208;Surface Bonding of Substrate and Electrode for Ultra&#8208;Flexible Sensor Integration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A direct hybrid bonding method that enables both gold and parylene bonding without adhesives is developed. This technique achieves full&#8208;surface direct bonding of electrodes and substrates in flexible electronic connections. The method offers high flexibility, stable mechanical durability, and high&#8208;resolution interconnections, accommodating varying electrode shapes and sizes in flexible electronic applications.








Abstract
The integration of multiple flexible electronics is crucial for the development of ultra&#8208;flexible wearable and implantable devices. To fabricate an integrated system, robust and flexible bonding throughout the connection area, irrespective of the electrode or substrate, is needed. Conventional methods for flexible direct bonding have primarily been confined to metal electrodes or substrate&#8208;only bonding due to varying material properties. Consequently, the mechanical and electrical properties of the connections deteriorate based on their shape and size. This study introduces a bonding technique for wearable electronics, achieving strong, flexible connections between materials like gold and parylene at a low temperature (85&#160;&#176;C). This hybrid direct bonding method ensures strong bonding across both the Au electrode and parylene substrate within electronic interconnections. Additionally, a 3D&#8208;stacked flexible structure that maintains robustness and high flexibility without an adhesive layer is successfully developed. An ultrathin photoplethysmography sensor developed by stacking an ultrathin organic photodetector atop an organic light&#8208;emitting diode is demonstrated. Unlike traditional methods requiring adhesives or high pressure, this approach maintains flexibility essential for deformation, withstanding bending at a radius of 0.5&#160;mm. The technique's robustness suggests promising applications in durable, ultra&#8208;flexible electronics integration.

         <title>Upconversion Nanoparticle&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Core&#8211;shell Particles as Therapeutic Microrobots Trackable With Optoacoustic Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 49, December 10, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework core&#8211;shell particles provide enhanced contrast for optoacoustic imaging by leveraging the optical absorption of upconversion luminescence within the covalent organic framework matrix. Beyond their role as contrast agents, these particles enable customizable therapeutic agent loading and release, as well as magnetic microrobotic steering within vascular environments.








Abstract
Despite the development of various medical imaging contrast agents, integrating contrast signal generation with therapeutic and microrobotic functions remains challenging without complicated fabrication processes. In this study, upconversion nanoparticle&#8208;covalent organic framework (UCNP&#8208;COF) core&#8211;shell sub&#8208;micron particles are developed that function as therapeutic microrobots trackable with multi&#8208;spectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) imaging and can be loaded with desired therapeutic molecular agents in a customizable manner. The mechanism of optoacoustic signal generation in UCNP&#8208;COF particles is attributed to the quenching of upconversion luminescence emitted by the UCNPs, which is absorbed by the encapsulating COF and subsequently converted into acoustic waves. Unlike other microparticulate agents previously imaged with MSOT, UCNP&#8208;COF particles do not pose concerns about their stability and biocompatibility. Simultaneously, the mesoporous texture of the COF provides a large surface area, allowing for the efficient loading of various drug molecules, which can be released at target sites. Furthermore, the magnetic UCNP&#8208;COF Janus particles can be magnetically navigated through in vivo vasculature while being visualized in real&#8208;time with volumetric MSOT. This study proposes an approach to design photonic materials with multifunctionality, enabling high&#8208;performance medical imaging, drug delivery, and microrobotic manipulation toward their future potential clinical use.

This Perspective covers photonic nanomaterials and devices currently used in photobiomodulation and optogenetics for digitally controlled neurostimulation, providing the potential for neuro&#8208;immune interactions.








Abstract
The nervous and immune systems are closely interconnected, and influence the onset and progress of various diseases. Accordingly, understanding the interaction of the neural system and the immune system becomes very important for the treatment of intractable diseases with the analysis of therapeutic mechanisms, such as autoimmune diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, cancers, and so on. The conventional immunomodulation treatments have been mainly carried out by drug administration, but they have suffered from systemic negative side&#8208;effects with only limited effects on the specific disease. In this Perspective, photonic nanomaterials and devices are reviewed and discussed for digitally controlled neurostimulating photomedicine via photobiomodulation and optogenetics from the unique viewpoint of neuro&#8208;immune cross&#8208;talks. The prospects and perspectives to integrate photonic nanomaterials with advanced wearable and implantable healthcare devices are also provided and highlighted to revolutionize the therapeutic strategies by the interaction of neural and immune systems, and optimize the treatment protocols for futuristic digital photomedicine. This approach will revolutionize the fields of neurostimulation and immune regulation for further clinical applications.

         <title>Asymmetry of the Ferroelectric Phase Transition in BaTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase transitions are typically assumed to behave identically in forward and reverse. This work shows that in the ferroelectric material barium titanate this is not true: heating drives an abrupt, first&#8208;order jump, while cooling gives a smooth, continuous change. This surprising asymmetry challenges standard classifications of phase transitions and opens new strategies to design novel energy&#8208;storage devices.








Abstract
Symmetry changes during phase transformations fundamentally determine the behavior of thermodynamic systems, governing phenomena as diverse as water evaporation, fermion condensation, and epidemic spreading. Phase transitions are conventionally divided into two classes, and this classification is typically assumed to remain invariant upon reversing the transition. Here, an asymmetric phase transformation is uncovered in the ferroelectric&#8211;paraelectric transition of single&#8208;crystal BaTiO3, a model system for first&#8208;order transitions. Under slow temperature variation (&#8804;0.1&#160;&#176;C min&#8722;1), thermodynamic, dielectric, and domain&#8208;structure measurements reveal that the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric transition exhibits latent heat, phase coexistence, and a discontinuous order parameter, while these signatures are absent upon cooling. Complementary phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate similar behavior, attributing it to distinct elastic strain energy accumulation and release during heating and cooling. These findings reveal a first&#8208;order character upon heating but a second&#8208;order&#8208;like behavior upon cooling, challenging the conventional paradigm of symmetric phase&#8208;transition classification and suggesting new possibilities for ferroelectric&#8208;based&#160;energy&#160;storage.

         <title>Arresting Microphase Separation Encodes Material Mechanics by Sculpting Microarchitectures and Local Polymer Enrichment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microarchitecture sculpting via phase separation programs hydrogel mechanics by creating globular, inverse globular, and spinodal structures. Spinodal architectures deliver superior toughness and energy dissipation, while ionic modulation through single polymer phase separation offers a simple, scalable route to tune mechanical properties, complementing ATPS for diverse applications.








Abstract
Mechanical properties are central to material functionality. Although aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS) can generate microarchitectures in soft materials such as hydrogels, their influence on mechanics, particularly toughness and energy dissipation, remains poorly understood. Here, diverse microarchitectures are systematically engineered within materials via ATPS&#8208;induced local polymer enrichment, which yielding inverse globular, globular, and spinodal patterns, and revealing that each microarchitecture exhibits distinct mechanical behaviors. Most notably, spinodal hydrogel designs improve load distribution, increase fracture resistance, and promote efficient energy dissipation. These insights are used to develop and introduce single polymer phase separation (SPPS) as an innovative strategy to sculpt microarchitectures by tuning the ionic concentration, which overcomes traditional limitations of dual polymer systems. This novel approach enables scalable, low&#8208;complexity, and chemically clean control over stiffness, toughness, and energy dissipation, independent of secondary polymers. Beyond mechanical advantages, spinodal architectures also support enhanced cell migration and biological activity. These findings demonstrate that microarchitectural design, rather than total polymer composition alone, dictates hydrogel mechanics. ATPS and SPPS provide robust and scalable methods to encode distinct mechanical and functional properties via microarchitecture variations into hydrogels, opening opportunities across tissue engineering, biofabrication, soft electronics, and food engineering.

         <title>On&#8208;Demand Thermal Transport Modulation with Photoactive Nanofluid</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A suspension of photoactive titanium dioxide particles in a redox shuttle solution forms a light&#8208;responsive active fluid. Photochemical reactions induce convection in this fluid, enhancing thermal transport by over 100% as shown by experiments and simulations. This innovative fluid allows for precise local temperature control, promoting advancements in thermal management for miniaturized thermal devices.








Abstract
Efficient thermal management is at the core of energy generation and is crucial for modern high&#8208;performance electronics. Nanofluids, consisting of metal or inorganic nanoparticles suspended in a base fluid, can significantly enhance thermal transport performance, which is extensively studied for decades. On the other hand, with the growing need for thermal management, it will be desirable to access novel materials with in situ tunable thermal conductivity, allowing programmable delivery of thermal energy on demand. Here, a new type of thermal management material is demonstrated, a photoactive nanofluid, consisting of self&#8208;propelling active colloids suspended in a base fluid, where the overall thermal conductivity can be finely controlled through a light&#8208;driven chemical reaction. In particular, it is demonstrated that the active nanofluid, formulated with light&#8208;propelled colloids, can induce strong local convection, which not only prevents particle sedimentation but also enhances the overall heat transfer by over 100%, thereby allowing for on&#8208;demand thermal transport modulation with localized illumination.

         <title>Multi&#8208;scale Engineered Vasculature and Hierarchical Porosity via Volumetric Bioprinting&#8208;Guided Photopolymerization&#8208;Induced Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Vascularization in bioprinted hydrogels is limited by nanoscale porosity in hydrogel bionks. Volumetric bioprinting of gelatin&#8211;norbornene phase&#8208;separating hydrogels permits to create centimeter&#8208;scale constructs featuring interconnected multi&#8208;scale porosity. Light dose gradients result in spatially controlled pore dimensions. Capillary&#8208;scale vessels are grown from bioprinted endothelial cells, and printed channels can be perfused, enabling the biofabrication of perfusable tissue models.








Abstract
Vascularization remains a major challenge in hydrogel&#8208;based engineered tissues due to the inherent nano&#8208;scale porosity of common synthetic and natural biomaterials. Critically, the confinement imposed by nanoscale networks inhibits blood vessels outgrowth, required for oxygen and nutrient delivery. Despite advancements in the biofabrication of small channels (0.1&#8211;1 mm), achieving vascularization (with capillaries down to 10 &#181;m) throughout cm&#8208;scale bioprinted constructs remains a critical bottleneck. Herein, phase separating is integrated, cell&#8211;interactive gelatin&#8211;norbornene hydrogels with volumetric bioprinting to generate architecturally defined centimeter&#8208;scale constructs with 0.1&#8211;1mm scale printed channels and interpenetrating micron&#8208;scale porosity. This novel approach produced freeform construct designs with light&#8208;controllable micron&#8208;scale and hierarchical porosity. Importantly, this porosity enabled endothelial cell infiltration and microvessel outgrowth deep into the engineered tissue. Vascular structures formed in the pore spaces with feature sizes on the scale of capillaries (&lt;10 &#181;m), crucial to provide oxygen and nutrients to all regions of the hydrogel. The networks remained stable for over 14 days, outperforming classical nanoporous biomaterials. Vascular networks are perfusable in this custom&#8208;made bioreactor system and exhibited extended vessel outgrowth under perfused culture conditions. These complex hydrogel&#8208;based constructs with engineered multi&#8208;scale vascular networks have potential for generating actively perfusable advanced tissue models.

Lattice&#8208;reconstructed Ru&#8208;clusters on FeOOH&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisomes (LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH) have been designed for programmed reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation in treating infectious and inflammatory chronic wounds. These studies demonstrate that this LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH displays pH&#8208;switchable ROS&#8208;catalytic behaviors, which demonstrate coordinated antibacterial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;angiogenic functions, enabling a logically sequenced therapeutic progression from infection control to inflammation resolution and ultimately tissue regeneration.








Abstract
Chronic refractory wounds present substantial clinical difficulties, owing to their complex wound microenvironments featuring bacterial colonization, sustained inflammation, and deficient angiogenesis. Existing treatment options often fall short of concurrently overcoming these interconnected obstacles, underscoring the demand for integrated therapeutic platforms that combine antimicrobial, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;angiogenic properties. Drawing inspiration from natural peroxisomes, a lattice&#8208;reconstructed Ru&#8208;clusters are designed on FeOOH&#8208;based self&#8208;adaptive artificial peroxisome with programmed reactive oxygen species (ROS) regulation for infectious and inflammatory chronic wounds. Within this architecture, electron&#8208;rich Ru clusters and hole&#8208;rich FeOOH domains establish an efficient electron&#8208;transfer network. Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that this distinctive electronic structure lowers reaction energy barriers, enabling pH&#8208;switchable ROS&#8208;catalytic behaviors. Under acidic wound pH, LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH catalyzes ROS generation to disrupt bacterial metabolism and eliminate infections, while under neutral conditions, it efficiently scavenges ROS to alleviate oxidative stress and support tissue repair, enabling a logically sequenced therapeutic progression from infection control to inflammation resolution. In vivo experiments using diabetic foot ulcers confirmed that LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH significantly enhanced bacterial clearance, attenuated inflammatory responses, stimulated neovascularization, and accelerated wound closure. These results position LR&#8208;RuC@FeOOH as an artificial peroxisome with stage&#8208;specific therapies and promising translational potential for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds and other infection&#8208;related pathologies.

         <title>Reconfigurable Physical Unclonable Functions Based on Magnetic Domain Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Spontaneously formed labyrinthine magnetic domains are harnessed as a physical entropy source to construct a reconfigurable spintronic physical unclonable function. By electrically reading domain configurations through magnetic tunnel junctions, unique and random responses are generated, demonstrating strong temperature robustness, machine&#8208;learning resistance, and potential for secure key generation and hardware&#8208;level authentication.








Abstract
Ensuring authentication, data security, and privacy has become critically important with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) employ the intrinsic physical randomness of materials to generate unique, nonreplicable outputs, ensuring device authenticity and protection against cloning. Although silicon&#8208;based PUFs have significantly advanced, developing practical and cost&#8208;effective solutions for resource&#8208;constrained embedded systems remains challenging. This study demonstrates a reconfigurable PUF design that leverages spontaneously formed labyrinth domain patterns in magnetic thin films as a high&#8208;entropy source, without requiring any external stimuli or control. The resulting PUFs display nearly ideal performance in uniqueness, uniformity, bit&#8208;aliasing, and robustness, underscoring their practicality and reliability. These PUFs demonstrate high indivisibility in linear feature spaces and robustness against compromising the security or functionality of machine learning. More importantly, the electrical readout of domain&#8208;based PUF signals is demonstrated using magnetic tunnel junctions and propose an architecture for integrating the PUF system with existing silicon&#8208;based circuits. Overall, the proposed PUF system offers a practical and innovative solution for advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting measures and secure device identification.

         <title>Garnet&#8208;Type Solid&#8208;State Electrolyte with Tailored Lithium Compatibility for High Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative cation&#8211;anion cosubstitution strategy is developed to address the interfacial challenges between garnet electrolytes and lithium metal. This approach effectively improves interfacial contact and suppresses side reactions, significantly enhancing the interfacial compatibility. The breakthrough provides crucial support for accelerating the deployment of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, advancing their practical application.








Abstract
Garnet&#8208;type Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO) solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) demonstrates appealing ionic conductivity for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state battery applications. However, the interfacial compatibility between LLZO and the lithium electrode is yet to be addressed for the deployment of practical batteries at scale. Herein, tailored cubic&#8208;phase garnet&#8208;type Li7La3Zr2&#8208;xScxO12&#8208;xFx (LLZSOF&#8208;x, x = 0&#8211;0.20) SSEs are designed, which features high lithium content and superior compatibility with the lithium metal electrode. The strong binding of fluorine dopant with octahedral lithium ions significantly inhibits Li&#8314;/H&#8314; exchange, thus achieving intimate interfacial contact between composition&#8208;optimized Li7La3Zr1.85Sc0.15O11.85F0.15 (LLZSOF&#8208;0.15) and lithium electrode. Meanwhile, scandium substitution increases lithium content to 7.0, leading to improved reduction stability toward lithium metal. The LLZSOF&#8208;0.15 based symmetric cell yields high critical current density of 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which meets the practical requirements for solid&#8208;state batteries. And LLZSOF&#8208;0.15 based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries show excellent cyclability, with high&#8208;capacity retention of 83.2% over 240 cycles for LiFePO4 and 84.1% over 140 cycles for LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM) (0.5&#8201;C). Li/LLZSOF&#8208;0.15/NCM pouch cells maintain over 99.5% Coulombic efficiency and 94.9% capacity retention after 120 cycles at 0.5 C. This study establishes a material design approach for developing garnet SSEs with superior interfacial compatibility, promoting the deployment of advanced all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries at scale.

         <title>Embedding Cu4X4 Cubane Clusters into Lead Halide Lattices: Stable 3D Cu&#8208;Pb Bimetallic Halide Frameworks for Photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;Ethylene Conversion in Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two aqueous&#8208;stable 3D MI/MII bimetallic (CuI/PbII) halides are successfully synthesized through multi&#8208;component coordination&#8208;driven assembly, featuring cubane&#8208;type [Cu4X4] clusters covalently encapsulated in 3D lead halide frameworks. Both materials exhibit exceptional selectivity in photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion, attributed to the embedded [Cu4X4] modules enhancing carrier&#8208;transport kinetics and forming charge&#8208;polarized PbII&#9472;X&#9472;CuI active sites.








Abstract
3D hybrid lead halides have emerged as promising photofunctional materials; however, the 3D structural prototypes remain scarce due to the stringent requirements for organic cations to fit within the framework cavities and stabilize PbX6 networks. Moreover, their ionic&#8208;bound nature and highly symmetric PbX6 units often result in structural instability and suppressed C&#9472;C coupling capabilities, posing significant challenges for photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2+ conversion in aqueous environments. Herein, a heterometallic crystal engineering strategy is presented for the coordination&#8208;driven assembly of two 3D MI/MII bimetallic halides with the general formula Pb6Cu4X10(ida)3 (ida = iminodiacetate, X = Cl&#8722;/Br&#8722;). The embedding of cubane&#8208;type [Cu4X4] clusters within the lead halide frameworks via covalent PbII&#8211;X&#8211;CuI linkages result in decreased exciton binding energies, smaller Huang&#8211;Rhys factors, and extended photoluminescence lifetimes, which suppress exciton trapping and facilitate carrier transport. Both MI/MII halide frameworks feature asymmetric, halogen&#8208;bridged heterobimetallic sites (PbII&#9472;X&#9472;CuI) with intrinsic charge polarization, which facilitate C&#9472;C coupling during CO2 photoreduction by stabilizing the key *COCOH intermediates. As a result, these heterobimetallic architectures enable highly selective photocatalytic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H4 conversion, achieving up to 95% selectivity in pure water. This work demonstrates a viable strategy for atomic&#8208;level engineering of 3D metal halides toward solar&#8208;driven C2 fuel production.

Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy
A dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme efficiently eliminates ROS in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and performs anti&#8208;inflammatory capability under ultrasound irradiation. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice. More details can be found in the Research Article by Jianhua Hao and co&#8208;workers (DOI: 10.1002/adma.202420189).

         <title>Engineering Framework Materials in Water Systems for Targeted Ion Extraction and Spontaneous Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through comprehensive analysis of framework materials in ion extraction, osmotic energy conversion, and evaporative energy harvesting, this review establishes interdisciplinary connections centered on ion&#8208;selective transport mechanisms across these applications and identifies critical challenges and knowledge gaps in existing studies.








Abstract
Developing techniques that can extract required salt resources and harvest spontaneous energy from natural water environment is essential to promote the global decarbonization and electrification. Construction of advanced framework materials with intrinsic nanochannels has been considered the most promising solution to implement this technique owing to the specific fluid transport performances in such confined space. However, this design requires a deep understanding of the structural properties of framework material nanochannels in different scenarios, as well as the corresponding construction strategies. Consequently, it is an urgent necessity to elucidate the specific ion capture behavior and fluid transport mechanism in these framework materials to build targeted nanofluidic systems for guiding developments in water related resources and energy acquisition technologies. Herein, the recent advances in ion extraction and energy harvesting based on metal&#8208;organic framework and covalent&#8208;organic framework materials have been outlined, along with the discussion about the nanochannels specificity by combining ions and fluid properties and nanochannel structures. Finally, an outlook to trends, challenges and emerging opportunities is given to foresee the future developments in this important field.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Modulation of Magnetization in Magnetic Soft Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation in magnetic soft materials. It introduces fundamental components, discusses strategies for spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization in magnetic soft materials, and highlights representative applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics. The outlook section emphasizes future opportunities for advanced magnetization modulation technologies in magnetic soft materials.








Abstract
Recent decades have witnessed significant advancements in the exploration of magnetic soft materials, driven by diverse fabrication techniques and the demands of various applications. This progress can mainly be attributed to the unique properties of magnetic soft materials, including their untethered and low&#8208;latency manipulation characteristics as well as mechanical compliance. Spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is fundamentally crucial in magnetic soft materials, as it governs the magnetic body forces and torques for self&#8208;actuation, as well as the generation of magnetic fields for external interaction. Despite remarkable progress in magnetic soft materials, a comprehensive review focusing on spatiotemporal magnetization modulation is lacking. This review begins by introducing fundamental components of magnetic soft materials and then explores various strategies for achieving spatial and spatiotemporal modulation of magnetization. Finally, an overview is provided of the typical applications in fluid manipulation, biomedical engineering, and wearable electronics based on magnetization&#8208;modulated magnetic soft materials, along with perspectives on future advancements.

         <title>Personal Moisture Management by Advanced Textiles and Intelligent Wearables</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores advancements in personal moisture management (PMM) through advanced textiles and intelligent wearables, evolving from traditional methods like wicking and evaporation to cutting&#8208;edge innovations such as directional water transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive textiles, and AI&#8208;driven wearables. It also highlights PMM&#8208;enabled applications in health monitoring, energy harvesting, and thermoregulation, while addressing challenges in durability, scalability, and adaptability with intelligent, sustainable solutions.








Abstract
As global climate change intensifies, personal moisture management (PMM) is increasingly crucial for regulating body temperature and near&#8208;skin humidity, sustaining comfort, health, and productivity. Advances in textile materials and wearable technologies are moving PMM beyond traditional wicking&#8208;drying and waterproof&#8208;breathable designs toward directional sweat transport, stimuli&#8208;responsive control, and integration with personal thermal management (PTM). Advanced textiles and intelligent wearables enable more efficient, adaptive PMM; meanwhile, effective PMM enhances sensing performance and long&#8208;term comfort of wearable systems, and supports sweat&#8208;based health monitoring and energy harvesting, forming closed&#8208;loop, intelligent comfort&#8208;health&#8208;performance ecosystems. This review critically discusses PMM mechanisms and designs from capillary wicking and evaporation/diffusion to directional water transport and responsive moisture regulation, alongside manufacturing strategies spanning advanced fibers, nanoengineering, bioinspired architectures, smart polymers, and wearable electronics. PMM&#8208;enabled implementations in health monitoring and energy harvesting are introduced, and elucidate coupled moisture&#8208;heat transport to guide the co&#8208;optimization of PMM and PTM. Finally, key challenges are outlined, including sweat accumulation, reduced durability and washability, limited manufacturing scalability, and insufficient cross&#8209;scenario adaptability, and offer potential solutions, particularly AI&#8209;enabled pathways for intelligent, sustainable, next&#8209;generation PMM textiles and wearables.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

         <title>Challenges and Opportunities of Upconversion Nanoparticles for Emerging NIR Optoelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The special photo&#8208;responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance NIR optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared photons into higher&#8208;energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy&#8208;conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln&#8208;doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next&#8208;generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in&#8208;depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP&#8208;based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP&#8208;based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.

&lt;p&gt;The special photo-responsiveness of upconversion nanoparticles has opened up a new path for the advancement of near-infrared (NIR)-responsive optoelectronics. However, challenges such as low energy-conversion efficiency and high nonradiative losses still persist. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the relationship between materials properties and device performance, offering both theoretical and empirical guidance for the development of high-performance NIR optoelectronic devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs), incorporating lanthanide (Ln) dopants, can convert low-energy near-infrared photons into higher-energy visible or ultraviolet light through nonlinear energy transfer processes. This distinctive feature has attracted considerable attention in both fundamental research and advanced optoelectronics. Challenges such as low energy-conversion efficiency and nonradiative losses limit the performance of UCNP-based optoelectronic devices. Recent advancements including optimized core&#8211;shell structures, tailed Ln-doping concentration, and surface modifications show significant promise for improving the efficiency and stability. In addition, combining UCNPs with functional materials can broaden their applications and improve device performance, paving the way for the innovation of next-generation optoelectronics. This paper first categorizes and elaborates on various upconversion mechanisms in UCNPs, focusing on strategies to boost energy transfer efficiency and prolong luminescence. Subsequently, an in-depth discussion of the various materials that can enhance the efficiency of UCNPs and expand their functionality is provided. Furthermore, a wide range of UCNP-based optoelectronic devices is explored, and multiple emerging applications in UCNP-based neuromorphic computing are highlighted. Finally, the existing challenges and potential solutions involved in developing practical UCNPs optoelectronic devices are considered, as well as an outlook on the future of UCNPs in advanced technologies is provided.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advancements in Carbon&#8208;Based Piezoelectric Materials: Mechanism, Classification, and Applications in Energy Science</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are systematically categorized based on their structural and functional properties. The mechanisms of stress&#8208;induced charge transfer are elucidated, and their applications are explored across three key domains: piezoelectric catalysis for energy conversion and environmental remediation, piezoelectric biomedical treatments for tissue regeneration and antitumor therapies, and piezoelectric generators and sensors for energy harvesting and advanced sensing technologies.








Abstract
The piezoelectric phenomenon has garnered considerable interest due to its distinctive physical properties associated with the materials involved. Piezoelectric materials, which are inherently non&#8208;centrosymmetric, can generate an internal electric field under mechanical stress, enhancing carrier separation and transfer due to electric dipole moments. While inorganic piezoelectric materials are often investigated for their high piezoelectric coefficients, they come with potential drawbacks such as toxicity and high production cost, which hinder their practical applications. Consequently, carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials have emerged as an alternative to inorganic materials, boasting advantages such as a large specific surface area, high conductivity, flexibility, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Research into the applications of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials spans environmental remediation, energy conversion, and biomedical treatments, indicating a promising future. This review marks the first comprehensive attempt to discuss and summarize the various types of carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials. It delves into the underlying mechanisms by which piezoelectricity influences catalysis, biomedical applications, nanogenerators, and sensors. Additionally, various potential techniques are presented to enhance the piezoelectric performance. The design principles of representative fabrication strategies for carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials are analyzed, emphasizing their current limitations and potential improvements for future development. It is believed that recent advances in carbon&#8208;based piezoelectric materials will make a significant impact.

         <title>Harnessing Synergistic Cooperation of Neighboring Active Motifs in Heterogeneous Catalysts for Enhanced Catalytic Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of neighboring active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts, emphasizing how their synergistic cooperativity can be rationally designed to modulate catalytic properties. The discussion centers on the modulation of electronic and geometric structures, categorizing the catalytic systems into metal&#8208;acid (Br&#248;nsted/Lewis) pairs, metal&#8208;base pairs, and metal&#8208;metal pairs. The goal is to provide a systematic overview that offers insights into the design and characterization of next&#8208;generation multifunctional catalysts.








Abstract
Understanding the intricate interplay between catalytically active motifs in heterogeneous catalysts has long posed a significant challenge in the design of highly active and selective reactions. Drawing inspiration from biological enzymes and homogeneous catalysts, the synergistic cooperation between neighboring active motifs has emerged as a crucial factor in achieving effective catalysis. This synergistic control is often observed in natural enzymes and homogeneous systems through ligand coordination. The synergistic interaction is especially vital in reactions involving tandem or cascade steps, where distinct active motifs provide different functionalities to enable the co&#8208;activation of the reaction substrate(s). Situated within a 3D spatial domain, these catalytically active motifs can shape favorable catalytic landscapes by modulating electronic and geometric characteristics, thereby stabilizing specific intermediate or transition state species in a specific catalytic reaction. In this review, we aim to explore a diverse array of the latest heterogeneous catalytic systems that capitalize on the synergistic cooperativity between neighboring active motifs. We will delve into how such synergistic interactions can be utilized to engineer more favorable catalytic landscapes, ultimately resulting in the modulation of catalytic reactivities.

         <title>Bioinspired Design of Heterogenous Single&#8208;Atomic&#8208;Site Catalysts for Electrocatalysis and Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review gives a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies are systematically discussed in the context of the first shell coordination, the second/long&#8208;range coordination, and the outer microenvironment. The applications of SACs in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis as inspired by natural enzymes are discussed.








Abstract
The emergence of single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts (SACs) provides a specific model to bridge the gap between homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis. An interesting aspect in SACs is how to apply the bioinspired strategies in homogeneous biocatalysis to the design of heterogeneous SACs. The effectiveness of this approach relies on systematic insights in structural characteristics and catalytic mechanisms of both the biocatalysts and the heterogeneous SACs. This review will give a summary on the representative bioinspired single&#8208;atomic&#8208;site catalysts and their applications in heterogeneous electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. The fundamentals of bioinspired design strategies will be systematically discussed in the first shell coordination (quasi&#8208;homogeneous metal centers and coordination numbers/species) and the second/long&#8208;range coordination (heteroatoms doping, dual&#8208;metallic sites, nano&#8208;single&#8208;atom&#8208;site, and metal&#8208;support interaction). Also, the unique non&#8208;covalent interactions and oriented mass/proton/electron transfer channels in heterogenous SACs are highlighted as inspired by the outer microenvironment of biological systems. The practical electrocatalytic and photocatalytic applications of bioinspired SACs are further discussed by drawing inspiration from hydrogenase, nitrogenase, oxidase, and dehydrogenase to produce hydrogen&#8208;, carbon&#8208;, nitrogen&#8208;, and oxygen&#8208;based value&#8208;added chemicals. The current challenges and future opportunities for the development of bioinspired heterogenous SACs will also be discussed.

         <dc:description>
Recent advances in ionic conductive textiles for wearable technology are summarized, with a focus on soft ionic conductors that exhibit skin&#8208;like flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics. Their structures, key characteristics, manufacturing methods, and diverse applications are reviewed. Future challenges in sustainability, wearability, fabrication, and electronic integration are discussed, highlighting their potential in healthcare and interactive clothing.








Abstract
Soft ionic conductors, characterized by their inherent flexibility and tissue&#8208;like ion dynamics, are ideal for intimate applications such as wearable electronics for sensing, energy harvesting, signal transmission, and bioelectronics applications. Shaping ionic conductors into fiber and textile formats (i.e., ionic conductive textiles) to replace the focus on rigid electron&#8208;based conductors heralds a transformative technology in wearable electronics and smart textiles, offering advantages that align with human&#8208;device compatibility, wearability, and sustainability demands. In this review, the category of ionic conductors, the essential characteristics of ionic conductors, the methodologies for the fabrication and integration of ionic conductive textiles, and the diverse applications of these textile&#8208;based soft ionic conductors are summarized. By providing perspectives and raising potential challenges on the future design and development of ionic conductive textiles in terms of sustainability, wearability, fabrication strategies, and integration with electrical systems, this review aims to highlight the potential of ionic conductors as key components for the next generation of wearable technologies and electronic textiles.

         <title>Advanced Electrode Materials for Efficient Hydrogen Production in Protonic Ceramic Electrolysis Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) are a promising intermediate&#8208;temperature hydrogen production technology, leveraging high proton conductivity in electrolytes yet constrained by insufficient catalytic activity and interfacial instability in fuel/air electrodes. This review systematically categorizes advanced electrode materials and critically evaluates optimization strategies, including doping, interface engineering, and microstructure control, to enhance their catalytic activity and durability.








Abstract
Protonic ceramic electrolysis cells (PCECs) exhibit superior proton conductivity under intermediate&#8208;temperature operation (300&#8211;600&#160;&#176;C), emerging as a promising water electrolysis technology compared to traditional low&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;conducting polymer electrolysis and high&#8208;temperature oxygen ion&#8208;conducting oxide electrolysis. However, the sluggish kinetics of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and electrode instability in PCECs hinder their large&#8208;scale development. This review highlights recent advancements in PCEC technology, emphasizing its thermodynamic and kinetic advantages, the categorization of advanced electrode materials, and material regulation strategies, including chemical doping, microstructural engineering, and multiphase design to improve their catalytic performance and stability. Additionally, the current challenges are discussed and future research directions are outlined for advanced PCEC electrode materials. By summarizing recent advancements in electrode materials and their optimization strategies, this review provides valuable insights into the rational design of efficient and stable electrode materials, advancing PCEC technology for green hydrogen production.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article provides a comprehensive overview of recent advances in organic photovoltaics (OPVs), covering key aspects such as material development, morphology control, stability challenges, and emerging applications&#8212;including semitransparent OPVs. In addition, future perspectives are discussed to guide the advancement of OPVs toward higher efficiency and enhanced stability.








Abstract
Solar energy is the most promising and ultimate renewable energy resource, and silicon photovoltaic technology has gone through exciting growth globally. Organic photovoltaics (OPVs) provide solar energy solutions for application scenarios different from existing PV technologies. The organic PV technology, with the synergetic progress in the past decades, has now reached 20% power conversion efficiency (PCE), which has the potential to empower serious new applications using the unique features of OPV&#8212;light weight, colorful, semitransparent, flexibility, etc. The concise review focuses on recent device engineering progress in OPV technologies. The background of OPV devices and materials, especially recent nonfullerene acceptors, will first be presented; then, in the recent device engineering progress, the focus will be on active layer engineering to control the morphology of OPV, leading to recent 19%&#8211;20% efficiency. The parallel progress in bulk heterojunction (BHJ) and sequential layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer approaches will be summarized. The transparent OPV (TOPV) devices are of great interest with unique features and provide the broadest design space among all solar technologies. This work reviews the TOPV progress covering the active layer and transparent optical structure designs. The future research directions in OPV are discussed with perspective.

Preceding conventional conductors, the additional combination of unique electrochemical activity and biocompatibility guides CPF to promise a new era of fibrous and textile electronics. Intriguing performance of CPFs roots in the intrinsic properties of conducting polymers, but is also highly related to the multilevel structures of chain aggregates. This fundamental structure&#8208;performance relationship deserves a deep discussion to understand the dramatically increasing achievements in both research and products. Herein, the latest research on CPFs is reviewed to introduce their classification, fabrication methods, and performance. Then, the structure&#8208;performance correlations of reported CPFs are presented to understand the dependence of overall properties on multilevel structures. Further, recent developments regarding the microstructural control and performance optimization of CPFs are discussed as well as their frontier applications in wearable systems, energy converters, and biological probes.

         <title>Plaque&#8208;Targeted Delivery of Fluoride&#8208;Free MXene Nanozyme for Alleviating Atherosclerosis via Sonocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work has developed a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and ultrasound&#8208;responsive Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozyme. ROS&#8208;eliminating and anti&#173;inflammatory capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG under US irradiation are demonstrated on macrophages and endothelial cells in vitro. Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated sonocatalytic therapy exerts an outstanding anti&#8208;atherosclerosis efficacy by regulating intraplaque redox homeostasis, contributing to lesional shrinkage and a more stable plaque phenotype in plaque&#8208;bearing mice.








Abstract
Atherosclerosis is an oxidative stress&#8208;induced chronic inflammatory condition underpinning the progression of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), ultimately resulting in leading mortality rate globally. Ultrasound (US)&#8208;triggered catalysis offers localized treatment for deep&#8208;seated plaques effectively and safely, with demand for targeted delivery and anti&#8208;inflammatory properties of sonosensitizers. 2D MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine is garnering attention because of their intriguing catalytic properties of scavenging excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS), yet MXene&#8208;assisted sonocatalytic therapy (SCT) for treating CVDs remains scarce. Here, this study reports a dual enzyme&#8208;mimicking and US&#8208;responsive MXene termed Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG for alleviating atherosclerosis. US irradiation enhances the capability of Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG nanozymes in eliminating broad&#8208;spectrum ROS and resolving vascular inflammation. Besides, actively targeting lesional macrophages improves their systemic delivery to plaque and further boosts anti&#8208;atherosclerotic efficacy, contributing to &#8776;30% plaque size reduction and a more stabilized plaque phenotype. Notably, etching without hydrofluoric acid renders this nanozyme highly biocompatible. In long&#8208;term biosafety studies, Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG is pronouncedly cleared from major organs and no severe changes of liver and kidney functions are observed. Consequently, this work demonstrates that Nb2C&#8208;Pt@HA&#8208;PEG&#8208;mediated SCT effectively ameliorates advanced atherosclerosis without inducing severe cytotoxicity, offering promising translational potential of MXene&#8208;based nanomedicine. Besides, it broadens application prospects of MXenes to the biomedical field of treating CVDs.

         <title>Active Fabric Origami Enabled by Digital Embroidery of Magnetic Yarns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a scalable textile manufacturing process that fabricates active origami fabrics (AFO) via digital embroidery of magnetic yarns. The programmable AFO exhibits reversible 2D and 3D transformations under magnetic fields, enabling functionalities such as altering surface roughness and linear actuation. These reversible deformation fabrics show promising potential for diverse applications in smart textiles and wearable devices.








Abstract
Active fabrics can perform deformations such as contraction, expansion, and bending when exposed to external stimuli. Origami, the ancient art of paper folding, transforms a 2D sheet into a complex 3D structure. However, integrating origami&#8208;inspired designs into active fabrics presents significant challenges, including the large&#8208;scale production of stimuli&#8208;responsive yarns that can be processed using standard textile techniques to achieve intricate origami patterns with high precision and versatility. In this work, the large&#8208;scale fabrication of magnetic yarns featuring high magnetic susceptibility, mechanical strength, and flexibility is reported, which is enabled by processing magnetic polymer composites with a series of textile engineering processes. Utilizing digital embroidery, these magnetic yarns are programmed into origami patterns with predefined yarn alignments on flexible fabrics to create various active fabric origami structures that are mechanical durable and functional consistent. These structures can reversibly transform among shapes in response to specific magnetic fields, enabling a range of functionalities such as altering surface roughness, delivering linear actuation, mimicking flower blooming, and providing switchable thermal insulation. The novel active fabric origami provides promising smart platforms across areas as diverse as smart textiles, soft robotics, wearable devices, and fashion.

         <title>Ultrastable Calcium Metal Anodes Enabled by a Strongly Coordinated Electrolyte Derived Bilayer Solid Electrolyte Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Exploring reliable electrolytes and constructing favorable SEI structure are pivotal for advancing calcium metal batteries. A strongly solvated and alkaxyborate anion mediated electrolyte demonstrates ultra&#8208;stable Ca metal anodes for over 1450&#160;h. This electrolyte derives an organic (outer)&#8208;inorganic (inner) bi&#8208;layered SEI that facilitates Ca ion migration for Ca metal plating/stripping reactions.








Abstract
Calcium (Ca) metal battery is a promising alternative to current lithium battery chemistry due to the high crustal abundance of Ca element and potentially dendrite&#8208;free cycling of high&#8208;capacity Ca metal anodes. However, reversible Ca metal stripping and plating have been hindered by the lack of effective electrolytes and the formation of obstructive solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layers. Here a strongly coordinated electrolyte system by incorporating LiB(hfip)4 into Ca[B(hfip)4]2/glyme solutions is introduced. The highly coordinated glyme molecules and B(hfip)4&#8722; anions are ready to decompose into organic rich compounds and CaH2, CaB2O4 nanocrystals in the SEI layers on Ca metal surface. Transmission electron microscopy observations reveal that these ionically conductive inorganic particles are embedded beneath the organic&#8208;rich outer layer, thus forming a bilayer SEI configuration. This unique structure facilitates efficient Ca&#8208;ion transfer while preventing further electrolyte decomposition. Effectiveness of this electrolyte is evidenced by the ultrastable Ca//Ca symmetrical cells (over 1450&#160;h with low potentials of &lt;0.5&#160;V vs. Ca/Ca2+ at a high current density of 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and the high&#8208;energy Ca//polyaniline full cells (energy densities of above 200&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 over 200 cycles), which set new benchmarks in the field of room&#8208;temperature Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Upper Layer&#8208;Modulated Pseudo Planar Heterojunction with Metal Complex Acceptor for Efficient and Stable Organic Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is synthesized and incorporated into the upper host acceptor layer of PM6/Y6 to regulate morphology and fill trap states. A high PCE of 18.16% in PM6/Y6:PtAC&#8208;Cl devices is achieved with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;401 h under continuous illumination at MPP tracking and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Modulating self&#8208;aggregation and charge transport in the upper acceptor layer of the pseudo planar heterojunction (PPHJ) is crucial for enhancing dielectric constant and suppressing trap density, leading to efficient and stable organic photovoltaics (OPVs). In this work, a metal complex acceptor (MCA), PtAC&#8208;Cl, is selectively incorporated into the upper host Y6 layer of PPHJ to regulate morphology and fill trap states. There exists a strong chemical interaction between PtAC&#8208;Cl and Y6, which can promote electron transfer. PtAC&#8208;Cl can regulate the self&#8208;aggregation and extend the exciton diffusion length of Y6, resulting in enhanced charge transport and reduced energetic disorder. Consequently, upper layer&#8208;modulated PPHJ devices with PtAC&#8208;Cl achieved a significant power conversion efficiency of 18.16%. The universality of PtAC&#8208;Cl is also demonstrated in PM6/eC9 and PM6/L8&#8208;BO systems, achieving the highest PCEs of 18.79 and 19.30%, respectively. All the improved PCEs are mainly attributed to the enhanced fill factor (FF) and short circuit current (Jsc) compared with the controls. Additionally, PtAC&#8208;Cl significantly improves the thermal stability and photostability of the devices, with a T80 lifetime of &#8776; 401 h under continuous illumination with simulated 1&#8208;Sun light and 1265 h under continuous heating at 70&#160;&#176;C. Overall, this work introduces the concept of MCA and proposes a practical and efficient method to enhance the efficiency and stability of OPVs through selective upper&#8208;layer modulation in PPHJ with MCA.

         <dc:description>
A reusable carbon&#8208;gel ink, incorporating cottonseed peptone as a natural mediator, enables cross&#8208;linked ionic polymer networks for advanced conductivity, stability, and biocompatibility. Compatible with direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing, it facilitates flexible electronics on polymeric and textile substrates for multifunctional applications, including motion sensing, energy harvesting, and self&#8208;powered pressure detection. Integrated smart e&#8208;textile systems have demonstrated human&#8208;machine interaction for signal translation and robotic manipulation.








Abstract
Soft electronics textiles have garnered global attention for their wearability and promising applications in healthcare, energy devices, and artificial intelligence. Recently, direct&#8208;ink&#8208;writing (DIW) technology has shown a growing trend because of its controllability, ease of fabrication, and efficiency. However, the design novelty of printable ink for soft electronic textiles is severely hampered by the intrinsic challenges of integrating printability, conductivity, stretchability, biocompatibility, and durability. Herein, a reusable DIW bio&#8208;carbon gel ink is proposed for printing soft electronic textiles where cottonseed peptone&#8208;functionalized multi&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (CPCNTs) exhibit high dispersibility and reactive surface groups, enabling stable cross&#8208;linking with phytic acid (PA) and polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) to form a strong ionic polymer composite. Encouragingly, the gel ink can be directly exploited to design complex circuits and versatile electronics via DIW printing on both polymeric and textile substrates. The viscoelasticity, mechanical recovery, electric properties, robustness, and stretchable architectures enable it to function as flexible circuits, smart sensors, and renewable generators. As demonstrations, multifunctional applications are presented by real&#8208;time healthcare monitoring, LED lighting, and power generation. Furthermore, this printable gel ink is effectively assembled into an integrated wearable unit for robot manipulation and real&#8208;time gesture recognition, suggesting a significant printing strategy for next&#8208;generation wearable electronics.

         <title>Efficient Low&#8208;temperature Ammonia Cracking Enabled by Strained Heterostructure Interfaces on Ru&#8208;free Catalyst</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the strong metal&#8208;support interaction effect, heterostructured interfaces in a Co&#8208;based catalyst are designed to enable low&#8208;temperature ammonia (NH3) decomposition. The induced tensile lattice strain within the core&#8208;shell structure modulates d&#8208;band center of Co, enhancing NH3 adsorption and facilitating N&#9472;H bond dissociation. Furthermore, the dynamic lattice strain release and restoration mechanism promotes NH3 dehydrogenation and by&#8208;product desorption, effectively optimizing the reaction pathway and ensuring sustained catalytic activity.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) has emerged as a promising liquid carrier for hydrogen (H2) storage. However, its widespread adoption in H2 technology is impeded by the reliance on costly Ru catalysts for low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking reaction. Here, a strained heterostructure Co@BaAl2O4&#8722;x core@shell catalyst is reported that demonstrates catalytic performance at low reaction temperatures comparable to most Ru&#8208;based catalysts. This catalyst exhibits exceptional activity across a range of space velocity conditions, maintaining high conversion rates at 475 to 575&#160;&#176;C and achieving an impressive H2 production rate of 64.6&#160;mmol H2 gcat&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1. Synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, and kinetic studies are carried out to elucidate the dynamic changes of the strained heterostructure interface of Co&#8208;core and BaAl2O4&#8722;x&#8208;overlayer under catalytic working conditions. The performance enhancement mechanisms are attributed to the tensile strained Co surface encapsulated in the defective BaAl2O4&#8722;x, which enhances NH3 adsorption and facilitates the rate&#8208;determining N&#9472;H dissociation. Furthermore, the strain release and restoration during NH3 dehydrogenation enable efficient nitrogen desorption, preventing active site poisoning. This work highlights the effectiveness of lattice strain engineering and the development of synergistic strong metal&#8208;support interfaces between active metal nanoparticles and oxide support to boost low&#8208;temperature NH3 cracking.

         <title>Interface Reinforced Tailoring of Quantum Dots Regulates Reaction Trajectory of CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface&#8208;reinforced regulation strategy is proposed to tailor the activation mode of CO2 in water. The facilitation of directional electron transfer and the interface&#8208;reinforced charge difference of the catalytic site at the CdSe/S/InS QD interface greatly promotes the shift of reaction trajectory of CO2 photoreduction, i.e., the main HCOO&#8722; product for CdSe is transformed into CO for CdSe/S/InS QDs.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthesis using semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) is one of the most promising pathways toward converting CO2 into valuable chemicals. However, the multistep process of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion endows the regulation of reaction trajectory from CO2 to specific products very challenging in aqueous solution. Here, it is first disclosed that the anisotropic growth of CdSe&#8722;S&#8722;InS interface in ultrafine heterojunction QDs alters the trajectory of CO2 photoreduction in water, i.e., CdSe/S/InS QDs mainly produce CO while CdSe QDs generate HCOO&#8722;. Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; vs QDs) with a selectivity of &gt;96% in C&#8208;based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H2. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface&#8208;reinforced tailoring of CO2 reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO2 activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.

Under optimal conditions, the CO turnover number of CdSe/S/InS QDs is &#8776;1000 (12 h; &lt;i&gt;vs&lt;/i&gt; QDs) with a selectivity of &amp;gt;96% in C-based products or &#8776;57.6% when considering H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The formation of anisotropic CdSe/S/InS ultrafine heterojunction facilitates charge migration at the interface, which is confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and transient absorption spectroscopy. Further DFT simulations and in situ experiments demonstrate that the interfacial lattice expansion reinforces the charge difference at the interface, thus contributing to the product shift from HCOOH to CO, which clarifies the mechanism of interface-reinforced tailoring of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reaction trajectories. This work can not only provide guidance for interfacial CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; activation mode in water but also inspire the design of novel artificial photocatalysts with new functions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Green, Safe, Durable, Printed Fabric Hygroelectric Generators for Wearable Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work achieves a green hygroelectric generator with enhanced electric outputs. All chemicals and materials used in the hygroelectric generators are safe for human and environmentally friendly. The device achieves an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2 V and a short&#8208;circuit current of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2 at room humidity of 55% through the synergistic effect of ion migration and water absorption.








Abstract
Hygroelectric generators, converting energy from moisture into electricity, have attracted great interest due to sustainable and ubiquitous moisture in the environment. However, it is absolutely necessary to replace the fragile and noxious materials reported previously in the hygroelectric generators before real applications for wearables. Herein, a green hygroelectric generator with a high current density is designed for the first time by printing functional materials that are abundant, safe to humans and environments. By engineering printable hydrogel through the synergistic effect of water absorption and ion migration on the fabric, the wearable fabric hygroelectric generators deliver a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.2&#160;V with a remarkable short&#8208;circuit current density of 1.0 mA&#183;cm&#8722;2, more than 7 times that of most reported hygroelectric generators. The devices show no performance declination after long&#8208;term storage and bending tests due to the design of stable hydrogel and robust electrode/hydrogel interfaces. Moreover, the devices with cross&#8208;finger structures achieve a facile scalable integration for enhanced electric outputs. Exemplifying applications illustrate the great potential of the printed fabric hygroelectric generators as a direct current power supply for wearable applications. This work sheds light on a novel avenue to design safe and environmentally friendly energy harvesting devices for practical applications.

         <title>Janus Cellular Design Drives Solar&#8208;Powered Spatial Lithium Extraction and Water Co&#8208;Generation from Salt&#8208;Lake Brines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D&#8208;printed Janus cellular solar platform integrates photothermal evaporation, ion&#8208;diffusion&#8208;guided lithium enrichment, and flipping&#8208;induced salt removal. The asymmetric lattice, fabricated via high&#8208;resolution printing and functionalized with porous adsorbents, enables simultaneous water harvesting and selective lithium extraction from hypersaline brines, offering a scalable and energy&#8208;efficient route for sustainable resource recovery.








Abstract
Lithium plays a vital role in energy storage technologies, with global demand rapidly increasing. Current adsorption&#8208;based direct lithium extraction from salt&#8208;lake brines holds promise but suffers from low ion extraction efficiency due to sluggish intercalation kinetics and poor selectivity, necessitating repeated cycles that increase water and energy consumption. Here, a Janus cellular&#8208;structured solar&#8208;powered platform (JCSP) is developed for energy&#8208;efficient lithium extraction and sustainable water harvesting. The cellular platform features a symmetrical, multi&#8208;branched cantilever geometry with distinct upper and lower lattice architectures, where the lower lattice is functionalized with titanium&#8208;based porous adsorbents. This rational lattice design and functionalized adsorption interfaces enhance light absorption, sustain evaporative flow, and create an ion diffusion gradient for selective lithium extraction. Its cantilever configuration enables a self&#8208;flipping mechanism, preventing salt crystallization and ensuring long&#8208;term stability in high&#8208;salinity environments. This design boosts water evaporation efficiency to 3.85&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1, increases lithium adsorption capacity to 43.5&#160;mg g&#8722;1, and enhances Li+/Na+ and Li+/Mg2+ selectivity to 112 and 268, respectively, when treating multi&#8208;ionic hypersaline environment (20 wt% total dissolved salt). The JCSP system demonstrates stable long&#8208;term performance in water evaporation and lithium recovery under extreme conditions, providing a sustainable solution to global water scarcity and rising lithium demand.

         <title>Advancing Self&#8208;Assembled Molecules Toward Interface&#8208;Optimized Perovskite Solar Cells: from One to Two</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 48, December 3, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the past few years, self&#8208;assembled molecules (SAMs) have ushered in a new era of interface engineering for perovskite solar cells. Herein, the recent progresses of co&#8208;SAM, namely two SAMs with synergy, are comprehensively summarized and analyzed, focusing on topics including deposition methods and design principles, while further challenges about mechanisms, materials, and applications are also outlined.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have rapidly gained prominence as a leading candidate in the realm of solution&#8208;processable third&#8208;generation photovoltaic (PV) technologies. In the high&#8208;efficiency inverted PSCs, self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) are often used as hole&#8208;selective layers (HSLs) due to&#160;the advantages of high transmittance, energy level matching, low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss, and tunable surface properties. However, SAMs have been recognized to suffer from some shortcomings, such as incomplete coverage, weak bonding with substrate or perovskite, instability, and so on. The combination of different SAMs or so&#8208;called co&#8208;SAM is an effective strategy to overcome this challenge. In this Perspective, the latest achievements in molecule design, deposition method, working principle, and application of the co&#8208;SAM are discussed. This comprehensive overview of milestones in this rapidly advancing research field, coupled with an in&#8208;depth analysis of the improved interface properties using the co&#8208;SAM approach, aims to offer valuable insights into the key design principles. Furthermore, the lessons learned will guide the future development of SAM&#8208;based HSLs in perovskite&#8208;based optoelectronic devices.
