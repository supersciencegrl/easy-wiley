         <title>Oriented Perovskite Growth Regulation Enables Sensitive Broadband Detection and Imaging of Polarized Photons Covering 300&#8211;1050&#160;nm</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polarization photodetectors with solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA=methylammonium) polycrystalline film as photoactive layer are designed to sensitively detect and image the polarized photons from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. Additives play an important role in regulating oriented crystal growth. This low&#8208;cost and facile fabrication process can pave the way for universal application of polarization photodetector toward accurate target recognition in military and civilian fields.








Abstract
Photodetectors selective to the polarization empower breakthroughs in sensing technology for target identification. However, the realization of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on intrinsically anisotropic crystal structure or extrinsically anisotropic device pattern requires complicated epitaxy and etching processes, which limit scalable production and application. Here, solution&#8208;processed PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 (PEA= phenylethylammonium, MA= methylammonium) polycrystalline film is probed as photoactive layer toward sensing polarized photon from 300 to 1050&#160;nm. The growth of the PEA2MA4(Sn0.5Pb0.5)5I16 crystal occurs in confined crystallographic orientation of the (202) facet upon the assistance of NH4SCN and NH4Cl, enhancing anisotropic photoelectric properties. Therefore, the photodetector achieves a polarization ratio of 0.41 and dichroism ratio (Imax/Imin) of 2.4 at 900&#160;nm. At 520&#160;nm, the Imax/Imin even surpasses the one of the perovskite crystalline films, 1.8 and &#8776;1.2, respectively. It is worth noting that the superior figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits possess a response width of 900&#160;kHz, Ion/Ioff ratio of &#8776;3 &#215; 108, linear dynamic range from 0.15 nW to 12&#160;mW, noise current of 8.28 &#215; 10&#8722;13 A &#215; Hz&#8722;0.5, and specific detectivity of 1.53 &#215; 1012 Jones, which demonstrate high resolution and high speed for weak signal sensing and imaging. The proof of concept in polarized imaging confirms that the polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetector meets the requirements for practical application in target recognition.

         <title>Stabilizing &#947;&#8208;MgH2 at Nanotwins in Mechanically Constrained Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The intrinsic formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during hydrogenation of suitably designed Mg nanoparticles is demonstrated. A formation mechanism is proposed and the primary degradation mechanism of the nanoparticles based on transmission electron microscopy is identified. The combined knowledge of both mechanisms is expected to enable cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based materials for dynamic plasmonics and hydrogen storage, as &#947;&#8208;MgH2 enhances dehydrogenation kinetics and thermodynamics.








Abstract
Reversible hydrogen uptake and the metal/dielectric transition make the Mg/MgH2 system a prime candidate for solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage and dynamic plasmonics. However, high dehydrogenation temperatures and slow dehydrogenation hamper broad applicability. One promising strategy to improve dehydrogenation is the formation of metastable &#947;&#8208;MgH2. A nanoparticle (NP) design, where &#947;&#8208;MgH2 forms intrinsically during hydrogenation is presented and a formation mechanism based on transmission electron microscopy results is proposed. Volume expansion during hydrogenation causes compressive stress within the confined, anisotropic NPs, leading to plastic deformation of &#946;&#8208;MgH2 via (301)&#946; twinning. It is proposed that these twins nucleate &#947;&#8208;MgH2 nanolamellas, which are stabilized by residual compressive stress. Understanding this mechanism is a crucial step toward cycle&#8208;stable, Mg&#8208;based dynamic plasmonic and hydrogen&#8208;storage materials with improved dehydrogenation. It is envisioned that a more general design of confined NPs utilizes the inherent volume expansion to reform &#947;&#8208;MgH2 during each rehydrogenation.

         <title>Tumor&#8208;Targeting Cholesterol&#8208;Decorated DNA Nanoflowers for Intracellular Ratiometric Aptasensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite (DNA nanoflower) intracellular aptasensor with sequence&#8208;encoded multifunctional features is realized by implementing enzymatic amplification&#8208;driven biomimetic crystallization. This platform is capable of ratiometric and quantitative intracellular detection upon targeted delivery and holds substantial promise as strategically self&#8208;assembled DNA nanosensors for interrogating cellular analytes whose changes in abundance are explained as a continuous function.








Abstract
Probing endogenous molecular profiles is of fundamental importance to understand cellular function and processes. Despite the promise of programmable nucleic&#8208;acid&#8208;based aptasensors across the breadth of biomolecular detection, target&#8208;responsive aptasensors enabling intracellular detection are as of yet infrequently realized. Several challenges remain, including the difficulties in quantification/normalization of quencher&#8208;based intensiometric signals, stability issues of the probe architecture, and complex sensor operations often necessitating extensive structural modeling. Here, the biomimetic crystallization&#8208;empowered self&#8208;assembly of a tumor&#8208;targetable DNA&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposite aptasensor is presented, which enables F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)&#8208;based quantitative interpretation of changes in the cellular target abundance. Leveraging the design programmability and high&#8208;throughput fabrication of rolling circle amplification&#8208;driven DNA nanoarchitecture, this designer platform offers a method to self&#8208;assemble a robust nanosensor from a multifunctionality&#8208;encoded template that includes a cell&#8208;targeting aptamer, a ratiometric aptasensor, and a cholesterol&#8208;decorating element. Taking prostate cancer cells and intracellular adenosine triphosphate molecules as a model system, a synergistic effect in the targeted delivery by cholesterol and aptamers, and the feasibility of quantitative intracellular aptasensing are demonstrated. It is envisioned that this approach provides a highly generalizable strategy across wide&#8208;ranging target systems toward a biologically deliverable nanosensor that enables quantitative monitoring of the abundance of endogenous biomolecules.

         <title>Poly(vinyl alcohol) Hydrogels with Broad&#8208;Range Tunable Mechanical Properties via the Hofmeister Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A freeze&#8208;soak strategy is proposed to make hydrogels with broad&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties via the Hofmeister effect. Because of the various aggregation degrees of the polymers chains induced by the Hofmeister effect, hydrogels with ultrahigh&#8208;toughness and wide&#8208;range tunable mechanical properties can be made by changing the salt types and concentrations. Meanwhile, the mechanics of the hydrogel can be in situ tuned dynamically.








Abstract
Hydrogels, exhibiting wide applications in soft robotics, tissue engineering, implantable electronics, etc., often require sophisticately tailoring of the hydrogel mechanical properties to meet specific demands. For examples, soft robotics necessitates tough hydrogels; stem cell culturing demands various tissue&#8208;matching modulus; and neuron probes desire dynamically tunable modulus. Herein, a strategy to broadly alter the mechanical properties of hydrogels reversibly via tuning the aggregation states of the polymer chains by ions based on the Hofmeister effect is reported. An ultratough poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as an exemplary material (toughness 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3), which surpasses synthetic polymers like poly(dimethylsiloxane), synthetic rubber, and natural spider silk is fabricated. With various ions, the hydrogel's various mechanical properties are continuously and reversibly in situ modulated over a large window: tensile strength from 50 &#177; 9&#160;kPa to 15 &#177; 1&#160;MPa, toughness from 0.0167&#160;&#177; 0.003 to 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, elongation from 300&#160;&#177; 100% to 2100&#160;&#177; 300%, and modulus from 24 &#177; 2 to 2500 &#177; 140&#160;kPa. Importantly, the ions serve as gelation triggers and property modulators only, not necessarily required to remain in the gel, maintaining the high biocompatibility of PVA without excess ions. This strategy, enabling high mechanical performance and broad dynamic tunability, presents a universal platform for broad applications from biomedicine to wearable electronics.

An ultratough poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) hydrogel as an exemplary material (toughness 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;), which surpasses synthetic polymers like poly(dimethylsiloxane), synthetic rubber, and natural spider silk is fabricated. With various ions, the hydrogel's various mechanical properties are continuously and reversibly in situ modulated over a large window: tensile strength from 50 &#177; 9&#160;kPa to 15 &#177; 1&#160;MPa, toughness from 0.0167&#160;&#177; 0.003 to 150 &#177; 20&#160;MJ&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;3&lt;/sup&gt;, elongation from 300&#160;&#177; 100% to 2100&#160;&#177; 300%, and modulus from 24 &#177; 2 to 2500 &#177; 140&#160;kPa. Importantly, the ions serve as gelation triggers and property modulators only, not necessarily required to remain in the gel, maintaining the high biocompatibility of PVA without excess ions. This strategy, enabling high mechanical performance and broad dynamic tunability, presents a universal platform for broad applications from biomedicine to wearable electronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Synergistic Manipulation of Zn2+ Ion Flux and Desolvation Effect Enabled by Anodic Growth of a 3D ZnF2 Matrix for Long&#8208;Lifespan and Dendrite&#8208;Free Zn Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) is prepared through a simple and fast electrochemical anodic growth method. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics.








Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable Zn metal batteries have attracted widespread attention due to the intrinsic high volumetric capacity, low cost, and high safety. However, the low Coulombic efficiency and limited lifespan of Zn metal anodes resulting from uncontrollable growth of Zn dendrites impede their practical application. In this work, a 3D interconnected ZnF2 matrix is designed on the surface of Zn foil (Zn@ZnF2) through a simple and fast anodic growth method, serving as a multifunctional protective layer. The as&#8208;fabricated Zn@ZnF2 electrode can not only redistribute the Zn2+ ion flux, but also reduce the desolvation active energy significantly, leading to stable and facile Zn deposition kinetics. The results reveal that the Zn@ZnF2 electrode can effectively inhibit dendrites growth, restrain the hydrogen evolution reactions, and endow excellent plating/stripping reversibility. Accordingly, the Zn@ZnF2 electrode exhibits a long cycle life of over 800 h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2 in a symmetrical cell test, the feasibility of which is also convincing in Zn@ZnF2//MnO2 and Zn@ZnF2//V2O5 full batteries. Importantly, a hybrid zinc&#8208;ion capacitor of the Zn@ZnF2//AC can work at an ultrahigh current density of &#8776;60&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for up to 5000 cycles with a high capacity retention of 92.8%.

         <title>Tensegrity Metamaterials: Toward Failure&#8208;Resistant Engineering Systems through Delocalized Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Failure of materials and structures is typically preceded by a catastrophic chain reaction of locally confined damage events, while large parts of the system do not experience critical loads. Breaking with this established paradigm, this study introduces the concept of delocalized deformation enabling failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials via 3D tensegrity metamaterials.








Abstract
Failure of materials and structures is inherently linked to localized mechanisms, from shear banding in metals, to crack propagation in ceramics and collapse of space&#8208;trusses after buckling of individual struts. In lightweight structures, localized deformation causes catastrophic failure, limiting their application to small strain regimes. To ensure robustness under real&#8208;world nonlinear loading scenarios, overdesigned linear&#8208;elastic constructions are adopted. Here, the concept of delocalized deformation as a pathway to failure&#8208;resistant structures and materials is introduced. Space&#8208;tileable tensegrity metamaterials achieving delocalized deformation via the discontinuity of their compression members are presented. Unprecedented failure resistance is shown, with up to 25&#8208;fold enhancement in deformability and orders of magnitude increased energy absorption capability without failure over same&#8208;strength state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art lattice architectures. This study provides important groundwork for design of superior engineering systems, from reusable impact protection systems to adaptive load&#8208;bearing structures.

         <title>Exfoliation of Alpha&#8208;Germanium: A Covalent Diamond&#8208;Like Structure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
&#945;&#8208;Germanium crystals are exfoliated using a wet ball&#8208;milling technique to produce &#945;&#8208;germanium nanolayers (&#945;&#8208;Ge NLs) in a process that is upscaled to gram production. The &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs can be redispersed using a shear&#8208;mixer, yielding very stable suspensions. Theoretical calculations predict a thickness&#8208;dependent bandgap of these NLs that is confirmed by electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy of &#945;&#8208;Ge NLs with different orientations.








Abstract
2D materials have opened a new field in materials science with outstanding scientific and technological impact. A largely explored route for the preparation of 2D materials is the exfoliation of layered crystals with weak forces between their layers. However, its application to covalent crystals remains elusive. Herein, a further step is taken by introducing the exfoliation of germanium, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor presenting a 3D diamond&#8208;like structure with strong covalent bonds. Pure &#945;&#8208;germanium is exfoliated following a simple one&#8208;step procedure assisted by wet ball&#8208;milling, allowing gram&#8208;scale fabrication of high&#8208;quality layers with large lateral dimensions and nanometer thicknesses. The generated flakes are thoroughly characterized by different techniques, giving evidence that the new 2D material exhibits bandgaps that depend on both the crystallographic direction and the number of layers. Besides potential technological applications, this work is also of interest for the search of 2D materials with new properties.

Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts. A comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208; and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their widespread practical applications is provided.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites have exhibited significantly superior nonlinear optical properties compared to traditional semiconductor counterparts, thanks to their peculiar physical and electronic structures. Their exceptional nonlinear optical characteristics make them excellent candidates for revolutionizing widespread applications. However, the research of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites is in its infancy. There is a lack of comprehensive and in&#8208;depth summary of this research realm. Here, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research progress related to third&#8208;and higher&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties of low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites with diverse crystal structures from 3D down to 0D, together with their practical applications, is summarized comprehensively. Critical discussions are offered on the&#160;fundamental mechanisms beneath their exceptional nonlinear optical performance&#160;from the physics viewpoint, attempting to disclose the role of intrinsic attributes (e.g., composition, bandgap, size, shape, and structure) and external modulation strategies (e.g., developing core&#8211;shell structures, transition metal ion doping, and hybridization with dielectric microspheres) in tuning the response. Additionally, their potential applications in nonlinear photonics, nonlinear optoelectronics, and biophotonics are systematically and thoroughly summed up and categorized. Lastly, insights into the current technical challenges and future research opportunities of nonlinear photonics based on low&#8208;dimensional metal&#8208;halide perovskites are provided.

         <title>Ductile Ag20S7Te3 with Excellent Shape&#8208;Conformability and High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new ductile inorganic thermoelectric (TE) material, Ag20S7Te3, with high carrier mobility, low lattice thermal conductivity, and a maximum zT of 0.80 at 600 K is reported. The prototype hetero&#8208;shaped TE generator consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#956;W under a temperature difference of 70 K.








Abstract
Hetero&#8208;shaped thermoelectric (TE) generators (TEGs) can power the sensors used in safety monitoring systems of undersea oil pipelines, but their development is greatly limited by the lack of materials with both good shape&#8208;conformable ability and high TE performance. In this work, a new ductile inorganic TE material, Ag20S7Te3, with high TE performance is reported. At 300&#8211;600 K, Ag20S7Te3 crystallizes in a body&#8208;centered cubic structure, in which S and Te atoms randomly occupy the (0, 0, 1) site. Due to the smaller generalized stacking fault energy in the (101&#175;)[010] slip system, Ag20S7Te3 shows better ductility than Ag2S, yielding excellent shape&#8208;conformability. The high carrier mobility and low lattice thermal conductivity observed in Ag20S7Te3 result in a maximum dimensionless figure of merit (zT) of 0.80 at 600 K, which is comparable with the best commercial Bi2Te3&#8208;based alloys. The prototype TEG consisting of 10 Ag20S7Te3 strips displays an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 69.2&#160;mV and a maximum power output of 17.1 &#181;W under the temperature difference of 70 K. This study creates a new route toward hetero&#8208;shaped TEG.

         <title>Embolization of Vascular Malformations via In Situ Photocrosslinking of Mechanically Reinforced Alginate Microfibers using an Optical&#8208;Fiber&#8208;Integrated Microfluidic Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder is proposed that employs the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking through visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking by Ca2+ in the blood. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device that can continuously form hydrogel microfibers by in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is developed.








Abstract
Embolization, which is a minimally invasive endovascular treatment, is a safe and effective procedure for treating vascular malformations (e.g., aneurysms). Hydrogel microfibers obtained via spatiotemporally controllable in situ photocrosslinking exhibit great potential for embolizing aneurysms. However, this process is challenging because of the absence of biocompatible and morphologically stable hydrogels and the difficulty in continuously spinning the microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments such as those involving a tortuous geometry and high absorbance. A double&#8208;crosslinked alginate&#8208;based hydrogel with tantalum nanopowder (DAT) that exploits the synergistic effect of covalent crosslinking by visible&#8208;light irradiation and ionic crosslinking using Ca2+, which is present in the blood, is developed in this study. Furthermore, an effective strategy to design and produce an optical&#8208;fiber&#8208;integrated microfluidic device (OFI&#8208;MD) that can continuously spin hydrogel microfibers via in situ photocrosslinking in extreme endovascular environments is proposed. As an embolic material, DAT exhibits promising characteristics such as radiopacity, nondissociation, nonswelling, and constant mechanical strength in blood, in addition to excellent cyto&#8208; and hemo&#8208;compatibilities. Using OFI&#8208;MD to spin DAT microfibers continuously can help fill aneurysms safely, uniformly, and completely within the endovascular simulator without generating microscopic fragments, which demonstrates its potential as an effective embolization strategy.

         <title>Polycationic Polymer Layer for Air&#8208;Stable and Dendrite&#8208;Free Li Metal Anodes in Carbonate Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polycationic and hydrophobic polymer protective layer of Li metal is developed by a scalable tape&#8208;casting method. Steady Li plating/stripping in commercial carbonate electrolyte can be achieved under a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 with Li utilization efficiency up to 51.6%. The modified Li also shows unaffected performance after exposure to ambient air or contacting with water.








Abstract
The short cycle life and safety concerns caused by uncontrollable dendrite growth have severely hindered the commercialization of lithium metal batteries. Here, a polycationic and hydrophobic polymer protective layer fabricated by a scalable tape&#8208;casting method is developed to enable air&#8208;stable, dendrite&#8208;free, and highly efficient Li metal anodes. The polymeric cations of poly(diallyl dimethyl ammonium) (PDDA) provide an electrostatic shielding effect that unifies Li+ flux at the surface of the Li anode and promotes a homogeneous Li plating, while the bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (TFSI) anions bring hydrophobic characteristics and improve moisture stability. The accumulated TFSI anions by the polycationic film also facilitate the formation of a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Steady Li plating/stripping in the carbonate electrolyte can be achieved under a high areal capacity of 10 mAh cm&#8722;2 for 700 h with Li utilization efficiency up to 51.6%. LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 and LiFePO4 cells using the modified anode exhibit much improved electrochemical performance compared with the bare Li counterpart. Moreover, ultrasonic imaging shows no gas generation in the modified Li/LiFePO4 pouch cell. Mechanism investigation demonstrates the stable SEI and homogeneous Li deposition derived by the polycationic layer.

         <title>Selective Release of Different Neurotransmitters Emulated by a p&#8211;i&#8211;n Junction Synaptic Transistor for Environment&#8208;Responsive Action Control</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor is fabricated to emulate the reconfigurability of a biological synapse that expresses complex emotions of attraction or aversion. It enables high&#8208;accuracy pattern recognition, and controls artificial muscle to move in different directions in response to different external stimuli. These properties can be important in designing complex neuromorphic systems.








Abstract
The design of the first p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction synaptic transistor (JST) based on n&#8208;type TiO2 film covered with poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) and with a p&#8208;type P3HT/PEO nanowire (NW) on top. Except for basic synaptic functions that can be realized by a single neurotransmitter, the electronic device emulates the multiplexed neurotransmission of different neurotransmissions, i.e., glutamate and acetylcholine, for fast switching between short&#8208; and long&#8208;term plasticity (STP and LTP). This is realized by the special p&#8211;i&#8211;n junction with hole transport in the p&#8208;type P3HT NW to form STP, and electron transport in the n&#8208;type TiO2 layer and trapped under the PMMA inversion layer to form LTP. Altering the external input induces changes of the polarity of the charge carriers in the conductive channel, promoting fast switching between STP and LTP modes. When stimulated using two parallel inputs, the response of PMMA/TiO2 emulates the synergistic effect of taste and aroma on the control of food&#8208;intake in the brain. Because of the bipolarity, the p&#8211;i&#8211;n JST has excellent reconfigurability, which importantly is attributed to simulate the plasticity of synapses and to mimic how distinct types of gustatory receptor neurons respond to different concentrations of salt. The electronic device lays the technical foundation for the realization of the future complex artificial neural networks.

         <title>Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.








Abstract
Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers. Increased efficiency of the current&#8208;induced domain wall motion is a prerequisite for commercially viable racetrack devices. Here, significantly increased efficiency with substantially lower threshold current densities and enhanced domain wall velocities is demonstrated by the introduction of atomically thin 4d and 5d metal &#8220;dusting&#8221; layers at the interface between the lower magnetic layer of the racetrack (here cobalt) and platinum. The greatest efficiency is found for dusting layers of palladium and rhodium, just one monolayer thick, for which the domain wall's velocity is increased by up to a factor of 3.5. Remarkably, when the heavy metal layer is formed from the dusting layer material alone, the efficiency is rather reduced by an order of magnitude.

     alt="Increased Efficiency of Current&#8208;Induced Motion of Chiral Domain Walls by Interface Engineering"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The efficiency of current&#8208;induced domain wall motion in both ferromagnetic/heavy metal and synthetic antiferromagnet systems is significantly enhanced via the insertion of atomically thin dusting layers at the ferromagnet/heavy metal interface. The enhancement is due to the tuning of the strength of the Dzyaloshiskii&#8211;Moriya interaction and the effective magnetic uniaxial anisotropy energy.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Magnetic racetrack devices are promising candidates for next&#8208;generation memories. These spintronic shift&#8208;register devices are formed from perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnet/heavy metal thin&#8208;film systems. Data are encoded in domain wall magnetic bits that have a chiral N&#233;el structure that is stabilized by an interfacial Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The bits are manipulated by spin currents generated from electrical currents that are passed through the heavy metal layers. Increased efficiency of the current&#8208;induced domain wall motion is a prerequisite for commercially viable racetrack devices. Here, significantly increased efficiency with substantially lower threshold current densities and enhanced domain wall velocities is demonstrated by the introduction of atomically thin 4d and 5d metal &#8220;dusting&#8221; layers at the interface between the lower magnetic layer of the racetrack (here cobalt) and platinum. The greatest efficiency is found for dusting layers of palladium and rhodium, just one monolayer thick, for which the domain wall's velocity is increased by up to a factor of 3.5. Remarkably, when the heavy metal layer is formed from the dusting layer material alone, the efficiency is rather reduced by an order of magnitude. The results point to the critical role of interface engineering for the development of efficient racetrack memory devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stabilizing Fullerene for Burn&#8208;in&#8208;Free and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells under Ultraviolet Preconditioning and Light Soaking</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Over 23% efficiency is achieved using a stabilized phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM):bathophenanthroline (Bphen) interlayer in SnO2&#8208;based perovskite solar cells, which can retain over 92% of their initial efficiency after 1000&#160;h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60 &#176;C.








Abstract
It is crucial to make perovskite solar cells sustainable and have a stable operation under natural light soaking before they become commercially acceptable. Herein, a small amount of the small molecule bathophenanthroline (Bphen) is introduced into [6,6]&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester and it is found that Bphen can stabilize the C60&#8208;cage well through formation of much more thermodynamically stable charge&#8208;transfer complexes. Such a strengthened complex is used as an interlayer at the in&#8208;light perovskite/SnO2 side to achieve a champion device with efficiency of 23.09% (certified 22.85%). Most importantly, the stability of the resulting devices can be close to meeting the requirements of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61215 standard under simulated UV preconditioning and light&#8208;soaking testing. They can retain over 95% and 92% of their initial efficiencies after 1100 h UV irradiation and 1000 h continuous illumination of maximum power point tracking at 60&#160;&#176;C, respectively.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Engineering Induced Anisotropic Crystallite Orientation and Maximized Carrier Mobility for High&#8208;Performance Microfiber&#8208;Based Organic Bioelectronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors are reported, which display unprecedentedly large figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#956;C*&#160;&#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) using highly ordered crystalline PEDOT:PSS microfibers with enhanced carrier mobility (12.9&#160;cm2 V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) owing to the highly anisotropic crystallite domain ordering along the fiber direction via uniaxial strain engineering in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization.








Abstract
Despite the importance of carrier mobility, recent research efforts have been mainly focused on the improvement of volumetric capacitance in order to maximize the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit, &#956;C* (product of carrier mobility and volumetric capacitance), for high&#8208;performance organic electrochemical transistors. Herein, high&#8208;performance microfiber&#8208;based organic electrochemical transistors with unprecedentedly large &#956;C* using highly ordered crystalline poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) microfibers with very high carrier mobilities are reported. The strain engineering via uniaxial tension is employed in combination with solvent&#8208;mediated crystallization in the course of drying coagulated fibers, resulting in the permanent preferential alignment of crystalline PEDOT:PSS domains along the fiber direction, which is verified by atomic force microscopy and transmission wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering. The resultant strain&#8208;engineered microfibers exhibit very high carrier mobility (12.9 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) without the trade&#8208;off in volumetric capacitance (122&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;3) and hole density (5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;1020&#160;cm&#8722;3). Such advantageous electrical and electrochemical characteristics offer the benchmark parameter of &#956;C* over &#8776;1500&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, which is the highest metric ever reported in the literature and can be beneficial for realizing a new class of substrate&#8208;free fibrillar and/or textile bioelectronics in the configuration of electrochemical transistors and/or electrochemical ion pumps.

         <title>Electron Density&#8208;Change in Semiconductor by Ion&#8208;Adsorption at Solid&#8211;Liquid Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;immersed Hall measurements are proposed to find direct evidence of ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Electron density&#8208;change by diffusion&#8208;driven ion dynamics occurs in fully liquid&#8208;submerged device designed to monitor ion&#8208;specific dynamics in aqueous bulk phases. The ion&#8208;concentration gradient and diffusion coefficient of mobile ions are correlated with ion&#8208;adsorption rate, causing electric signal variations in the semiconductor.








Abstract
The change in electrical properties of electrodes by adsorption or desorption at interfaces is a well&#8208;known phenomenon required for signal production in electrically transduced sensing technologies. Furthermore, in terms of electrolyte&#8211;insulator&#8211;semiconductor (EIS) structure, several studies of energy conversion techniques focused on ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface have suggested that the electric signal is generated by ionovoltaic phenomena. However, finding substantial clues for the ion&#8208;adsorption phenomena in the EIS structure is still a difficult task because direct evidence for carrier accumulation in semiconductors by Coulomb interactions is insufficient. Here, a sophisticated Hall measurement system is demonstrated to quantitatively analyze accumulated electron density&#8208;change inside the semiconductor depending on the ion&#8208;adsorption at the solid&#8211;liquid interface. Also, an enhanced EIS&#8208;structured device is designed in an aqueous&#8208;soaked system that works with the ionovoltaic principle to monitor the ion&#8208;dynamics in liquid electrolyte media, interestingly confirming ion&#8208;concentration dependence and ion&#8208;specificity by generated peak voltages. This newly introduced peculiar method contributes to an in&#8208;depth understanding of the ionovoltaic phenomena in terms of carrier actions in the semiconductors and ionic behaviors in the aqueous&#8208;bulk phases, providing informative analysis about interfacial adsorptions that can expand the scope of ion&#8208;sensing platforms.

         <title>Experimental Demonstration of Dual&#8208;Band Nano&#8208;Electromechanical Valley&#8208;Hall Topological Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new type of valley&#8208;Hall topological metamaterial is experimentally demonstrated on an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical platform. Backscattering&#8208;immune transport and valley&#8208;momentum locking effect are experimentally observed in the fundamental (&#8776;60 MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120 MHz) frequency bands. These nano&#8208;electromechanical metamaterials enable very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and open the door to experimental exploration of nonlinear topological mechanics at the nanoscale.








Abstract
Suppression of undesired backscattering of very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency elastic signals has been considered as a grand challenge in integrated phononic circuits. Originating from condensed&#8208;matter physics, valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators provide an intriguing strategy to overcome this challenge. To date, phononic valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators have been demonstrated only in bulk acoustic and mechanical systems operating at relatively low frequencies. Here, an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical valley&#8208;Hall topological insulator operating in the very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency regime is experimentally realized. Valley kink states that are backscattering&#8208;immune against sharp bends and exhibit the &#8220;valley&#8208;momentum locking&#8221; effect simultaneously in the fundamental (&#8776;60&#160;MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120&#160;MHz) frequency bands are demonstrated. It is further shown that the propagation directions of these dual&#8208;band valley kink states are always locked to their valley pseudospins. The results not only enable various applications in very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and capacity, but also open the door to experimental exploration of mechanical nonlinearities, particularly those involving the fundamental and second&#8208;order frequencies, in topologically nontrivial nanostructures.

&lt;p&gt;Suppression of undesired backscattering of very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency elastic signals has been considered as a grand challenge in integrated phononic circuits. Originating from condensed&#8208;matter physics, valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators provide an intriguing strategy to overcome this challenge. To date, phononic valley&#8208;Hall topological insulators have been demonstrated only in bulk acoustic and mechanical systems operating at relatively low frequencies. Here, an integrated nano&#8208;electromechanical valley&#8208;Hall topological insulator operating in the very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency regime is experimentally realized. Valley kink states that are backscattering&#8208;immune against sharp bends and exhibit the &#8220;valley&#8208;momentum locking&#8221; effect simultaneously in the fundamental (&#8776;60&#160;MHz) and second&#8208;order (&#8776;120&#160;MHz) frequency bands are demonstrated. It is further shown that the propagation directions of these dual&#8208;band valley kink states are always locked to their valley pseudospins. The results not only enable various applications in very&#8208;high&#8208;frequency integrated phononic circuits with enhanced robustness and capacity, but also open the door to experimental exploration of mechanical nonlinearities, particularly those involving the fundamental and second&#8208;order frequencies, in topologically nontrivial nanostructures.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Reprogramming the Tumor Microenvironment through Second&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared&#8208;Window Photothermal Genome Editing of PD&#8208;L1 Mediated by Supramolecular Gold Nanorods for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photothermal genome&#8208;editing strategy mediated by supramolecular gold nanorods is demonstrated to be effective for the disruption of PD&#8208;L1 of tumor cells, which can simultaneously induce the activation of T cells through immunogenic cell death. Therefore, the genomic disruption of PD&#8208;L1 greatly enables activated T cells to recognize and attack tumor cells under the reprogrammed immunoactive tumor microenvironment.








Abstract
A photothermal genome&#8208;editing strategy is described to improve immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy by CRISPR/Cas9&#8208;mediated disruption of PD&#8208;L1 and mild&#8208;hyperthermia&#8208;induced activation of immunogenic cell death (ICD). This strategy relies on a supramolecular cationic gold nanorod that not only serves as a carrier to deliver CRISPR/Cas9 targeting PD&#8208;L1, but also harvests the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;window (NIR&#8208;II) light and converts into mild hyperthermia to induce both ICD and gene expression of Cas9. The genomic disruption of PD&#8208;L1 significantly augments ICB therapy by improving the conversion of dendritic cells to T cells, followed by promoting the infiltration of cytotoxic T lymphocytes into tumors, thereby reprogramming immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment into immunoactive one. Such a therapeutic modality greatly inhibits the activity of primary and metastatic tumors and exhibits long&#8208;term immune memory effects against both rechallenged and recurrent tumors. The current therapeutic strategy for synergistic PD&#8208;L1 disruption and ICD activation represents an appealing way for cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Progress in Epitaxial Thin&#8208;Film Na3Bi as a Topological Electronic Material</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Na3Bi displays remarkable thickness&#8208;dependent properties, from bulk topological Dirac semimetal to wide&#8208;bandgap 2D topological insulator in ultrathin films with electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological switching. An overview of the recent progress on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area epitaxial films, and an outlook toward challenges and opportunities for applications to the next generation of topological electronic and spintronic devices.








Abstract
Trisodium bismuthide (Na3Bi) is the first experimentally verified topological Dirac semimetal, and is a 3D analogue of graphene hosting relativistic Dirac fermions. Its unconventional momentum&#8211;energy relationship is interesting from a fundamental perspective, yielding exciting physical properties such as chiral charge carriers, the chiral anomaly, and weak anti&#8208;localization. It also shows promise for realizing topological electronic devices such as topological transistors. Herein, an overview of the substantial progress achieved in the last few years on Na3Bi is presented, with a focus on technologically relevant large&#8208;area thin films synthesized via molecular beam epitaxy. Key theoretical aspects underpinning the unique electronic properties of Na3Bi are introduced. Next, the growth process on different substrates is reviewed. Spectroscopic and microscopic features are illustrated, and an analysis of semiclassical and quantum transport phenomena in different doping regimes is provided. The emergent properties arising from confinement in two dimensions, including thickness&#8208;dependent and electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven topological phase transitions, are addressed, with an outlook toward current challenges and expected future progress.

         <title>Intermediate&#8208;Adduct&#8208;Assisted Growth of Stable CsPbI2Br Inorganic Perovskite Films for High&#8208;Efficiency Semitransparent Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br is applied to prepare high&#8208;performance semitransparent perovskite solar cells (ST&#8208;PSCs). (Chloromethylene)&#8208;dimethylammonium chloride as an additive is introduced into the perovskite precursor to favor high&#8208;quality CsPbI2Br perovskite films. Through optimizing the perovskite film, interface, and electrode type, the efficiency of the ST&#8208;PSC reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an average visible transmittance (AVT) of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively.








Abstract
Thanks to the tunable bandgap and excellent photoelectric characteristics, perovskites have been widely used in semitransparent solar cells (ST&#8208;SCs). Most works present unsatisfactory power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) through reducing the thickness of the perovskite films because there is a trade&#8208;off between PCE and average visible transmittance (AVT). As a consequence, most PCEs are less than 12% when the AVT is higher than 20% due to the limited voltage (Voc) and short&#8208;circuit current (Jsc). Herein, a strategy of intermediate adduct (IMAT) engineering is developed to improve the film quality of the inorganic perovskite CsPbI2Br, which is a challenging issue to limit its performance of efficiency and stability. A normal n&#8211;i&#8211;p&#8208;structured PSC based on the optimal CsPbI2Br film delivers a PCE of 16.02% with excellent stability. Furthermore, through optimizing the electrode type and interface, the ST&#8208;PSC shows a high Voc larger than 1.2&#160;V and the PCE reaches 14.01% and 10.36% under an AVT of 31.7% and 40.9%, respectively. This is the first demonstration of a CsPbI2Br ST&#8208;PSC, and it outperforms most of other types of perovskites.

         <dc:description>
Nanocellulose aerogels are summarized in terms of their preparation methods, modification strategies, properties, and their inclusion in composites with various other compounds. Their applications with recent advancements in various fields are also presented. Finally, some conclusions and brief future prospects regarding nanocellulose aerogels are discussed.








Abstract
The rapid development of modern industry and excessive consumption of petroleum&#8208;based polymers have triggered a double crisis presenting a shortage of nonrenewable resources and environmental pollution. However, this has provided an opportunity to stimulate researchers to harness native biobased materials for novel advanced materials and applications. Nanocellulose&#8208;based aerogels, using abundant and sustainable cellulose as raw material, present a third&#8208;generation of aerogels that combine traditional aerogels with high porosity and large specific surface area, as well as the excellent properties of cellulose itself. Currently, nanocellulose aerogels provide a highly attention&#8208;catching platform for a wide range of functional applications in various fields, e.g., adsorption, separation, energy storage, thermal insulation, electromagnetic interference shielding, and biomedical applications. Here, the preparation methods, modification strategies, composite fabrications, and further applications of nanocellulose aerogels are summarized, with additional discussions regarding the prospects and potential challenges in future development.

         <title>Graphene: A Disruptive Opportunity for COVID&#8208;19 and Future Pandemics?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The present pandemic has motivated researchers with different backgrounds to fight against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Graphene&#8208;related materials present numerous benefits for new antiviral solutions. The interaction of graphene related materials with viruses, their virucidal activity, their possible use in antiviral coatings, and sensing devices for fast and reliable detection are highlighted.








Abstract
The graphene revolution, which has taken place during the last 15 years, has represented a paradigm shift for science. The extraordinary properties possessed by this unique material have paved the road to a number of applications in materials science, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. Graphene&#8208;related materials (GRMs) are now produced in large scale and have found niche applications also in the biomedical technologies, defining new standards for drug delivery and biosensing. Such advances position GRMs as novel tools to fight against the current COVID&#8208;19 and future pandemics. In this regard, GRMs can play a major role in sensing, as an active component in antiviral surfaces or in virucidal formulations. Herein, the most promising strategies reported in the literature on the use of GRM&#8208;based materials against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and other types of viruses are showcased, with a strong focus on the impact of functionalization, deposition techniques, and integration into devices and surface coatings.

     alt="Graphene: A Disruptive Opportunity for COVID&#8208;19 and Future Pandemics?"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The present pandemic has motivated researchers with different backgrounds to fight against SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2. Graphene&#8208;related materials present numerous benefits for new antiviral solutions. The interaction of graphene related materials with viruses, their virucidal activity, their possible use in antiviral coatings, and sensing devices for fast and reliable detection are highlighted.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The graphene revolution, which has taken place during the last 15 years, has represented a paradigm shift for science. The extraordinary properties possessed by this unique material have paved the road to a number of applications in materials science, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing. Graphene&#8208;related materials (GRMs) are now produced in large scale and have found niche applications also in the biomedical technologies, defining new standards for drug delivery and biosensing. Such advances position GRMs as novel tools to fight against the current COVID&#8208;19 and future pandemics. In this regard, GRMs can play a major role in sensing, as an active component in antiviral surfaces or in virucidal formulations. Herein, the most promising strategies reported in the literature on the use of GRM&#8208;based materials against the COVID&#8208;19 pandemic and other types of viruses are showcased, with a strong focus on the impact of functionalization, deposition techniques, and integration into devices and surface coatings.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Pseudosolvent Intercalator of Chitin: Self&#8208;Exfoliating into Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Thick Nanofibrils for Multifunctional Chitinous Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process that can circumvent strong mechanical disintegration is developed to extract chitin nanofibrils. Having controllable thickness down to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm and high aspect ratio up to 103, these ribbon&#8208;like nanofibrils can act as new building blocks to fabricate high&#8208;performance structural materials, being applicable in optics, wearable electronics, and energy devices.








Abstract
Traditionally, energy&#8208;intensive and time&#8208;consuming postmechanical disintegration processes are inevitable in extracting biopolymer nanofibrils from natural materials and thereby hinder their practical applications. Herein, a new, convenient, scalable, and energy&#8208;efficient method for exfoliating nanofibrils (ChNFs) from various chitin sources via pseudosolvent&#8208;assisted intercalation process is proposed. These self&#8208;exfoliated ChNFs possess controllable thickness from 2.2 to 0.8&#160;nm, average diameter of 4&#8211;5&#160;nm, high aspect ratio up to 103 and customized surface chemistries. Particularly, compared with elementary nanofibrils, ChNFs with few molecular layers thick exhibit greater potential to construct high&#8208;performance structural materials, e.g., ductile nanopapers with large elongation up to 70.1% and toughness as high as 30.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, as well as soft hydrogels with typical nonlinear elasticity mimicking that of human&#8208;skin. The proposed self&#8208;exfoliation concept with unique advantages in the combination of high yield, energy efficiency, scalable productivity, less equipment requirements, and mild conditions opens up a door to extract biopolymer nanofibrils on an industrial scale. Moreover, the present modular ChNFs exfoliation will facilitate researchers to study the effect of thickness on the properties of nanofibrils and provide more insight into the structure&#8211;function relationship of biopolymer&#8208;based materials.

         <title>Conformal Geometry and Multimaterial Additive Manufacturing through Freeform Transformation of Building Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new 3D printing process is reported that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation of individual build layers while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques. Individually manipulating each build layer within the sequential layered manufacturing process allows digital transformation of 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly; printing of conformal geometry to ensure custom fitting of vascular scaffolds; and realization of multiaxis, multimaterials 3D printing of soft robotic actuators.








Abstract
3D printing, formally known as additive manufacturing, creates complex geometries via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer addition of materials. While 3D printing has been historically perceived as the static addition of build layers, 3D printing is now considered as a dynamic assembly process. In this context, here a new 3D printing process is reported that executes full degree&#8208;of&#8208;freedom (DOF) transformation (translating, rotating, and scaling) of each individual building layer while utilizing continuous fabrication techniques. Transforming individual building layers within the sequential layered manufacturing process enables dynamic transformation of the 3D printed parts on&#8208;the&#8208;fly, eliminating the time&#8208;consuming redesign steps. Preserving the locality of the transformation to each layer further enables the discrete conformal transformation, allowing objects such as vascular scaffolds to be optimally fabricated to properly fit within specific patient anatomy obtained from the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements. Finally, exploiting the freedom to control the orientation of each individual building layer, multimaterials, multiaxis 3D printing capability are further established for integrating functional modules made of dissimilar materials in 3D printed devices. This final capability is demonstrated through 3D printing a soft pneumatic gripper via heterogenous integration of rigid base and soft actuating limbs.

         <title>Printable and Stretchable Giant Magnetoresistive Sensors for Highly Compliant and Skin&#8208;Conformal Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly compliant and printable giant magnetoresistive sensors reveal skin&#8208;conformability and excellent sensitivity to small magnetic fields because of highly sensitive giant magnetoresistive multilayers bound with sticky triblock copolymer, which is capable of on&#8208;skin interactive electronics for a touchless control of virtual objects.








Abstract
Highly compliant electronics, naturally conforming to human skin, represent a paradigm shift in the interplay with the surroundings. Solution&#8208;processable printing technologies are yet to be developed to comply with requirements to mechanical conformability of on&#8208;skin appliances. Here, it is demonstrated that high&#8208;performance spintronic elements can be printed on ultrathin 3 &#181;m thick polymeric foils enabling the mechanically imperceptible printed magnetoelectronics, which can adapt to the periodic buckling surface to be biaxially stretched over 100%. They constitute the first example of printed and stretchable giant magnetoresistive sensors, revealing 2 orders of magnitude improvements in mechanical stability and sensitivity at small magnetic fields, compared to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art printed magnetoelectronics. The key enabler of this performance enhancement is the use of elastomeric triblock copolymers as a binder for the magnetosensitive paste. Even when bent to a radius of 16&#160;&#181;m, the sensors printed on ultrathin foils remain intact and possess unmatched sensitivity for printed magnetoelectronics of 3&#160;T&#8208;1 in a low magnetic field of 0.88 mT. The compliant printed sensors can be used as components of on&#8208;skin interactive electronics as it is demonstrated with a touchless control of virtual objects including zooming in and out of interactive maps and scrolling through electronic documents.

         <title>Deep Cycling for High&#8208;Capacity Li&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Various electrochemical energy storage devices use movable ions in either the electrolyte or the electrodes for energy storage. A deep&#8208;cycling Li&#8208;ion battery that uses movable ions in both the electrolyte and the electrodes is developed, which offers opportunities to break the capacity limit of conventional rocking&#8208;chair Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
As the practical capacity of conventional Li&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) approaches the theoretical limit, which is determined by the rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture, a new cycling architecture with higher capacity is highly demanded for future development and electronic applications. Here, a deep&#8208;cycling architecture intrinsically with a higher theoretical capacity limit than conventional rocking&#8208;chair cycling architecture is developed, by introducing a follow&#8208;up cycling process to contribute more capacity. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture makes full use of movable ions in both of the electrolyte and electrodes for energy storage, rather than in either the electrolyte or the electrodes. Taking LiMn2O4&#8208;mesocarbon microbeads (MCMB)/Li cells as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, 57.7% more capacity is obtained. Moreover, the capacity retention is as high as 84.4% after 2000 charging/discharging cycles. The deep&#8208;cycling architecture offers opportunities to break the theoretical capacity limit of conventional LIBs and makes high demands for new&#8208;type of cathode materials, which will promote the development of next&#8208;generation energy storage devices.

         <title>A Biodegradable Secondary Battery and its Biodegradation Mechanism for Eco&#8208;Friendly Energy&#8208;Storage Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The environmental issues caused by the disposal of an increasing amount of used batteries have become a great challenge. A material and design strategy for a fully biodegradable rechargeable battery to address this concern is reported. A novel material&#8208;selection guideline and design rule provide a viable demonstration of a non&#8208;toxic and eco&#8208;friendly battery, which decomposes via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation.








Abstract
The production of rechargeable batteries is rapidly expanding, and there are going to be new challenges in the near future about how the potential environmental impact caused by the disposal of the large volume of the used batteries can be minimized. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to address these concerns by applying biodegradable device technology.

&lt;p&gt;The environmental issues caused by the disposal of an increasing amount of used batteries have become a great challenge. A material and design strategy for a fully biodegradable rechargeable battery to address this concern is reported. A novel material&#8208;selection guideline and design rule provide a viable demonstration of a non&#8208;toxic and eco&#8208;friendly battery, which decomposes via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The production of rechargeable batteries is rapidly expanding, and there are going to be new challenges in the near future about how the potential environmental impact caused by the disposal of the large volume of the used batteries can be minimized. Herein, a novel strategy is proposed to address these concerns by applying biodegradable device technology. An eco&#8208;friendly and biodegradable sodium&#8208;ion secondary battery (SIB) is developed through extensive material screening followed by the synthesis of biodegradable electrodes and their seamless assembly with an unconventional biodegradable separator, electrolyte, and package. Each battery component decomposes in nature into non&#8208;toxic compounds or elements via hydrolysis and/or fungal degradation, with all of the biodegradation products naturally abundant and eco&#8208;friendly. Detailed biodegradation mechanisms and toxicity influence of each component on living organisms are determined. In addition, this new SIB delivers performance comparable to that of conventional non&#8208;degradable SIBs. The strategy and findings suggest a novel eco&#8208;friendly biodegradable paradigm for large&#8208;scale rechargeable battery systems.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Soft Sensors: From Material Design to Implementation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The emerging field of self&#8208;healing soft sensing platforms is presented and discussed, while pointing out pathways to be followed by materials designers, synthetic chemists, and engineers for developing further high&#8208;performance and durable sensing devices.








Abstract
The demand for interfacing electronics in everyday life is rapidly accelerating, with an ever&#8208;growing number of applications in wearable electronics and electronic skins for robotics, prosthetics, and other purposes. Soft sensors that efficiently detect environmental or biological/physiological stimuli have been extensively studied due to their essential role in creating the necessary interfaces for these applications. Unfortunately, due to their natural softness, these sensors are highly sensitive to structural and mechanical damage. The integration of natural properties, such as self&#8208;healing, into these systems should improve their reliability, stability, and long&#8208;term performance. Recent studies on self&#8208;healing soft sensors for varying chemical and physical parameters are herein reviewed. In addition, contemporary studies on material design, device structure, and fabrication methods for sensing platforms are also discussed. Finally, the main challenges and future perspectives in this field are introduced, while focusing on the most promising examples and directions already reported.

         <title>Scalable Assembly of Flexible Ultrathin All&#8208;in&#8208;One Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries with Highly Stretchable, Editable, and Customizable Functions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A large&#8208;scale assembly strategy of flexible zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure is developed. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure endows the ZIBs with high flexibility and electrochemical performance as well as the ability to be tailored and edited into desired shapes and structures. Furthermore, they can be integrated with solar cells into an energy harvesting and storage integrated system.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are considered to be a promising candidate for flexible energy storage devices due to their high safety and low cost. However, the scalable assembly of flexible ZIBs is still a challenge. Here, a scalable assembly strategy is developed to fabricate flexible ZIBs with an ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one structure by combining blade coating with a rolling assembly process. Such a unique all&#8208;in&#8208;one integrated structure can effectively avoid the relative displacement or detachment between neighboring components to ensure continuous and effective ion&#8208; and/or loading&#8208;transfer capacity under external deformation, resulting in excellent structural and electrochemical stability. Furthermore, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs can be tailored and edited controllably into desired shapes and structures, further extending their editable, stretchable, and shape&#8208;customized functions. In addition, the ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one ZIBs display the ability to integrate with perovskite solar cells to achieve an energy harvesting and storage integrated system. These enlighten a broad area of flexible ZIBs to be compatible with highly flexible and wearable electronics. The scaling&#8208;up assembly strategy provides a route to design other ultrathin all&#8208;in&#8208;one energy storage devices with stretchable, editable, and customizable behaviors.

         <title>Epitaxial Ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 with Metallic Pyrochlore Oxide Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metallic pyrochlore oxide electrodes are&#160;introduced to create epitaxial&#160;Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 thin films. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Further tuning through such an epitaxial stabilization process can lead to the orthorhombic phase being stable over an even larger thickness range.








Abstract
The synthesis of fully epitaxial ferroelectric Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) thin films through the use of a conducting pyrochlore oxide electrode that acts as a structural and chemical template is reported. Such pyrochlores, exemplified by Pb2Ir2O7(PIO) and Bi2Ru2O7(BRO), exhibit metallic conductivity with room&#8208;temperature resistivity of &lt;1 m&#937; cm and are closely lattice matched to yttria&#8208;stabilized zirconia substrates as well as the HZO layers grown on top of them. Evidence for epitaxy and domain formation is established with X&#8208;ray diffraction and scanning transmission electron microscopy, which show that the c&#8208;axis of the HZO film is normal to the substrate surface. The emergence of the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase from the polar&#8208;orthorhombic phase is observed when the HZO film thickness is &#8805;&#8776;30&#160;nm. Thermodynamic analyses reveal the role of epitaxial strain and surface energy in stabilizing the polar phase as well as its coexistence with the non&#8208;polar&#8208;monoclinic phase as a function of film thickness.

         <title>Kirigami Engineering&#8212;Nanoscale Structures Exhibiting a Range of Controllable 3D Configurations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effect of the thickness of a single nanoscale 3D kirigami structure with two distinct out&#8208;of&#8208;plane tilting configurations is studied. The findings represent a new step in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a new degree of freedom to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures.








Abstract
Kirigami structures provide a promising approach to transform flat films into 3D complex structures that are difficult to achieve by conventional fabrication approaches. By designing the cutting geometry, it is shown that distinct buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations can be obtained, separated by a sharp transition characterized by a critical geometric dimension of the structures. In situ electron microscopy experiments reveal the effect of the ratio between the in&#8208;plane cut size and film thickness on out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations. Moreover, geometrically nonlinear finite element analyses (FEA) accurately predict the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane modes measured experimentally, their transition as a function of cut geometry, and provide the stress&#8211;strain response of the kirigami structures. The combined computational&#8211;experimental approach and results reported here represent a step forward in the characterization of thin films experiencing buckling&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane shape transformations and provide a path to control 3D configurations of micro&#8208; and nanoscale buckling&#8208;induced kirigami structures. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations promise great utility in the creation of micro&#8208; and nanoscale systems that can harness such structural behavior, such as optical scanning micromirrors, novel actuators, and nanorobotics. This work is of particular significance as the kirigami dimensions approach the sub&#8208;micrometer scale which is challenging to achieve with conventional micro&#8208;electromechanical system technologies.

         <title>Water&#8208;Surface Drag Coating: A New Route Toward High&#8208;Quality Conjugated Small&#8208;Molecule Thin Films with Enhanced Charge Transport Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel water&#8208;surface drag coating method is developed for large&#8208;area fabrication of high&#8208;quality conjugated small&#8208;molecule thin films with enhanced charge transport properties. 2,8&#8208;Difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are realized, showing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility compared to that of thin films fabricated by the conventional solution&#8208;coating method.








Abstract
Electronic properties of organic semiconductor (OSC) thin films are largely determined by their morphologies and crystallinities. However, solution&#8208;processed conjugated small&#8208;molecule OSC thin films usually exhibit abundant grain boundaries and impure grain orientations because of complex fluid dynamics during solution coating. Here, a novel methodology, water&#8208;surface drag coating, is demonstrated to fabricate high&#8208;quality OSC thin films with greatly enhanced charge transport properties. This method utilizes the water surface to alter the evaporation dynamics of solution to enlarge the grain size, and a unique drag&#8208;coating process to achieve the unidirectional growth of organic crystals. Using 2,8&#8208;difluoro&#8208;5,11&#8208;bis(triethylsilylethynyl)anthradithiophene (Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT) as an example, thin films with millimeter&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal domains and pure crystallographic orientations are achieved, revealing a significant enhancement (4.7 times) of carrier mobility. More importantly, the resulting film can be directly transferred onto any desired flexible substrates, and flexible transistors based on the Dif&#8208;TES&#8208;ADT thin films show a mobility as high as 16.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, which represents the highest mobility value for the flexible transistors reported thus far. The method is general for the growth of various high&#8208;quality OSC thin films, thus opening up opportunities for high&#8208;performance organic flexible electronics.

         <title>Light&#8208;Activated Stress Relaxation, Toughness Improvement, and Photoinduced Reversal of Physical Aging in Glassy Polymer Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) moieties are introduced into glassy copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) networks to promote spatiotemporally controlled dynamic bond exchange in the glassy state. As a result, unprecedented levels of stress relaxation, extended plastic deformation post yielding, and intriguing rejuvenation of mechanical properties in physically aged samples are achieved by activation of RAFT in the glassy state.








Abstract
A covalent adaptable network (CAN) with high glass transition temperature (Tg), superior mechanical properties including toughness and ductility, and unprecedented spatio&#8208;temporally controlled dynamic behavior is prepared by introducing dynamic moieties capable of reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) into photoinitiated copper(I)&#8208;catalyzed azide&#8211;alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC)&#8208;based networks. While the CuAAC polymerization yields glassy polymers composed of rigid triazole linkages with enhanced toughness, the RAFT moieties undergo bond exchange leading to stress relaxation upon light exposure. This unprecedented level of stress relaxation in the glassy state leads to numerous desirable attributes including glassy state photoinduced plasticity, toughness improvement during large deformation, and even photoinduced reversal of the effects of physical aging resulting in the rejuvenation of mechanical and thermodynamic properties in physically aged RAFT&#8208;CuAAC networks that undergo bond exchange in the glassy state. Surprisingly, when an allyl&#8208;sulfide&#8208;containing azide monomer (AS&#8208;N3) is used to form the network, the network exhibits up to 80% stress relaxation in the glassy state (Tg&#160;&#8722; 45 &#176;C) under fixed displacement. In situ activation of RAFT during mechanical loading results in a 50% improvement in elongation to break and 40% improvement in the toughness when compared to the same network without light&#8208;activation of RAFT during the tensile testing.

         <title>Ultrasonic Interfacial Engineering of Red Phosphorous&#8211;Metal for Eradicating MRSA Infection Effectively</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A controllable sonothermal ability can be realized through interfacial engineering by constructing heterojunction interfaces between red phosphorous and metals (Ti, V, Cr, Fe, Co, and Ni). Ultrasound&#8208;excited electrons convert ultrasonic energy into heat through vibration, relaxation, and recombination in the heterointerface. Multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus can be eradicated efficiently by sonothermal effect and with thermally controlled release of nitric oxide gas.








Abstract
Sonodynamic therapy (SDT) is considered to be a potential treatment for various diseases including cancers and bacterial infections due to its deep penetration ability and biosafety, but its SDT efficiency is limited by the hypoxia environment of deep tissues. This study proposes creating a potential solution, sonothermal therapy, by developing the ultrasonic interfacial engineering of metal&#8211;red phosphorus (RP), which has an obviously improved sonothermal ability of more than 20 &#176;C elevation under 25 min of continuous ultrasound (US) excitation as compared to metal alone. The underlying mechanism is that the mechanical energy of the US activates the motion of the interfacial electrons. US&#8208;induced electron motion in the RP can efficiently transfer the US energy into phonons in the forms of heat and lattice vibrations, resulting in a stronger US absorption of metal&#8211;RP. Unlike the nonspecific heating of the cavitation effect induced by US, titanium&#8211;RP can be heated in situ when the US penetrates through 2.5&#160;cm of pork tissue. In addition, through a sonothermal treatment in vivo, bone infection induced by multidrug&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is successfully eliminated in under 20 min of US without tissue damage. This work provides a new strategy for combating MRSA by strong sonothermal therapy through US interfacial engineering.

         <title>Redox Targeting&#8208;Based Thermally Regenerative Electrochemical Cycle Flow Cell for Enhanced Low&#8208;Grade Heat Harnessing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle flow cell, via the RT&#8208;reactions between redox mediators and solid materials, is reported. The combined advantages of redox flow batteries and static batteries are demonstrated for enhanced thermoelectric energy conversion and decoupled high&#8208;energy&#8208;density large&#8208;scale electricity storage.








Abstract
A large amount of low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;100&#160;&#176;C) is produced in electrical devices and mostly wasted. This type of heat without effective dissipation also causes compromised device performance, reliability, and lifespan. To tackle these issues, a redox targeting (RT)&#8208;based flow cell with judiciously designed thermoelectrically active redox materials is demonstrated for the first time for efficient heat&#8208;to&#8208;electricity conversion through a thermally regenerative electrochemical cycle (TREC). Compared with the conventional TREC systems, the RT&#8208;based flow cell not only reveals considerably enhanced thermoelectric efficiency, but the flow of redox fluids also provides a cooling function to the system. In this work, solid material Ni0.2Co0.8(OH)2 and redox mediator [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;, both of which have negative temperature coefficient and share identical redox potential, are paired via RT&#8208;reactions to boost the capacity and meanwhile thermoelectric efficiency of a [Fe(CN)6]4&#8722;/3&#8722;/Zn0/2+&#8208;based flow cell. Upon operating over the TREC cycle, the RT&#8208;based flow cell converts heat to electricity at an unprecedented absolute thermoelectric efficiency of 3.61% in the temperature range of 25&#8211;55&#160;&#176;C.

Through injection of hydrogen atoms into grain boundaries, the coercivity of a Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnet is tuned by &#8776;1.3 T by applying &#8776;1 V. This work not only offers an effective route to achieve giant magnetoelectric effects in metallic ferromagnets, but also unveils the neglected critical role of grain boundaries in determining the coercivity of pinning&#8208;type magnets.








Abstract
Pinning&#8208;type magnets with high coercivity at high temperatures are at the core of thriving clean&#8208;energy technologies. Among these, Sm2Co17&#8208;based magnets are excellent candidates owing to their high&#8208;temperature stability. However, despite intensive efforts to optimize the intragranular microstructure, the coercivity currently only reaches 20&#8211;30% of the theoretical limits. Here, the roles of the grain&#8208;interior nanostructure and the grain boundaries in controlling coercivity are disentangled by an emerging magnetoelectric approach. Through hydrogen charging/discharging by applying voltages of only &#8776;1&#160;V, the coercivity is reversibly tuned by an unprecedented value of &#8776;1.3 T. In situ magneto&#8208;structural characterization and atomic&#8208;scale tracking of hydrogen atoms reveal that the segregation of hydrogen atoms at the grain boundaries, rather than the change of the crystal structure, dominates the reversible and substantial change of coercivity. Hydrogen reduces the local magnetocrystalline anisotropy and facilitates the magnetization reversal starting from the grain boundaries. This study opens a way to achieve the giant magnetoelectric effect in permanent magnets by engineering grain boundaries with hydrogen atoms. Furthermore, it reveals the so far neglected critical role of grain boundaries in the conventional magnetization&#8208;switching paradigm of pinning&#8208;type magnets, suggesting a critical reconsideration of engineering strategies to overcome the coercivity limits.

         <title>Tunable Photocontrolled Motions of Anil&#8208;Poly(ethylene terephthalate) Systems through Excited&#8208;State Intramolecular Proton Transfer and Trans&#8211;Cis Isomerization</title>

         <dc:description>
Multiple photoresponsive motions, excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer, and trans&#8211;cis isomerization, are combined into anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems to achieve photocontrolled function with the aid of a stretching process. The relationship between molecular structure and photodeformation property is investigated, to provide efficient strategies of molecular design for the further development of photoresponsive materials.








Abstract
With the combination of excited&#8208;state intramolecular proton transfer and trans&#8211;cis isomerization as microscopic molecular motions under light stimulus, multiple photodeformable processes are achieved in anil&#8208;poly(ethylene terephthalate) systems, including simple bending, dancing butterflies, and switches. The doping films can realize light&#8208;driven contraction as large as 70% and bending angle of about 141&#176;, upon a simple stretching process. The internal mechanism is confirmed by transient absorption spectra, and the relationship between molecular structure and photocontrolled motion is investigated by theoretical calculations and crystal analysis. This work provides a convenient approach by utilizing anils to fabricate reversible actuations with desirable geometries, greatly contributing to the applications and manufacturing of soft robots and related research.

         <title>Quantum Rescaling, Domain Metastability, and Hybrid Domain&#8208;Walls in 2D CrI3 Magnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in nanomagnets. However, it is unclear whether they are important in recently discovered 2D magnets. It is shown that biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling corrections are the keys to the long&#8208;range ordering of 2D CrI3 layers. Metastability induces domain walls of hybrid types with different chirality.








Abstract
Higher&#8208;order exchange interactions and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in describing the properties of low&#8208;dimensional magnetic compounds. Here, the recently discovered 2D van der Waals (vdW) CrI3 is identified as a quantum non&#8208;Heisenberg material with properties far beyond an Ising magnet as initially assumed. It is found that biquadratic exchange interactions are essential to quantitatively describe the magnetism of CrI3 but quantum rescaling corrections are required to reproduce its thermal properties. The quantum nature of the heat bath represented by discrete electron&#8211;spin and phonon&#8211;spin scattering processes induces the formation of spin fluctuations in the low&#8208;temperature regime. These fluctuations induce the formation of metastable magnetic domains evolving into a single macroscopic magnetization or even a monodomain over surface areas of a few micrometers. Such domains display hybrid characteristics of N&#233;el and Bloch types with a narrow domain wall width in the range of 3&#8211;5 nm. Similar behavior is expected for the majority of 2D vdW magnets where higher&#8208;order exchange interactions are appreciable.

         <title>A High&#8208;Performance Lithium Metal Battery with Ion&#8208;Selective Nanofluidic Transport in a Conjugated Microporous Polymer Protective Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous polymers are developed as protective layers for lithium anodes to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries with a long cycle life. A pouch cell fabricated using CMP&#8208;modified lithium foil achieves an energy density exceeding 400 Wh kg&#8722;1 and cycle stability &gt;65 cycles.








Abstract
Lithium metal is the &#8220;holy grail&#8221; of anodes, capable of unlocking the full potential of cathodes in next&#8208;generation batteries. However, the use of pure lithium anodes faces several challenges in terms of safety, cycle life, and rate capability. Herein, a solution&#8208;processable conjugated microporous thermosetting polymer (CMP) is developed. The CMP can be further converted into a large&#8208;scale membrane with nanofluidic channels (5&#8211;6 &#197;). These channels can serve as facile and selective Li&#8208;ion diffusion pathways on the surfaces of lithium anodes, thereby ensuring stable lithium stripping/plating even at high areal current densities. CMP&#8208;modified lithium anodes (CMP&#8208;Li) exhibit cycle stability of 2550 h at an areal current density of 20 mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, CMP is readily amenable to solution&#8208;processing and spray coating, rendering it highly applicable to continuous roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll lithium metal treatment processes. Pouch cells with CMP&#8208;Li as the anode and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) as the cathode exhibits a stable energy density of 400 Wh kg&#8722;1.

         <title>A Monochloro Copper Phthalocyanine Memristor with High&#8208;Temperature Resilience for Electronic Synapse Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic memristor using small&#8208;molecule monochloro copper phthalocyanine as the active material is developed. The unencapsulated memristive devices exhibit high thermal resilience at 300 &#176;C, good flexibility, and high capability of simulating a variety of functions of biological synapses. This work offers an effective approach toward the implementation of brain&#8211;computer interface technology for high&#8208;temperature applications.








Abstract
Memristors are considered to be one of the most promising device concepts for neuromorphic computing, in particular thanks to their highly tunable resistive states. To realize neuromorphic computing architectures, the assembly of large memristive crossbar arrays is necessary, but is often accompanied by severe heat dispassion. Organic materials can be tailored with on&#8208;demand electronic properties in the context of neuromorphic applications. However, such materials are more susceptible to heat, and detrimental effects such as thermally induced degradation directly lead to failure of device operation. Here, an organic memristive synapse formed of monochloro copper phthalocyanine, which remains operational and capable of memristive switching at temperatures as high as 300 &#176;C in ambient air without any encapsulation, is demonstrated. The change in the electrical conductance is found to be a result of ion movement, closely resembling what takes place in biological neurons. Furthermore, the high viability of this approach is showcased by demonstrating flexible memristors with stable switching behaviors after repeated mechanical bending as well as organic synapses capable of emulating a trainable and reconfigurable memristor array for image information processing. The results set a precedent for thermally resilient organic synapses to impact organic neuromorphic devices in progressing their practicality.

However, such materials are more susceptible to heat, and detrimental effects such as thermally induced degradation directly lead to failure of device operation. Here, an organic memristive synapse formed of monochloro copper phthalocyanine, which remains operational and capable of memristive switching at temperatures as high as 300 &#176;C in ambient air without any encapsulation, is demonstrated. The change in the electrical conductance is found to be a result of ion movement, closely resembling what takes place in biological neurons. Furthermore, the high viability of this approach is showcased by demonstrating flexible memristors with stable switching behaviors after repeated mechanical bending as well as organic synapses capable of emulating a trainable and reconfigurable memristor array for image information processing. The results set a precedent for thermally resilient organic synapses to impact organic neuromorphic devices in progressing their practicality.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Tunnel Intergrowth LixMnO2 Nanosheet Arrays as 3D Cathode for High&#8208;Performance All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Thin Film Lithium Microbatteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunnel intergrowth LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels are developed by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at a low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Benefiting from the stable tunnel structure for the cathode and favorable architecture with abundant 3D cathode/electrolyte interface, the constructed LixMnO2/LiPON/Li thin&#8208;film battery achieves large specific capacity and outstanding cycle life.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state thin film lithium batteries (TFBs) are proposed as the ideal power sources for microelectronic devices. However, the high&#8208;temperature (&gt;500 &#176;C) annealing process of cathode films, such as LiCoO2 and LiMn2O4, restricts the on&#8208;chip integration and potential applications of TFBs. Herein, tunnel structured LixMnO2 nanosheet arrays are fabricated as 3D cathode for TFBs by a facile electrolyte Li+ ion infusion method at very low temperature of 180 &#176;C. Featuring an interesting tunnel intergrowth structure consisting of alternating 1 &#215; 3 and 1 &#215; 2 tunnels, the LixMnO2 cathode shows high specific capacity with good structural stability between 2.0 and 4.3 V (vs. Li+/Li). By utilizing the 3D LixMnO2 cathode, all&#8208;solid&#8208;state LixMnO2/LiPON/Li TFB (3DLMO&#8208;TFB) has been successfully constructed with prominent advantages of greatly enriched cathode/electrolyte interface and shortened Li+ diffusion length in the 3D structure. Consequently, the 3DLMO&#8208;TFB device exhibits large specific capacity (185 mAh g&#8722;1 at 50 mA g&#8722;1), good rate performance, and excellent cycle performance (81.3% capacity retention after 1000 cycles), outperforming the TFBs using spinel LiMn2O4 thin film cathodes fabricated at high temperature. Importantly, the low&#8208;temperature preparation of high&#8208;performance cathode film enables the fabrication of TFBs on various rigid and flexible substrates, which could greatly expand their potential applications in microelectronics.

         <title>Electrochemiluminescent Transistors: A New Strategy toward Light&#8208;Emitting Switching Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electrochemiluminescent (ECL)&#8208;principle&#8208;based approach to demonstrate high&#8208;performance light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) is introduced. Exploiting a solid electrolyte with an ECL luminophore (ECL Gel) as a gate insulator, p&#8208;, n&#8208;, and ambipolar LETs are successfully realized. Not only light&#8208;emitting materials, but conventional semiconductors can be employed for high&#8208;mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission, providing new opportunities for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting transistors (LETs) have attracted a significant amount of interest as multifunctional building blocks for next&#8208;generation electronics and optoelectronic devices. However, it is challenging to obtain LETs with a high carrier mobility and uniform light&#8208;emission because the semiconductor channel should provide both the electrical charge transport and optical light&#8208;emission, and typical emissive semiconductors have low, imbalanced carrier mobilities. In this work, a novel device platform that adapts the electrochemiluminescence (ECL) principle in LETs, referred to as an ECL transistor (ECLT) is proposed. ECL is a light&#8208;emission phenomenon from electrochemically excited luminophores generated by redox reactions. A solid&#8208;state ECL electrolyte consisting of a network&#8208;forming polymer, ionic liquid, luminophore, and co&#8208;reactant is employed as the light&#8208;emitting gate insulator of the ECLT. Based on this construction, high&#8208;performance LETs that make use of various conventional non&#8208;emissive semiconductors (e.g., poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene), zinc oxide, and reduced graphene oxide) are successfully demonstrated. All the devices exhibit a high mobility (0.9&#8211;10 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1) and a uniform light&#8208;emission. This innovative approach demonstrates a novel LET platform and provides a promising pathway to achieve significant breakthroughs to develop electronic circuits and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Selective Ethanol Oxidation Reaction at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface can be used as a highly active and selective site for ethanol oxidation to form CO2, where the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly facilitates both electron transfer from the Rh to the Sn species and oxidation of the poisonous intermediates, leading to improved selectivity to the C1 pathway and excellent durability for the ethanol oxidation reaction.








Abstract
Direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs) are regarded as an attractive power source with high energy density, bio&#8208;renewability, and convenient storage and transportation. However, the anodic reaction of DEFCs, that is, the ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR), suffers from poor efficiency due to the low selectivity to CO2 (C1 pathway) and high selectivity to CH3COOH (C2 pathway). In this study, the selective EOR to CO2 can be achieved at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface in SnO2&#8211;Rh nanosheets (NSs). The optimized catalyst of 0.2SnO2&#8211;Rh NSs/C exhibits excellent alkaline EOR performance with a mass activity of 213.2 mA mgRh&#8722;1 and a Faraday efficiency of 72.8% for the C1 pathway, which are 1.7 and 1.9 times higher than those of Rh NSs/C. Mechanism studies indicate that the strong synergy at the Rh&#8211;SnO2 interface significantly promotes the breaking of C&#63743;C bond of C2H5OH to form CO2, and facilitates oxidation of the poisonous intermediates (*CO and *CH3) to suppress the deactivation of the catalyst. This work not only provides a highly selective, active, and stable catalyst for the EOR, but also promotes fundamental research for the design of efficient catalysts via interface modification.

         <title>Anharmonicity&#8208;Driven Rashba Cohelical Excitons Break Quantum Efficiency Limitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An emission mechanism of lead halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is revealed in which A&#8208;site cation disorder caused by unstable non&#8208;centrosymmetric vibrations plays a crucial role. The subsequent disorder of the A&#8208;site cation leads to Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and the lowest&#8208;lying bright cohelical exciton state. This allows for PeLEDs to overcome the internal 25% efficiency limitation of closed&#8208;shell LEDs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;shell light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX3 (A&#160;=&#160;Cs/CN2H5; X&#160;=&#160;Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed&#8208;shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive J&#160;=&#160;0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital&#8208;bonding network along the imaginary A+&#8230;X&#8722;(T1u) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling (RD&#8208;SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many&#8208;body theory and first&#8208;principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD&#8208;SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25% IQE limitation for closed&#8208;shell LEDs.

     alt="Anharmonicity&#8208;Driven Rashba Cohelical Excitons Break Quantum Efficiency Limitation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An emission mechanism of lead halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) is revealed in which A&#8208;site cation disorder caused by unstable non&#8208;centrosymmetric vibrations plays a crucial role. The subsequent disorder of the A&#8208;site cation leads to Rashba spin&#8211;orbit coupling and the lowest&#8208;lying bright cohelical exciton state. This allows for PeLEDs to overcome the internal 25% efficiency limitation of closed&#8208;shell LEDs.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Closed&#8208;shell light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) suffer from the internal quantum efficiency (IQE) limitation imposed by optically inactive triplet excitons. Here, an unrevealed emission mechanism of lead halide perovskites (LHPs) APbX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (A&#160;=&#160;Cs/CN&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;; X&#160;=&#160;Cl/Br/I) that circumvents the efficiency limit of closed&#8208;shell LEDs is explored. Though efficient emission is prohibited by optically inactive &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;&#160;=&#160;0 in inversion symmetric LHPs, the anharmonicity arising from stereochemistry of Pb and resonant orbital&#8208;bonding network along the imaginary A&lt;sup&gt;+&#8230;&lt;/sup&gt;X&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;(T&lt;sub&gt;1u&lt;/sub&gt;) transverse optical (TO) modes, breaks inversion symmetry, introducing disorder and Rashba&#8211;Dresselhaus spin&#8208;orbit coupling (RD&#8208;SOC). This results in bright cohelical and dark antihelical excitons. Many&#8208;body theory and first&#8208;principles calculations show that the optically active cohelical exciton is the lowest excited state in organic/inorganic LHPs. Thus, RD&#8208;SOC can drive to achieve the ideal 50% IQE by utilizing anharmonicity, much over the 25% IQE limitation for closed&#8208;shell LEDs.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Extremely Fast Optical and Nonvolatile Control of Mixed&#8208;Phase Multiferroic BiFeO3 via Instantaneous Strain Perturbation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
All&#8208;optical manipulation of the complex phases and domain structures in multiferroic BiFeO3 thin films on ultrafast timescale is demonstrated by adoption of extremely short light pulses. The configuration of large&#8208;area optically written domains can be controlled by tuning the competing elastic and electrostatic energies. These results offer a novel route for the development of all&#8208;optical switchable devices and high&#8208;speed multifunctional optoelectronics.








Abstract
Multiferroics&#8212;materials that exhibit coupled ferroic orders&#8212;are considered to be one of the most promising candidate material systems for next&#8208;generation spintronics, memory, low&#8208;power nanoelectronics and so on. To advance potential applications, approaches that lead to persistent and extremely fast functional property changes are in demand. Herein, it is revealed that the phase transition and the correlated ferroic orders in multiferroic BiFeO3 (BFO) can be modulated via illumination of single short/ultrashort light pulses. Heat transport simulations and ultrafast optical pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy reveal that the transient strain induced by light pulses plays a key role in determining the persistent final states. Having identified the diffusionless phase transformation features via scanning transmission electron microscopy, sequential laser pulse illumination is further demonstrated to perform large&#8208;area phase and domain manipulation in a deterministic way. The work contributes to all&#8208;optical and rapid nonvolatile control of multiferroicity, offering different routes while designing novel optoelectronics.

         <title>Direct Magnetic Reinforcement of Electrocatalytic ORR/OER with Electromagnetic Induction of Magnetic Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An external magnetic field increases the probability of spin polarization of magnetic metal nanoparticles and thus can enhance their oxygen reduction and evolution reaction (ORR/OER) catalytic activity. In this work, carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalysts of magnetic catalytic nanocages are fabricated by uniformly embedding cobalt nanoparticles into macroporous carbon nanofibers. The direct magnetic enhancement is verified by investigating the electrocatalytic ORR/OER performance under an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Designing stable and efficient electrocatalysts for both oxygen reduction and evolution reactions (ORR/OER) at low&#8208;cost is challenging. Here, a carbon&#8208;based bifunctional catalyst of magnetic catalytic nanocages that can direct enhance the oxygen catalytic activity by simply applying a moderate (350 mT) magnetic field is reported. The catalysts, with high porosity of 90% and conductivity of 905 S m&#8722;1, are created by in situ doping metallic cobalt nanodots (&#8776;10&#160;nm) into macroporous carbon nanofibers with a facile electrospinning method. An external magnetic field makes the cobalt magnetized into nanomagnets with high spin polarization, which promote the adsorption of oxygen&#8208;intermediates and electron transfer, significantly improving the catalytic efficiency. Impressively, the half wave&#8208;potential is increased by 20&#160;mV for ORR, and the overpotential at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is decreased by 15&#160;mV for OER. Compared with the commercial Pt/C+IrO2 catalysts, the magnetic catalyzed Zn&#8211;air batteries deliver 2.5&#8208;fold of capacities and exhibit much longer durability over 155 h. The findings point out a very promising strategy of using electromagnetic induction to boost oxygen catalytic activity.

         <title>Mapping of Texture and Phase Fractions in Heterogeneous Stress States during Multiaxial Loading of Biomedical Superelastic NiTi</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multi&#8208;axial loading and heating. The similarity in R&#8208;phase variant behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading, is discussed along with its ability to accommodate the resulting stress and strain mismatch.








Abstract
Thermoelastic deformation mechanisms in polycrystalline biomedical&#8208;grade superelastic NiTi are spatially mapped using in situ neutron diffraction during multiaxial loading and heating. The trigonal R&#8208;phase is formed from the cubic phase during cooling to room temperature and subsequently deforms in compression, tension, and torsion. The resulting R&#8208;phase variant microstructure from the variant reorientation and detwinning processes are equivalent for the corresponding strain in tension and compression, and the variant microstructure is reversible by isothermal loading. The R&#8208;phase variant microstructure is consistent between uniaxial and torsional loading when the principal stress directions of the stress state are considered (for the crystallographic directions observed here). The variant microstructure evolution is tracked and the similarity in general behavior between uniaxial and torsional loading, in spite of the implicit heterogeneous stress state associated with torsional loading, pointed to the ability of the reversible thermoelastic transformation in NiTi to accommodate stress and strain mismatch with deformation. This ability of the R&#8208;phase, despite its limited variants, to accommodate stress and strain and satisfy strain incompatibility in addition to the existing internal stresses has significance for reducing irrecoverable deformation mechanisms during loading and cycling through the phase transformation.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence Enabled through Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Nanocomposite Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general and facile self&#8208;assembly strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), based on nacre&#8208;mimetic nanocomposite design is proposed. The laminated nanoclay endows the films with tunable oxygen permeability, and programmable retention times of RTP signals can be achieved. Applications including oxygen sensors and photolithographic RTP tags, and a new anti&#8208;interception concept are demonstrated.








Abstract
A generic, facile, and waterborne strategy is introduced to fabricate flexible, low&#8208;cost nanocomposite films with room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) by incorporating waterborne RTP polymers into self&#8208;assembled bioinspired polymer/nanoclay nanocomposites. The excellent oxygen barrier of the lamellar nanoclay structure suppresses the quenching effect from ambient oxygen (kq) and broadens the choice of polymer matrices towards lower glass transition temperature (Tg), while providing better mechanical properties and processability. Moreover, the oxygen permeation and diffusion inside the films can be fine&#8208;tuned by varying the polymer/nanoclay ratio, enabling programmable retention times of the RTP signals, which is exploited for transient information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials. Additionally, anti&#8208;interception materials are showcased by tracing the interception&#8208;induced oxygen history that interferes with the preset self&#8208;erasing time. Merging bioinspired nanocomposite design with RTP materials contributes to overcoming the inherent limitations of molecular design of organic RTP compounds, and allows programmable temporal features to be added into RTP materials by controlled mesostructures. This will assist in paving the way for practical applications of RTP materials as novel anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials.

         <title>Finding the Next Superhard Material through Ensemble Learning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method capable of finding new superhard materials is constructed by directly predicting the experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. The model is then used to conduct high&#8208;throughput screening of crystal databases and machine&#8208;learning generated phase diagrams to suggest undiscovered superhard materials.








Abstract
An ensemble machine&#8208;learning method is demonstrated to be capable of finding superhard materials by directly predicting the load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on the chemical composition. A total of 1062 experimentally measured load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness data are extracted from the literature and used to train a supervised machine&#8208;learning algorithm utilizing boosting, achieving excellent accuracy (R2&#160;= 0.97). This new model is then tested by synthesizing and measuring the load&#8208;dependent hardness of several unreported disilicides and analyzing the predicted hardness of several classic superhard materials. The trained ensemble method is then employed to screen for superhard materials by examining more than 66&#8201;000 compounds in crystal structure databases, which show that 68 known materials have a Vickers hardness &#8805;40 GPa at 0.5 N (applied force) and only 10 exceed this mark at 5 N. The hardness model is then combined with the data&#8208;driven phase diagram generation tool to expand the limited number of reported high hardness compounds. Eleven ternary borocarbide phase spaces are studied, and more than ten thermodynamically favorable compositions with a hardness above 40 GPa (at 0.5 N) are identified, proving this ensemble model's ability to find previously unknown materials with outstanding mechanical&#160;properties.

         <title>Deep&#8208;Blue Perovskite Single&#8208;Mode Lasing through Efficient Vapor&#8208;Assisted Chlorination</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;blue laser sources are of interest in lithography, microscopy, and medical and scientific devices; and lasers have, until now, been limited to bulky gas laser systems and III&#8211;V semiconductor devices. A new strategy to achieve deep&#8208;blue emitting perovskite films, and the prospect of extending the range of deep&#8208;blue/near&#8208;UV laser sources are reported.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for solution&#8208;processed laser gain materials, with impressive performance in the green and red spectral regions. Despite exciting progress, deep&#8208;blue&#8212;an important wavelength for laser applications&#8212;remains underexplored; indeed, cavity integration and single&#8208;mode lasing from large&#8208;bandgap perovskites have yet to be achieved. Here,&#160;a vapor&#8208;assisted chlorination strategy that enables synthesis of low&#8208;dimensional CsPbCl3&#160;thin films exhibiting deep&#8208;blue emission is reported. Using this approach,&#160; high&#8208;quality perovskite thin films having a low surface roughness (RMS &#8776; 1.3&#160;nm) and efficient charge transfer properties are achieved. These enable us to document low&#8208;threshold amplified spontaneous emission. Levering the high quality of the gain medium,&#160; vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers with a low lasing threshold of 6.5 &#181;J cm&#8722;2&#160;are fabricated. This report of deep&#8208;blue perovskite single&#8208;mode lasing showcases the prospect of increasing the range of deep&#8208;blue laser sources.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2005275, Horacio D. Espinosa,  Daniel Lopez, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate the engineering of nanoscale kirigami structures exhibiting a range of buckling&#8208;induced controllable 3D configurations. By combining nanomanufacturing, in situ microscopy experimentation, and computational modeling, symmetric and asymmetric 3D configurations relevant to numerous applications are demonstrated, including kirigami&#8208;based soft nanogrippers (robotics), light modulation, deformable electronics, and tunable metamaterials.

         <dc:description>
In article number 2005112, Jakoah Brgoch and co&#8208;workers establish an ensemble machine&#8208;learning method to find new superhard materials. The model is trained on the sparse experimental data available in the literature to predict load&#8208;dependent Vickers hardness based only on chemical composition. Crystal&#8208;structure databases and unknown phase diagrams are then screened in search of novel materials with an outstanding mechanical response.

         <dc:description>
Higher&#8208;order exchange and quantum effects are widely known to play an important role in the properties of nanomagnets. In article number 2004138, Elton J. G. Santos and co&#8208;workers show that recently discovered two&#8208;dimensional CrI3 magnets require biquadratic exchange interactions and quantum&#8208;rescaling to describe their long&#8208;range ordering. Metastability of the magnetic domains induces domain walls with different chirality, which is important for the new generation of quantum&#8208;materials&#8208;based technologies.

In article number 2005456, Keun Hyung Lee, Kihyon Hong, and co&#8208;workers introduce a new concept of light&#8208;emitting transistors based on the principle of electrochemiluminescence. An ion&#8208;conductive solid&#8208;state ECL electrolyte is utilized in electrochemiluminescent transistors as a gate insulator for charge accumulation and light emission. Owing to the unique electrical and optical features of the electrochemiluminescent material, the devices exhibit not only excellent electrical properties, but also uniform light emission. This concept can be a new path toward advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Design of Local Atomic Environments in Single&#8208;Atom Electrocatalysts for Renewable Energy Conversions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rich variety of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates vast opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance renewable energy conversion.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom electrocatalysts (SAECs) have recently attracted tremendous research interest due to their often remarkable catalytic responses, unmatched by conventional catalysts. The electrocatalytic performance of SAECs is closely related to the specific metal species and their local atomic environments, including their coordination number, the determined structure of the coordination sites, and the chemical identity of nearest and second nearest neighboring atoms. The wide range of distinct chemical bonding configurations of a single&#8208;metal atom with its surrounding host atoms creates virtually limitless opportunities for the rational design and synthesis of SAECs with tunable local atomic environment for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis. In this review, the authors first identify fundamental hurdles in electrochemical conversions and highlight the relevance of SAECs. They then critically examine the role of the local atomic structures, encompassing the first and second coordination spheres of the isolated metal atoms, on the design of high&#8208;performance SAECs. The relevance of single&#8208;atom dopants for host activation is also discussed. Insights into the correlation between local structures of SAECs and their catalytic response are analyzed and discussed. Finally, the authors summarize major challenges to be addressed in the field of SAECs and provide some perspectives in the rational construction of superior SAECs for a wide range of electrochemical conversions.

         <title>Biomaterials and 3D Bioprinting Strategies to Model Glioblastoma and the Blood&#8211;Brain Barrier</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress on 3D&#8208;bioprinted models of glioblastoma and the blood&#8211;brain barrier are reviewed. In order to inform future design and implementation of 3D modeling, cellular and extracellular matrix components of the native tissue microenvironments, relevant natural and synthetic biomaterials and various 3D bioprinting strategies, are discussed in detail.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most prevalent and lethal adult primary central nervous system cancer. An immunosuppresive and highly heterogeneous tumor microenvironment, restricted delivery of chemotherapy or immunotherapy through the blood&#8211;brain barrier (BBB), together with the brain's unique biochemical and anatomical features result in its universal recurrence and poor prognosis. As conventional models fail to predict therapeutic efficacy in GBM, in vitro 3D models of GBM and BBB leveraging patient&#8208; or healthy&#8208;individual&#8208;derived cells and biomaterials through 3D bioprinting technologies potentially mimic essential physiological and pathological features of GBM and BBB. 3D&#8208;bioprinted constructs enable investigation of cellular and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions in a species&#8208;matched, high&#8208;throughput, and reproducible manner, serving as screening or drug delivery platforms. Here, an overview of current 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models is provided, elaborating on the microenvironmental compositions of GBM and BBB, relevant biomaterials to mimic the native tissues, and bioprinting strategies to implement the model fabrication. Collectively, 3D&#8208;bioprinted GBM and BBB models are promising systems and biomimetic alternatives to traditional models for more reliable mechanistic studies and preclinical drug screenings that may eventually accelerate the drug development process for GBM.

         <title>2D Polarized Materials: Ferromagnetic, Ferrovalley, Ferroelectric Materials, and Related Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
The distinct physical origin of 2D polarizations and modulation on degrees of freedom are comprehensively summarized based on the hysteresis behaviors and interface effects. The novel multifunctional polarized devices are discussed, from which perspectives and guidelines are proposed for developing &#8220;beyond Moore&#8221; integrated devices and circuits.








Abstract
The emergence of 2D polarized materials, including ferromagnetic, ferrovalley, and ferroelectric materials, has demonstrated unique quantum behaviors at atomic scales. These polarization behaviors are tightly bonded to the new degrees of freedom (DOFs) for next generation information storage and processing, which have been dramatically developed in the past few years. Here, the basic 2D polarized materials system and related devices&#8217; application in spintronics, valleytronics, and electronics are reviewed. Specifically, the underlying physical mechanism accompanied with symmetry broken theory and the modulation process through heterostructure engineering are highlighted. These summarized works focusing on the 2D polarization would continue to enrich the cognition of 2D quantum system and promising practical applications.

         <title>Failing Forward: Stability of Transparent Electrodes Based on Metal Nanowire Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 33, Issue 5, February 4, 2021. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technology is a promising low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide, offering mechanical flexibility and low materials cost. The fundamental failure mechanisms of MNWs, strategies to computationally model MNW networks, characterization strategies, and encapsulation strategies are discussed. Lastly, a perspective on evaluating MNW&#8208;based electrodes based on their technological relevance and cost is presented.








Abstract
Metal nanowire (MNW)&#8208;based transparent electrode technologies have significantly matured over the last decade to become a prominent low&#8208;cost alternative to indium tin oxide (ITO). Beyond reaching the same level of performance as ITO, MNW networks offer additional advantages including flexibility and low materials cost. To facilitate adoption of MNW networks as a replacement to ITO, they must overcome their inherent stability issues while maintaining their properties and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the fundamental failure mechanisms of MNW networks are discussed in detail. Recent strategies to computationally model MNWs from the nano&#8208; to macroscale and suggest future work to capture dynamic failure to unravel mechanisms that account for convolution of the failure modes are highlighted. Strategies to characterize MNW network failure in situ and postmortem are also discussed. In addition, recent work about improving the stability of MNW networks via encapsulation is discussed. Lastly, a perspective is given on how to frame the requirements of MNW&#8208;encapsulant hybrids with reference to their target applications, namely: solar cells, transparent film heaters, sensors, and displays. A cost analysis to comment on the feasibility of implementing MNW hybrids is provided, and critical areas to focus on for future work on MNW networks are suggested.

         <title>Remote Control of Time&#8208;Regulated Stretching of Ligand&#8208;Presenting Nanocoils In Situ Regulates the Cyclic Adhesion and Differentiation of Stem Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Materials allowing unprecedented, remote, and cytocompatible control of in situ and time&#8208;regulated nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils that independently modulate ligand pitch in nanocoils are presented. It is demonstrated that magnetic control of ligand nanostretching promotes cyclic adhesion and mechanotransduction of stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo, which facilitates their consequential differentiation.








Abstract
Native extracellular matrix (ECM) can exhibit cyclic nanoscale stretching and shrinking of ligands to regulate complex cell&#8211;material interactions. Designing materials that allow cyclic control of changes in intrinsic ligand&#8208;presenting nanostructures in situ can emulate ECM dynamicity to regulate cellular adhesion. Unprecedented remote control of rapid, cyclic, and mechanical stretching (&#8220;ON&#8221;) and shrinking (&#8220;OFF&#8221;) of cell&#8208;adhesive RGD ligand&#8208;presenting magnetic nanocoils on a material surface in five repeated cycles are reported, thereby independently increasing and decreasing ligand pitch in nanocoils, respectively, without modulating ligand&#8208;presenting surface area per nanocoil. It is demonstrated that cyclic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (ligand nanostretching) facilitates time&#8208;regulated integrin ligation, focal adhesion, spreading, YAP/TAZ mechanosensing, and differentiation of viable stem cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) imaging reveals magnetic switching &#8220;ON&#8221; (stretching) and &#8220;OFF&#8221; (shrinking) of the nanocoils inside animals. Versatile tuning of physical dimensions and elements of nanocoils by regulating electrodeposition conditions is also demonstrated. The study sheds novel insight into designing materials with connected ligand nanostructures that exhibit nanocoil&#8208;specific nano&#8208;spaced declustering, which is ineffective in nanowires, to facilitate cell adhesion. This unprecedented, independent, remote, and cytocompatible control of ligand nanopitch is promising for regulating the mechanosensing&#8208;mediated differentiation of stem cells in vivo.

         <title>Giant and Reversible Barocaloric Effect in Trinuclear Spin&#8208;Crossover Complex Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant and robust barocaloric effect is demonstrated in a trinuclear Fe(II) complex that exhibits an abrupt spin&#8208;state transition with a negligible hysteresis. The pressure&#8208;dependent transition spans temperatures between 318 K at ambient pressure and 383 K at 2.6 kbar. The reversible entropy and temperature changes observed are among the highest reported for any caloric material thus far.








Abstract
A giant barocaloric effect (BCE) in a molecular material Fe3(bntrz)6(tcnset)6 (FBT) is reported, where bntrz = 4&#8208;(benzyl)&#8208;1,2,4&#8208;triazole and tcnset = 1,1,3,3&#8208;tetracyano&#8208;2&#8208;thioethylepropenide. The crystal structure of FBT contains a trinuclear transition metal complex that undergoes an abrupt spin&#8208;state switching between the state in which all three FeII centers are in the high&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 2) electronic configuration and the state in which all of them are in the low&#8208;spin (S&#160;= 0) configuration. Despite the strongly cooperative nature of the spin transition, it proceeds with a negligible hysteresis and a large volumetric change, suggesting that FBT should be a good candidate for producing a large BCE. Powder X&#8208;ray diffraction and calorimetry reveal that the material is highly susceptible to applied pressure, as the transition temperature spans the range from 318 at ambient pressure to 383 K at 2.6 kbar. Despite the large shift in the spin&#8208;transition temperature, its nonhysteretic character is maintained under applied pressure. Such behavior leads to a remarkably large and reversible BCE, characterized by an isothermal entropy change of 120 J kg&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 and an adiabatic temperature change of 35 K, which are among the highest reversible values reported for any caloric material thus far.

         <title>Recent Progress of Flexible Image Sensors for Biomedical Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The latest research of flexible image sensors for biomedical application&#160;is comprehensively reviewed. The individual components of an image sensor are described, along with basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of the image sensors and biomedical application of flexible image sensors are described. Finally, the outlook for future research regarding flexible image sensors is discussed.








Abstract
Flexible image sensors have attracted increasing attention as new imaging devices owing to their lightness, softness, and bendability. Since light can measure inside information from outside of the body, optical&#8208;imaging&#8208;based approaches, such as X&#8208;rays, are widely used for disease diagnosis in hospitals. Unlike conventional sensors, flexible image sensors are soft and can be directly attached to a curved surface, such as the skin, for continuous measurement of biometric information with high accuracy. Therefore, they are expected to gain wide application to wearable devices, as well as home medical care. Herein, the application of such sensors to the biomedical field is introduced. First, their individual components, photosensors, and switching elements, are explained. Then, the basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of each of these elements and the image sensors are described. Finally, examples of measuring the dynamic and static biometric information using flexible image sensors, together with relevant real&#8208;world measurement cases, are presented. Furthermore, recent applications of the flexible image sensors in the biomedical field are introduced.

Therefore, they are expected to gain wide application to wearable devices, as well as home medical care. Herein, the application of such sensors to the biomedical field is introduced. First, their individual components, photosensors, and switching elements, are explained. Then, the basic parameters used to evaluate the performance of each of these elements and the image sensors are described. Finally, examples of measuring the dynamic and static biometric information using flexible image sensors, together with relevant real&#8208;world measurement cases, are presented. Furthermore, recent applications of the flexible image sensors in the biomedical field are introduced.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Guided Mid&#8208;IR and Near&#8208;IR Light within a Hybrid Hyperbolic&#8208;Material/Silicon Waveguide Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hybrid platform composed of a hexagonal boron nitride slab and silicon waveguide enables guiding at both mid&#8208;infrared and near&#8208;infrared simultaneously. Theoretical calculations and infrared nanoimaging are applied to study the guided mid&#8208;infrared hyperbolic polaritons. The performance in the near&#8208;infrared is verified via transmission measurements and simulations. This demonstrates an approach to integrate hyperbolic media with silicon photonics.








Abstract
Silicon waveguides have enabled large&#8208;scale manipulation and processing of near&#8208;infrared optical signals on chip. Yet, expanding the bandwidth of guided waves to other frequencies will further increase the functionality of silicon as a photonics platform. Frequency multiplexing by integrating additional architectures is one approach to the problem, but this is challenging to design and integrate within the existing form factor due to scaling with the free&#8208;space wavelength. This paper demonstrates that a hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)/silicon hybrid waveguide can simultaneously enable dual&#8208;band operation at both mid&#8208;infrared (6.5&#8211;7.0&#160;&#181;m) and telecom (1.55&#160;&#181;m) frequencies, respectively. The device is realized via the lithography&#8208;free transfer of hBN onto a silicon waveguide, maintaining near&#8208;infrared operation. In addition, mid&#8208;infrared waveguiding of the hyperbolic phonon polaritons (HPhPs) supported in hBN is induced by the index contrast between the silicon waveguide and the surrounding air underneath the hBN, thereby eliminating the need for deleterious etching of the hyperbolic medium. The behavior of HPhP waveguiding in both straight and curved trajectories is validated within an analytical waveguide theoretical framework. This exemplifies a generalizable approach based on integrating hyperbolic media with silicon photonics for realizing frequency multiplexing in on&#8208;chip photonic systems.

         <title>Translocation of DNA through Ultrathin Nanoslits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules is studied through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, and the DNA polymer behavior is examined in this tight confinement. DNA molecules, including folds and knots, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions with the confining graphene surfaces.








Abstract
2D nanoslit devices, where two crystals with atomically flat surfaces are separated by only a few nanometers, have attracted considerable attention because their tunable control over the confinement allows for the discovery of unusual transport behavior of gas, water, and ions. Here, the passage of double&#8208;stranded DNA molecules is studied through nanoslits fabricated from exfoliated 2D materials, such as graphene or hexagonal boron nitride, and the DNA polymer behavior is examined in this tight confinement. Two types of events are observed in the ionic current: long current blockades that signal DNA translocation and short spikes where DNA enters the slits but withdraws. DNA translocation events exhibit three distinct phases in their current&#8208;blockade traces&#8212;loading, translation, and exit. Coarse&#8208;grained molecular dynamics simulation allows the different polymer configurations of these phases to be identified. DNA molecules, including folds and knots in their polymer structure, are observed to slide through the slits with near&#8208;uniform velocity without noticeable frictional interactions of DNA with the confining graphene surfaces. It is anticipated that this new class of 2D&#8208;nanoslit devices will provide unique ways to study polymer physics and enable lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip biotechnology.

         <title>A Multifunctional Origami Patch for Minimally Invasive Tissue Sealing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional patch presents new opportunities for sealing tissues in minimally invasive surgeries. Integration of a dynamic hydrophobic fluid layer, a microtextured bioadhesive layer, and a zwitterionic&#8208;interpenetrated elastomer layer enables the patch to withstand fluid&#8208;rich environments, maintain a robust seal, and minimize biofouling and inflammation. By employing various origami&#8208;based designs, the patch can be adapted for different clinical applications.








Abstract
For decades, bioadhesive materials have garnered great attention due to their potential to replace sutures and staples for sealing tissues during minimally invasive surgical procedures. However, the complexities of delivering bioadhesives through narrow spaces and achieving strong adhesion in fluid&#8208;rich physiological environments continue to present substantial limitations to the surgical translation of existing sealants. In this work, a new strategy for minimally invasive tissue sealing based on a multilayer bioadhesive patch, which is designed to repel body fluids, to form fast, pressure&#8208;triggered adhesion with wet tissues, and to resist biofouling and inflammation is introduced. The multifunctional patch is realized by a synergistic combination of three distinct functional layers: i) a microtextured bioadhesive layer, ii) a dynamic, blood&#8208;repellent hydrophobic fluid layer, and iii) an antifouling zwitterionic nonadhesive layer. The patch is capable of forming robust adhesion to tissue surfaces in the presence of blood, and exhibits superior resistance to bacterial adhesion, fibrinogen adsorption, and in vivo fibrous capsule formation. By adopting origami&#8208;based fabrication strategies, it is demonstrated that the patch can be readily integrated with a variety of minimally invasive end effectors to provide facile tissue sealing in ex vivo porcine models, offering new opportunities for minimally invasive tissue sealing in diverse clinical scenarios.

         <title>Multitasking MXene Inks Enable High&#8208;Performance Printable Microelectrochemical Energy Storage Devices for All&#8208;Flexible Self&#8208;Powered Integrated Systems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An all&#8208;flexible MXene&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic system is demonstrated on a single substrate through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, MXene&#8208;based lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries or micro&#8208;supercapacitors, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor, where the multitasking MXene is fully exploited as a high&#8208;capacitance electrode, a sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, a highly conducting current collector, a metal&#8208;free interconnector, and a conductive binder.








Abstract
The future of mankind holds great promise for things like the Internet of Things, personal health monitoring systems, and smart cities. To achieve this ambitious goal, it is imperative for electronics to be wearable, environmentally sustainable, and safe. However, large&#8208;scale manufacture of self&#8208;sufficient electronic systems by exploiting multifunctional materials still faces significant hurdles. Herein, multitasking aqueous printable MXene inks are reported as an additive&#8208;free high&#8208;capacitance electrode, sensitive pressure&#8208;sensing material, highly conducting current collector, metal&#8208;free interconnector, and conductive binder. By directly screen printing MXene inks, MXene&#8208;based micro&#8208;supercapacitors (MSCs) and lithium&#8208;ion microbatteries (LIMBs) are delicately fabricated on various substrates. The as&#8208;prepared MSCs exhibit ultrahigh areal capacitance of 1.1 F cm&#8722;2 and the serially connected MSCs offer a record voltage of 60&#160;V. The quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state LIMBs deliver a robust areal energy density of 154&#160;&#956;Wh&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, an all&#8208;flexible self&#8208;powered integrated system on a single substrate based on the multitasking MXene inks is demonstrated through seamless integration of a tandem solar cell, the LIMB, and an MXene hydrogel pressure sensor. Notably, this integrated system is exceptionally sensitive to body movements with a fast response time of 35&#160;ms. Therefore, this multipurpose MXene ink opens a new avenue for powering future smart appliances.

         <title>3D&#8208;Printed Biomimetic Systems with Synergetic Color and Shape Responses Based on Oblate Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Droplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems with synergetic color and shape responses based on oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are developed. The structural colored biomimetic systems possess a lot of unique properties, such as tunable color, reversible shape change, easy processing, and flexible patterning, making them applicable in various scenarios.








Abstract
Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.

&lt;p&gt;3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems with synergetic color and shape responses based on oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are developed. The structural colored biomimetic systems possess a lot of unique properties, such as tunable color, reversible shape change, easy processing, and flexible patterning, making them applicable in various scenarios.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living organisms in nature have amazing control over their color, shape, and morphology in response to environmental stimuli for camouflage, communication, or reproduction. Inspired by the camouflage of the octopus via the elongation or contraction of its pigment cells, oblate cholesteric liquid crystal droplets are dispersed in a polymer matrix, serving as the role of pigment cells and showing structural color due to selective Bragg reflection by their periodic helical structure. The color of 3D&#8208;printed biomimetic systems can be tuned by changing the helical pitch via the chiral dopant concentration or temperature. When the oblate liquid crystal droplets are heated up to isotropic, the opaque and colored biomimetic systems become transparent and colorless. Meanwhile, the isotropic liquid crystal droplets tend to become spherical, causing volume contraction along the film plane and volume dilation in the perpendicular direction. The internal strain combined with the gradient distribution of the oblate isotropic liquid crystal droplets result in corresponding shape transformations. The camouflage of a biomimetic octopus and the blossom of a biomimetic flower, both of which show synergetic color and shape responses, are demonstrated to inspire the design of functional materials and intelligent devices.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>2D Copper Tetrahydroxyquinone Conductive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework for Selective CO2 Electrocatalysis at Low Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The catalytic performance of 2D copper tetrahydroxyquinone conductive metal&#8211;organic framework (c&#8208;MOF) is studied in the CO2 reduction reaction. In the low overpotential range, the c&#8208;MOF catalyst delivers record values of turn over number for CO formation and a negligible overpotential for CO2 reduction reaction. These findings open a new path for further advances in core electrochemical reactions.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for electrocatalysis; however, lack of electrical conductivity in the majority of existing MOFs limits their effective utilization in the field. Herein, an excellent catalytic activity of a 2D copper (Cu)&#8208;based conductive MOF, copper tetrahydroxyquinone (Cu&#63743;THQ), is reported for aqueous CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) at low overpotentials. It is revealed that Cu&#63743;THQ nanoflakes (NFs) with an average lateral size of 140&#160;nm exhibit a negligible overpotential of 16&#160;mV for the activation of this reaction, a high current density of &#8776;173&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.45&#160;V versus RHE, an average Faradaic efficiency (F.E.) of &#8776;91% toward CO production, and a remarkable turnover frequency as high as &#8776;20.82 s&#8722;1. In the low overpotential range, the obtained CO formation current density is more than 35 and 25 times higher compared to state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art MOF and MOF&#8208;derived catalysts, respectively. The operando Cu K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption near edge spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations reveal the existence of reduced Cu (Cu+) during CO2RR which reversibly returns to Cu2+ after the reaction. The outstanding CO2 catalytic functionality of conductive MOFs (c&#8208;MOFs) can open a way toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical systems.

         <title>General Programmable Growth of Hybrid Core&#8211;Shell Nanostructures with Liquid Metal Nanodroplets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general programmable strategy to fabricate core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal nanodroplets as reformable core templates is demonstrated, offering a route to producing nanostructures with multiple, complex, and desired structures, compositions, and sizes on a large scale.








Abstract
Core&#8211;shell and hollow nanostructures have been receiving significant interest due to their potential in wide scientific and technological fields. Given such large scope, however, they still lag far behind in terms of the ambition toward controllably, or even programmatically, synthesizing libraries of core&#8211;shell structures on a large scale. Here, a general route for the programmable preparation of complex core&#8211;shell nanostructures by using liquid metal (LM) droplets as reformable templates is presented, and the triggering of a localized galvanic replacement reaction in one ultrasonication system is demonstrated. Benefiting from the activity and mobility of the metal components in LM templates, high&#8208;level compositional diversity control and quantitative regulation of both the core and the shell layers of the heterogeneous products are achieved, which cannot be realized with a solid&#8208;template synthetic route.

         <title>Revealing Structural Disorder in Hydrogenated Amorphous Silicon for a Low&#8208;Loss Photonic Platform at Visible Frequencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The atomic bonding networks of hydrogenated amorphous silicon are revealed to reduce its optical loss in the visible region. Atomic bonding networks are manipulated by controlling the process conditions of plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. The optimal atomic configuration demonstrates the low&#8208;loss hydrogenated amorphous silicon as an efficient photonic platform by expanding the working frequencies from the infrared to the visible spectrum.








Abstract
The high refractive index of hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a&#8208;Si:H) at optical frequencies is an essential property for the efficient modulation of the phase and amplitude of light. However, substantial optical loss represented by its high extinction coefficient prevents it from being utilized widely. Here, the bonding configurations of a&#8208;Si:H are investigated, in order to manipulate the extinction coefficient and produce a material that is competitive with conventional transparent materials, such as titanium dioxide and gallium nitride. This is achieved by controlling the hydrogenation and silicon disorder by adjusting the chemical deposition conditions. The extinction coefficient of the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H reaches a minimum of 0.082 at the wavelength of 450&#160;nm, which is lower than that of crystalline silicon (0.13). Beam&#8208;steering metasurfaces are demonstrated to validate the low&#8208;loss optical properties, reaching measured efficiencies of 42%, 62%, and 75% at the wavelengths of 450, 532, and 635&#160;nm, respectively. Considering its compatibility with mature complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor processes, the low&#8208;loss a&#8208;Si:H will provide a platform for efficient photonic operating in the full visible regime.

         <title>Tip&#8208;Enhanced Electric Field: A New Mechanism Promoting Mass Transfer in Oxygen Evolution Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new mechanistic understanding of the enhanced alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER) kinetics is achieved by employing dense arrays of nanocones with sharp tips. Local electric field promotes hydroxide ions aggregation near the high&#8208;curvature active sites, leading to lower overpotential and higher intrinsic OER activity compared to blunt cones.








Abstract
The slow kinetics of oxygen evolution reaction (OER) causes high power consumption for electrochemical water splitting. Various strategies have been attempted to accelerate the OER rate, but there are few studies on regulating the transport of reactants especially under large current densities when the mass transfer factor dominates the evolution reactions. Herein, NixFe1&#8211;x alloy nanocones arrays (with &#8776;2 nm surface NiO/NiFe(OH)2 layer) are adopted to boost the transport of reactants. Finite element analysis suggests that the high&#8208;curvature tips can enhance the local electric field, which induces an order of magnitude higher concentration of hydroxide ions (OH&#8722;) at the active sites and promotes intrinsic OER activity by 67% at 1.5 V. Experimental results show that a fabricated NiFe nanocone array electrode, with optimized alloy composition, has a small overpotential of 190 mV at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and 255 mV at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. When calibrated by electrochemical surface area, the nanocones electrode outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OER electrocatalysts. The positive effect of the tip&#8208;enhanced local electric field in promoting mass transfer is also confirmed by comparing samples with different tip curvature radii. It is suggested that this local field enhanced OER kinetics is a generic effect to other OER catalysts.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film quality is a governing factor determining the performance of RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The RP film quality for fabricating high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is discussed. Evaluation index and influential factors of RP perovskite films are first reviewed.

In the last decade, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have undergone unprecedented rapid development and become a promising candidate for a new&#8208;generation solar cell. Among various PSCs, typical 3D halide perovskite&#8208;based PSCs deliver the highest efficiency but they suffer from severe instability, which restricts their practical applications. By contrast, the low&#8208;dimensional Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite&#8208;based PSCs have recently raised increasing attention due to their superior stability. Yet, the efficiency of RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is still far from that of the 3D counterparts owing to the difficulty in fabricating high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. In pursuit of high&#8208;efficiency RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, it is critical to manipulate the film formation process to prepare high&#8208;quality RP perovskite films. This review aims to provide comprehensive understanding of the high&#8208;quality RP&#8208;type perovskite film formation by investigating the influential factors. On this basis, several strategies to improve the RP perovskite film quality are proposed via summarizing the recent progress and efforts on the preparation of high&#8208;quality RP perovskite film. This review will provide useful guidelines for a better understanding of the crystallization and phase kinetics during RP perovskite film formation process and the design and development of high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs, promoting the commercialization of PSC technology.

&lt;p&gt;The Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) perovskite film quality is a governing factor determining the performance of RP perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The RP film quality for fabricating high&#8208;performance RP perovskite&#8208;based PSCs is discussed. Evaluation index and influential factors of RP perovskite films are first reviewed. Based on this, strategies to improve RP perovskite film quality are also proposed.

         <title>Constructing Li&#8208;Rich Artificial SEI Layer in Alloy&#8208;Polymer Composite Electrolyte to Achieve High Ionic Conductivity for All Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Li&#8208;rich artificial SEI layer of about 60&#160;nm thick is successfully designed and constructed in the Li alloy filled poly(ethylene oxide) polymer electrolyte to achieve high ionic conductivity for lithium metal batteries. The LiFePO4&#160;| Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries exhibit high cycling performance of 111.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8211;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C in 45&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
To achieve high ionic conductivity for solid electrolyte, an artificial Li&#8208;rich interface layer of about 60&#160;nm thick has been constructed in polymer&#8208;based poly(ethylene oxide)&#8208;lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide composite solid electrolyte (briefly noted as PEOm) by adding Li&#8208;based alloys. As revealed by high&#8208;resolution transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, an artificial interface layer of amorphous feature is created around the Li&#8208;based alloy particles with the gradient distribution of Li across it. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical modeling demonstrate that the interface layer provides fast ion transport path and plays a key role in achieving high and stable ionic conductivity for PEOm&#8208;Li21Si5 composite solid electrolyte. The PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 composite electrolyte exhibits an ionic conductivity of 3.9 &#215; 10&#8211;5&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 30&#160;&#176;C and 5.6 &#215; 10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 at 45&#160;&#176;C. The LiFePO4 | PEOm&#8208;5%Li21Si5 | Li all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries could maintain a stable capacity of 129.2&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.2 C and 30&#160;&#176;C after 100 cycles, and 111.3&#160;mA&#160;h&#160;g&#8722;1 after 200 cycles at 0.5 C and 45&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating excellent cycling stability and high&#8208;rate capability.

         <title>RhSe2: A Superior 3D Electrocatalyst with Multiple Active Facets for Hydrogen Evolution Reaction in Both Acid and Alkaline Solutions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D structured transition metal sulfide, RhSe2, is synthesized, which exhibits high electrocatalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction in both acid and alkaline electrolyte.








Abstract
Layered 2D materials are a vital class of electrocatalys for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), due to their large area, excellent activity, and facile fabrication. Theoretical caculations domenstrate, however, that only the edges of the 2D nanosheets act as active sites, while the much larger basal plane exhibits passive activity. Here, from a distinguishing perspective, RhSe2 is reported as a &#8220;3D&#8221; electrocatalyst for HER with top&#8208;class activity, synthesized by a facile solid&#8208;state method. Superior to 2D materials, multiple crystal facets of RhSe2 exhibit near&#8208;zero free energy change of hydrogen adsorption (&#916;GH), which guarantees high performance in most common morphologies. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the low&#8208;coordinated Rh atoms act as the active sites in acid, which enables the modified Kubas&#8208;mediated pathway, while the Se atoms act as the active sites in an alkaline medium. The overpotentials of HER activity of RhSe2 are measured to be 49.9 and 81.6&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in acid and alkaline solutions, respectively. This work paves the way to new transition metal chalcogenide catalysts.

         <title>Realizing an All&#8208;Round Hydrogel Electrolyte toward Environmentally Adaptive Dendrite&#8208;Free Aqueous Zn&#8211;MnO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydrogel electrolyte with high ionic conductivity, ultralow freezing point, excellent mechanical properties, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability is constructed. It can effectively suppress the growth of zinc dendrites and the occurrence of parasitic side reactions, thereby enabling a high&#8208;performance flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery that can work normally in a wide temperature range.








Abstract
Flexible energy storage devices are at the forefront of next&#8208;generation power supplies, one of the most important components of which is the gel electrolyte. However, shortcomings exist, more or less, for all the currently developed hydrogel electrolytes. Herein, a facile and cost&#8208;effective method is developed to construct an all&#8208;round hydrogel electrolyte by using cotton as the raw material, tetraethyl orthosilicate as the crosslinker, and glycerol as the antifreezing agent. The obtained hydrogel electrolyte has high ionic conductivity, excellent mechanical properties (e.g., high tensile strength and elasticity), ultralow freezing point, good self&#8208;healing ability, high adhesion, and good heat&#8208;resistance ability. Remarkably, this hydrogel electrolyte can provide a record&#8208;breaking high ionic conductivity of 19.4 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C compared with previously reported aqueous electrolytes for zinc&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, this hydrogel electrolyte can significantly inhibit zinc dendritic growth and parasitic side reactions from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. With this hydrogel electrolyte, a flexible quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state Zn&#8211;MnO2 battery is assembled, which shows remarkable energy densities from &#8722;40 to 60&#160;&#176;C. The battery also exhibits outstanding cycling durability and has high endurance under various harsh conditions. This work opens new opportunities for the development of hydrogel electrolytes.

         <title>Colossal Magnetoresistance without Mixed Valence in a Layered Phosphide Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A change of paradigm in a technologically important phenomenon, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), is introduced. Previously, it was believed that CMR required ferromagnetic ordering and a structural distortion. EuCd2P2 has antiferromagnetic ordering and does not have a structural distortion or mixed valence, yet it exhibits the largest CMR known in a single crystal.








Abstract
Materials with strong magnetoresistive responses are the backbone of spintronic technology, magnetic sensors, and hard drives. Among them, manganese oxides with a mixed valence and a cubic perovskite structure stand out due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). A double exchange interaction underlies the CMR in manganates, whereby charge transport is enhanced when the spins on neighboring Mn3+ and Mn4+ ions are parallel. Prior efforts to find different materials or mechanisms for CMR resulted in a much smaller effect. Here an enormous CMR at low temperatures in EuCd2P2 without manganese, oxygen, mixed valence, or cubic perovskite structure is shown. EuCd2P2 has a layered trigonal lattice and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 11 K. The magnitude of CMR (104%) in as&#8208;grown crystals of EuCd2P2 rivals the magnitude in optimized thin films of manganates. The magnetization, transport, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray data suggest that strong magnetic fluctuations are responsible for this phenomenon. The realization of CMR at low temperatures without heterovalency leads to a new regime for materials and technologies related to antiferromagnetic spintronics.

&lt;p&gt;A change of paradigm in a technologically important phenomenon, the colossal magnetoresistance (CMR), is introduced. Previously, it was believed that CMR required ferromagnetic ordering and a structural distortion. EuCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has antiferromagnetic ordering and does not have a structural distortion or mixed valence, yet it exhibits the largest CMR known in a single crystal.


&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials with strong magnetoresistive responses are the backbone of spintronic technology, magnetic sensors, and hard drives. Among them, manganese oxides with a mixed valence and a cubic perovskite structure stand out due to their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR). A double exchange interaction underlies the CMR in manganates, whereby charge transport is enhanced when the spins on neighboring Mn&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; and Mn&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; ions are parallel. Prior efforts to find different materials or mechanisms for CMR resulted in a much smaller effect. Here an enormous CMR at low temperatures in EuCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; without manganese, oxygen, mixed valence, or cubic perovskite structure is shown. EuCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a layered trigonal lattice and exhibits antiferromagnetic ordering at 11 K. The magnitude of CMR (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;%) in as&#8208;grown crystals of EuCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rivals the magnitude in optimized thin films of manganates. The magnetization, transport, and synchrotron X&#8208;ray data suggest that strong magnetic fluctuations are responsible for this phenomenon. The realization of CMR at low temperatures without heterovalency leads to a new regime for materials and technologies related to antiferromagnetic spintronics.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Rational Design of High&#8208;Concentration Ti3+ in Porous Carbon&#8208;Doped TiO2 Nanosheets for Efficient Photocatalytic Ammonia Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheet with controllable Ti3+ concentration is prepared by a reproducible bottom&#8208;up strategy. The optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ exhibits a NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8211;1 h&#8211;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, the highest compared with all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts.








Abstract
Photocatalytic ammonia synthesis is exciting but quite challenging with a very moderate yield at present. One of the greatest challenges is to develop highly active centers in a photocatalyst for N2 reduction under ambient conditions. Herein, porous carbon&#8208;doped anatase TiOx (C&#8208;TiOx) nanosheets with high&#8208;concentration active sites of Ti3+ are presented, which are produced by layered Ti3SiC2 through a reproducible bottom&#8208;up approach. It is shown that the high&#8208;concentration Ti3+ sites are the major species for the significant increase in N2 photoreduction activity by the C&#8208;TiOx. Such bottom&#8208;up substitutional doping of C into TiO2 is responsible for both visible absorption and generation of Ti3+ concentration. Together with the porous nanosheets morphology and the loading of a Ru/RuO2 nanosized cocatalyst for enhanced charge separation and transfer, the optimal C&#8208;TiOx with a Ti3+/Ti4+ ratio of 72.1% shows a high NH3 production rate of 109.3 &#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under visible&#8208;light irradiation and a remarkable apparent quantum efficiency of 1.1% at 400&#160;nm, which is the highest compared to all TiO2&#8208;based photocatalysts at present.

         <title>Directional Polarized Light Emission from Thin&#8208;Film Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly directional and polarized light emission is demonstrated in thin&#8208;film light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) by suppressing the background emission and extracting only the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode. It is found that the TE waveguide mode increases with the refractive index of the emitting layer and a 2.6 times higher current efficiency is achieved in a perovskite LED.








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) with directional and polarized light emission have many photonic applications, and beam shaping of these devices is fundamentally challenging because they are Lambertian light sources. In this work, using organic and perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs) for demonstrations, by selectively diffracting the transverse electric (TE) waveguide mode while suppressing other optical modes in a nanostructured LED, the authors first demonstrate highly directional light emission from a full&#8208;area organic LED with a small divergence angle less than 3&#176; and a TE to transverse magnetic (TM) polarization extinction ratio of 13. The highly selective diffraction of only the TE waveguide mode is possible due to the planarization of the device stack by thermal evaporation and solution processing. Using this strategy, directional and polarized emission from a perovskite LED having a current efficiency 2.6 times compared to the reference planar device is further demonstrated. This large enhancement in efficiency in the PeLED is attributed to a larger contribution from the TE waveguide mode resulting from the high refractive index in perovskite materials.

         <title>Strong Chemical Interaction between Lithium Polysulfides and Flame&#8208;Retardant Polyphosphazene for Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries with Enhanced Safety and Electrochemical Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer for lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper can not only increase the electrochemical performance via strong chemical interaction between components, but also improves the safety of battery due to the high and low temperature resistance property as well as the good flame&#8208;retardant characteristics of PPZ.








Abstract
The shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPS) and potential safety hazard caused by the burning of flammable organic electrolytes, sulfur cathode, and lithium anode seriously limit the practical application of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Here, a flame&#8208;retardant polyphosphazene (PPZ) covalently modified holey graphene/carbonized cellulose paper is reported as a multifunctional interlayer in Li&#8211;S batteries. During the discharge/charge process, once the LiPS are generated, the as&#8208;obtained flame&#8208;retardant interlayer traps them immediately through the nucleophilic substitution reaction between PPZ and LiPS, effectively inhibiting the shuttling effect of LiPS to enhance the cycle stability of Li&#8211;S batteries. Meanwhile, this strong chemical interaction increases the diffusion coefficient for lithium ions, accelerating the lithiation reaction with complete inversion. Moreover, the as&#8208;obtained interlayer can be used as a fresh 3D current collector to establish a flame&#8208;retardant &#8220;vice&#8208;electrode,&#8221; which can trap dissolved sulfur and absorb a large amount of electrolyte, prominently bringing down the flammability of the sulfur cathode and electrolyte to improve the safety of Li&#8211;S batteries. This work provides a viable strategy for using PPZ&#8208;based materials as strong chemical scavengers for LiPS and a flame&#8208;retardant interlayer toward next&#8208;generation Li&#8211;S batteries with enhanced safety and electrochemical performance.

         <title>Unprecedented Fluorophore Photostability Enabled by Low&#8208;Loss Organic Hyperbolic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorophores are much more photostable on organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs) than on glass. On a glass substrate, fluorophores are photobleached almost immediately; highly photostable fluorophores, however, are observed on an OHM substrate. Fluorophore photobleaching lifetimes are lengthened up to four orders of magnitude with a 230&#8208;fold increase in photon counts.








Abstract
The dynamics of photons in fluorescent molecules plays a key role in fluorescence imaging, optical sensing, organic photovoltaics, and displays. Photobleaching is an irreversible photodegradation process of fluorophores, representing a fundamental limitation in relevant optical applications. Chemical reagents are used to suppress the photobleaching rate but with exceptionally high specificity for each type of fluorophore. Here, using organic hyperbolic materials (OHMs), an optical platform to achieve unprecedented fluorophore photostability without any chemical specificity is demonstrated. A more than 500&#8208;fold lengthening of the photobleaching lifetime and a 230&#8208;fold increase in the total emitted photon counts are observed simultaneously. These exceptional improvements solely come from the low&#8208;loss hyperbolic dispersion of OHM films and the large resultant Purcell effect in the visible spectral range. The demonstrated OHM platform may open up a new paradigm in nanophotonics and organic plasmonics for super&#8208;resolution imaging and the engineering of light&#8211;matter interactions at the nanoscale.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;Assembled Vacuolated Coacervates Control Macromolecule Spatiotemporal Distribution to Provide a Stable Segregated Cell Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups can self&#8208;assemble into stable vacuolated coacervates under physiological conditions, driven by the physical interactions (e.g., hydrogen bonding) derived from the end groups of the hydrophilic shell, thus providing novel insights into the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of coacervate organelles.








Abstract
Membraneless coacervate compartments in the intracellular and pericellular space mediate critical cellular functions. Developing synthetic coacervates that emulate the morphological, physical, and functional complexity of these natural coacervates is challenging but highly desirable. Herein, a generalizable nanoparticle assembly (NPA) strategy is developed, which is applicable to interactive core&#8211;shell nanoparticles with different chemical makeups, to fabricate vacuolated coacervates. The obtained NPA coacervates contain stable internal vacuoles to provide segregated microcompartments, which can mediate the spatially heterogeneous distribution of diverse macromolecules via restricted diffusion. It is further shown that the vacuolated NPA coacervates can harbor and retain macromolecular medium supplements to regulate the functions of cells encapsulated in vacuoles. Furthermore, the restricted macromolecule diffusion can be abolished on demand via the triggered coacervate&#8211;hydrogel transition, thereby altering the exposure of encapsulated cells to environmental factors. It is believed that the NPA strategy provides new insights into the design principles of hierarchical coacervates that hold promising potential for a wide array of biomedical applications.

         <title>Energy Harvesting and Storage with Soft and Stretchable Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review summarizes methods to harvest ambient energy (mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electromagnetic energy) using soft and stretchable materials. These materials and devices pave the way for untethered soft robots, self&#8208;powered sensors, wearable devices, stretchable electronics, and electronic skins. The review also discusses challenges and opportunities associated with ambient energy harvesting techniques.








Abstract
This review highlights various modes of converting ambient sources of energy into electricity using soft and stretchable materials. These mechanical properties are useful for emerging classes of stretchable electronics, e&#8208;skins, bio&#8208;integrated wearables, and soft robotics. The ability to harness energy from the environment allows these types of devices to be tetherless, thereby leading to a greater range of motion (in the case of robotics), better compliance (in the case of wearables and e&#8208;skins), and increased application space (in the case of electronics). A variety of energy sources are available including mechanical (vibrations, human motion, wind/fluid motion), electromagnetic (radio frequency (RF), solar), and thermodynamic (chemical or thermal energy). This review briefly summarizes harvesting mechanisms and focuses on the materials&#8217; strategies to render such devices into soft or stretchable embodiments.

         <title>Atomic&#8208;Level Charge Separation Strategies in Semiconductor&#8208;Based Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semiconductor photocatalytic efficiency greatly relies on effective charge separation. The recent progress of atomic&#8208;level strategies for promoting the charge separation and migration in the bulk, on the surface, and both bulk and surface of the photocatalysts are highlighted and a guideline for the bottom&#8208;up design of high&#8208;performance photocatalysts suggested.








Abstract
Semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysis as a productive technology furnishes a prospective solution to environmental and renewable energy issues, but its efficiency greatly relies&#160;on the effective bulk and surface separation of photoexcited charge carriers. Exploitation of atomic&#8208;level strategies allows in&#8208;depth understanding on the related mechanisms and enables bottom&#8208;up precise design of photocatalysts, significantly enhancing photocatalytic activity. Herein, the advances on atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies toward developing robust photocatalysts are highlighted, elucidating the fundamentals of charge separation and transfer processes and advanced probing techniques. The atomic&#8208;level bulk charge separation strategies, embodied by regulation of charge movement pathway and migration dynamic, boil&#160;down&#160;to shortening the charge diffusion distance to the atomic&#8208;scale, establishing atomic&#8208;level charge transfer channels, and enhancing the charge separation driving force. Meanwhile, regulating the in&#8208;plane surface structure and spatial surface structure are summarized as atomic&#8208;level surface charge separation strategies. Moreover, collaborative strategies for simultaneous manipulation of bulk and surface photocharges are also introduced. Finally, the existing challenges and future prospects for fabrication of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photocatalysts are discussed on the basis of a thorough comprehension of atomic&#8208;level charge separation strategies.

         <title>Approaching Crystal Structure and High Electron Mobility in Conjugated Polymer Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polymer microwire crystals are obtained from solvated aggregates. The precise crystal packing and electronic structure in polymer microwires are evaluated for understanding the charge transport properties. Polymer crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208;2T exhibit higher electron mobilities of up to 5.58&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 with a much lower hopping energy barrier compared with the conventional thin&#8208;film transistors.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers usually form crystallized and amorphous regions in the solid state simultaneously, making it difficult to accurately determine their precise microstructures. The lack of multiscale microstructures of conjugated polymers limits the fundamental understanding of the structure&#8211;property relationships in polymer&#8208;based optoelectronic devices. Here, crystals of two typical conjugated polymers based on four&#8208;fluorinated benzodifurandione&#8208;based oligo(p&#8208;phenylene vinylene) (F4BDOPV) and naphthalenediimide (NDI) motifs, respectively, are obtained by a controlled self&#8208;assembly process. The strong diffractivity of the polymer crystals brings an opportunity to determine the crystal structures by combining X&#8208;ray techniques and molecular simulations. The precise polymer packing structures are useful as initial models to evaluate the charge transport properties in the ordered and disordered phases. Compared to the spin&#8208;coated thin films, the highly oriented polymer chains in crystals endow higher mobilities with a lower hopping energy barrier. Microwire crystal transistors of F4BDOPV&#8208; and NDI&#8208;based polymers exhibit high electron mobilities of up to 5.58 and 2.56&#160;cm2&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1, respectively, which are among the highest values in polymer crystals. This work presents a simple method to obtain polymer crystals and their precise microstructures, promoting a deep understanding of molecular packing and charge transport for conjugated polymers.

         <title>A Virus&#8208;Mimicking Nucleic Acid Nanogel Reprograms Microglia and Macrophages for Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel is constructed using therapeutic miRNA as a crosslinker to direct the self&#8208;assembly of DNA&#8208;grafted polycaprolactone (DNA&#8208;g&#8208;PCL) brushes to form a nanogel. Vir&#8208;Gel can effectively reprogram microglia and macrophages from a tumor&#8208;promoting M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype, thereby breaking the immunosuppression tumor microenvironment of glioblastoma and improving the therapeutic effect.








Abstract
Immunotherapy is recognized as one of the most promising approaches to treat cancers. However, its effect in glioblastoma (GBM) treatment is insufficient, which can in part be attributed to the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). Microglia and macrophages are the main immune infiltrating cells in the TME of GBM. Unfortunately, instead of initiating the anti&#8208;tumor response, GBM&#8208;infiltrating microglia and macrophages switch to a tumor&#8208;promoting phenotype (M2), and support tumor growth, angiogenesis, and immunosuppression by the release of cytokines. In this work, a virus&#8208;mimicking membrane&#8208;coated nucleic acid nanogel Vir&#8208;Gel embedded with therapeutic miRNA is developed, which can reprogram microglia and macrophages from a pro&#8208;invasive M2 phenotype to an anti&#8208;tumor M1 phenotype. By mimicking the virus infection process, Vir&#8208;Gel significantly enhances the targetability and cell uptake efficiency of the miR155&#8208;bearing nucleic acid nanogel. In vivo evaluations demonstrate that Vir&#8208;Gel apparently prolongs the circulation lifetime of miR155 and endows it with an active tumor&#8208;targeting capability and excellent tumor inhibition efficacy. Owing to its noninvasive feature and effective delivery capability, the virus&#8208;mimicking nucleic acid nanogel provides a general and convenient platform that can successfully treat a wide range of diseases.

         <title>Metallic Diluted Dimerization in VO2 Tweeds</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The metal&#8211;insulator transition of VO2 holds promise for numerous applications, yet the phase trajectory remains poorly understood. This work shows that strained films develop multicomponent tweeds prior to relaxation to the monoclinic ground state, triggered by the nucleation of partially dimerized V&#8208;chains. The suppression of the bonding/antibonding splitting in&#160;&#8220;isolated&#8221; V sites renders metallicity to this new monoclinic phase.








Abstract
The observation of electronic phase separation textures in vanadium dioxide, a prototypical electron&#8208;correlated oxide, has recently added new perspectives on the long standing debate about its metal&#8211;insulator transition and its applications. Yet, the lack of atomically resolved information on phases accompanying such complex patterns still hinders a comprehensive understanding of the transition and its implementation in practical devices. In this work, atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy unveils the existence of ferroelastic tweed structures on &#8776;5 nm length scales, well below the resolution limit of currently used spectroscopic imaging techniques. Moreover, density functional theory calculations show that this pretransitional fine&#8208;scale tweed, which on average looks and behaves like the standard metallic rutile phase, is in fact weaved by semi&#8208;dimerized chains of vanadium in a new monoclinic phase that represents a structural bridge to the monoclinic insulating ground state. These observations provide a multiscale perspective for the interpretation of existing data, whereby phase coexistence and structural intermixing can occur all the way down to the atomic scale.

         <title>Terahertz Spin&#8208;to&#8208;Charge Conversion by Interfacial Skew Scattering in Metallic Bilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Terahertz emission spectroscopy is used to study spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion (S2C) in ferromagnetic (F)|nonmagnetic (N) bilayers metal thin films. The measurements indicate that S2C at F/N interfaces can become comparable to the overall S2C and that the sign is drastically affected by interface modifications. A possible extrinsic S2C mechanism, skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interfacial imperfections, is suggested.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of spin to charge transport and vice versa is of major relevance for the detection and generation of spin currents in spin&#8208;based electronics. Interfaces of heterostructures are known to have a marked impact on this process. Here, terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy is used to study ultrafast spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge&#8208;current conversion (S2C) in about 50 prototypical F|N bilayers consisting of a ferromagnetic layer F (e.g., Ni81Fe19, Co, or Fe) and a nonmagnetic layer N with strong (Pt) or weak (Cu and Al) spin&#8208;orbit coupling. Varying the structure of the F/N interface leads to a drastic change in the amplitude and even inversion of the polarity of the THz charge current. Remarkably, when N is a material with small spin Hall angle, a dominant interface contribution to the ultrafast charge current is found. Its magnitude amounts to as much as about 20% of that found in the F|Pt reference sample. Symmetry arguments and first&#8208;principles calculations strongly suggest that the interfacial S2C arises from skew scattering of spin&#8208;polarized electrons at interface imperfections. The results highlight the potential of skew scattering for interfacial S2C and propose a promising route to enhanced S2C by tailored interfaces at all frequencies from DC to terahertz.

         <title>Interplay of Different Major Ampullate Spidroins during Assembly and Implications for Fiber Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural spider major ampullate silk exhibits mechanical properties unmatched by most other known natural or man&#8208;made fibrous materials. Upon recombinant co&#8208;production of two different spidroins derived from one spider species, they interconnect already in solution and during assembly. Their interplay yields fibers with overall properties different to that of one&#8208;protein fibers, but equaling that of the natural blueprint.








Abstract
Major ampullate (MA) spider silk has fascinating mechanical properties combining strength and elasticity. All known natural MA silks contain at least two or more different spidroins; however, it is unknown why and if there is any interplay in the spinning dope. Here, two different spidroins from Araneus diadematus are co&#8208;produced in Escherichia coli to study the possible dimerization and effects thereof on the mechanical properties of fibers. During the production of the two spidroins, a mixture of homo&#8208; and heterodimers is formed triggered by the carboxyl&#8208;terminal domains. Interestingly, homodimeric species of the individual spidroins self&#8208;assemble differently in comparison to heterodimers, and stoichiometric mixtures of homo&#8208; and heterodimers yield spidroin networks upon assembly with huge impact on fiber mechanics upon spinning. The obtained results provide the basis for man&#8208;made tuning of spinning dopes to yield high&#8208;performance fibers.

         <title>State&#8208;Of&#8208;The&#8208;Art and Future Challenges in High Energy Lithium&#8211;Selenium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered intensive attention since Se cathode possesses high capacity and electronic conductivity. LSeBs experience a solid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transformation accompanied by side reactions in carbonate electrolytes while multiphase conversion in ether&#8208;based ones. The advances for cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes are summarized. The future research directions are also outlined to motivate more insightful works.








Abstract
Li&#8208;chalcogen batteries, especially the Li&#8211;S batteries (LSBs), have received paramount interests as next generation energy storage techniques because of their high theoretical energy densities. However, the associated challenges need to be overcome prior to their commercialization. Elemental selenium, another chalcogen member, would be an attractive alternative to sulfur owing to its higher electronic conductivity, comparable capacity density, and moreover, excellent compatibility with carbonate electrolytes. Unlike LSBs, the research and development of Li&#8211;Se batteries (LSeBs) have garnered burgeoning attention but are still in their infant stage, where a comprehensive yet in&#8208;depth overview is highly imperative to guide future research. Herein, a critical review of LSeBs, in terms of the underlying mechanisms, cathode design, blocking layer engineering, and emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes is provided. First, the electrolyte&#8208;dependent electrochemistry of LSeBs is discussed. Second, the advances in Se&#8208;based cathodes are comprehensively summarized, especially highlighting the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SexSy cathodes, and mainly focusing on their structures, compositions, and synthetic strategies. Third, the versatile separators/interlayers optimization and interface regulation are outlined, with a particular focus on the emerging solid&#8208;state electrolytes for advanced LSeBs. Last, the remaining challenges and research orientations in this booming field are proposed, which are expected to motivate more insightful works.
