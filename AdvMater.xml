         <title>Emerging Biomaterials Imaging Antitumor Immune Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Immunotherapy is one of the most promising clinical modalities for the treatment of malignant tumors and has shown excellent therapeutic outcomes in clinical settings. However, it continues to face several challenges, including long treatment cycles, high costs, immune&#8208;related adverse events, and low response rates. Thus, it is critical to predict the response rate to immunotherapy by using imaging technology in the preoperative and intraoperative. Here, we comprehensively summarize the latest advances in nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials used for predicting responses to immunotherapy via the imaging of immune cells and signaling molecules in the immune microenvironment. Several imaging methods, such as fluorescence imaging, magnetic resonance imaging, positron emission tomography imaging, ultrasound imaging, and photoacoustic imaging, used in immune predictive imaging, are discussed to show the potential of nanosystems for distinguishing immunotherapy responders from non&#8208;responders. Nanosystem&#8208;based biomaterials aided by various imaging technologies are expected to enable the effective prediction and diagnosis in cases of tumors, inflammation, and other public diseases.

         <title>Pass&#8208;transistor Logic Circuits Based on Wafer&#8208;Scale Two&#8208;Dimensional Semiconductors</title>

Abstract
Two&#8208;dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), have attracted tremendous attention in constructing advanced monolithic integrated circuits (ICs) for future flexible and energy&#8208;efficient electronics. However, the development of large&#8208;scale ICs based on 2D materials is still in its early stage, mainly due to the non&#8208;uniformity of the individual devices and little investigation of device and circuit level optimization. Herein, we successfully synthesized a 4&#8208;inch high&#8208;quality monolayer MoS2 film, which was then used to fabricate top gated (TG) MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs) with wafer&#8208;scale uniformity. Some basic circuits such as SRAM and ring oscillators were first examined. A pass&#8208;transistor logic configuration based on pseudo&#8208;NMOS was then employed to design more complex MoS2 logic circuits, which were successfully fabricated with proper logic functions tested. These preliminary integration efforts show the promising potential of wafer&#8208;scale 2D semiconductors for application in complex ICs.

         <title>Fluorinated Perylene&#8208;diimides: Cathode Interlayers Facilitating Carrier Collection for High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) have experienced rapid progress with the innovation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;absorbing small&#8208;molecular acceptors (SMAs), while the unique electronic properties of the SMAs raise new challenges in relation to cathode engineering for effective electron collection. To address this issue, we synthesized two fluorinated perylene&#8208;diimides (PDIs), PDINN&#8208;F and PDINN&#8208;2F by a simple fluorination method, for the application as cathode interlayer (CIL) materials. The two bay&#8208;fluorinated PDI based CILs possess lower the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy level of ca. &#8722;4.0&#160;eV, which improves the energy level alignment at the NIR&#8208;SMAs (such as BTP&#8208;eC9)/cathode interface for a favorable electron extraction efficiency. The mono&#8208;fluorinated PDINN&#8208;F shows higher electron mobility and better improved interfacial compatibility. The PDINN&#8208;F based OSCs with PM6: BTP&#8208;eC9 as active layer exhibit an enhanced fill factor and larger short&#8208;circuit current density, leading to a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) exceeding 18%. The devices with PDINN&#8208;F CIL retained more than 80% of its initial PCE after operating at the maximum power point under continuous illumination for 750 hours. This work prescribes a facile, cost&#8208;effective and scalable method for the preparation of stable, high&#8208;performance fluorinated CILs, and instilling promise for the NIR&#8208;SMAs&#8208;based OSCs moving forward.

         <title>Enhanced photoconductivity at dislocations in SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dislocations are one&#8208;dimensional crystallographic line defects and are usually seen as detrimental to the functional properties of classic semiconductors. It is shown here that this not necessarily accounts for oxide semiconductors in which dislocations are capable of boosting the photoconductivity. Strontium titanate single crystals are controllably deformed to generate a high density of ordered dislocations of two slip systems possessing different mesoscopic arrangements. For both slip systems, nanoscale conductive atomic force microscope investigations reveal a strong enhancement of the photoconductivity around the dislocation cores. Macroscopic in&#8208;plane measurements indicate that the two dislocation systems result in different global photoconductivity behavior despite the similar local enhancement. Depending on the arrangement, the global photoresponse can be increased by orders of magnitude. Additionally, indications for a bulk photovoltaic effect enabled by dislocation&#8208;surrounding strain fields are observed for the first time. This proves that dislocations in oxide semiconductors can be of large interest for tailoring photoelectric functionalities. Direct evidence that electronic transport is confined to the dislocation core points to a new emerging research field.

         <title>High&#8208;stretchability, Ultralow&#8208;hysteresis Conducting Polymer Hydrogel Strain Sensors for Soft Machines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Highly stretchable conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensors are rapidly emerging as a promising candidate towards diverse wearable skins and sensing devices for soft machines. However, due to the intrinsic limitations of low stretchability and large hysteresis, existing strain sensors cannot fully exploit their potential when used in a wearable or robotic system. Here, we present a PEDOT:PSS&#8208;PVA conducting polymer hydrogel strain sensor exhibiting both ultimate strain (300%) and negligible hysteresis (&lt;1.5%). This is achieved through a unique microphase semi&#8208;separated network design by compositing poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS) nanofibers with poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) and facile fabrication by combining 3D printing and successive freeze&#8208;thawing. We systematically characterize the overall superior performances of our strain sensor including stretchability, linearity, cyclic stability, and robustness against mechanical twisting and pressing. We further demonstrate the integration and application of such strain sensor with electronic skins to measure various physiological signals, identify hand gestures, enable a soft gripper for objection recognition, and remote control of an industrial robot. This work may offer both promising conducting polymer hydrogels with enhanced sensing functionalities and technical platforms towards stretchable electronic skins and intelligent robotic systems.

         <title>Development of Pure Green Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Material by Cyano Substitution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Multiple resonance (MR) effect&#8208;induced thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials have garnered significant attention because they can achieve both high color purity and high external quantum efficiency (EQE). However, the reported green&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF materials exhibit broader emission compared to those of blue&#8208;emitting ones and suffer from severe efficiency roll&#8208;off due to insufficient rate constants of reverse intersystem crossing process (kRISC). Herein, we report a pure green MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA&#8208;CN&#8208;Me) with high kRISC of 105 s&#8211;1. The key to success is introduction of cyano groups into a blue&#8208;emitting MR&#8208;TADF material (&#957;&#8208;DABNA), which causes remarkable bathochromic shift without a loss of color purity. The organic light&#8208;emitting diode employing it as an emitter exhibits green emission at 504&#160;nm with a small full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm, corresponding to the Commission Internationale d&#8217;&#201;clairage coordinates of (0.13, 0.65). The device achieves a high maximum EQE of 31.9% and successfully suppresses the efficiency roll&#8208;off at a high luminance.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicle&#8208;Based Drug Delivery Systems for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Therapies through Modulating Cancer&#8208;Immunity Cycle</title>

Abstract
Although immunotherapy that harnesses the activity of the immune system against tumors has made great progress, the treatment efficacy remains limited in most cancers. Current anticancer immunotherapy is primarily based on T cell&#8208;mediated cellular immunity, which highly relies on the efficiency of triggering cancer&#8208;immunity cycle, namely tumor antigen release, antigen presentation by antigen presenting cells, T cell activation, recruitment and infiltration of T cells into tumors, and recognition and killing of tumor cells by T cells. Unfortunately, these immunotherapies are restricted by inefficient drug delivery and acting on only a single step of the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. Due to the high biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, intrinsic cell targeting and easy chemical and genetic manipulation, extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems have been widely used to amplify the anticancer immune responses by serving as an integrated platform for multiple drugs or therapeutic strategies to synergistically activate several steps of cancer&#8208;immunity cycle. This review summarizes the various mechanisms related to affecting the cancer&#8208;immunity cycle disorders. Meanwhile, the preparation and application of extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems in modulating cancer&#8208;immunity cycle are introduced, especially in the improvement of T cell recruitment and infiltration into tumors. Finally, we briefly discuss the opportunities and challenges of extracellular vesicle&#8208;based drug delivery systems in translational clinical applications.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Dipole Interaction Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Single Ion Polymer Conductors for Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>

Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes with large ionic conductivity, high ionic transference number, and good interfacial compatibility with electrodes are highly desired for solid&#8208;state batteries. However, unwanted polarizations and side reactions occurring in traditional dual ion polymer conductors hinder their practical applications. Here, single ion polymer conductors (SIPCs) with exceptional selectivity for Li&#8208;ion conduction (Li&#8208;ion transference number up to 0.93), high room&#8208;temperature ionic conductivity of about 10&#8211;4 S cm&#8211;1, and a wide electrochemical stability window (&gt; 4.5&#160;V, versus Li/Li+) are prepared by precisely regulating the ion&#8208;dipole interactions between Li+ and carbonyl/cyano groups. The resulting SIPCs show an excellent electrochemical stability with Li metal during long&#8208;term cycling at room temperature and 60&#176;C. LiFePO4&#8208;based solid&#8208;state cells containing the SIPCs exhibit good rate and cycling performance in a wide temperature range from &#8211;20 to 90&#176;C. By the same way of ion&#8208;dipole interaction regulation, sodium and potassium&#8208;based SIPCs with both high ionic conductivity and high cationic transference numbers are also prepared. The findings in this work provide a guidance for the development of high&#8208;performance SIPCs and other metal ion systems beyond Li+.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Healing of Metal Oxides Assisted by Polymer&#8211;Inorganic Hybrid Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Healing of defects in metal oxide (MeO) coatings occurs through rearrangement of Cl&#8208;decorated MeO particles formed by vapor phase infiltration inside a polymer, segregation at the defect interface, and their subsequent hydrolysis in air.








Abstract
Enabling self&#8208;healing of materials is crucially important for saving resources and energy in numerous emerging applications. While strategies for the self&#8208;healing of polymers are advanced, mechanisms for semiconducting inorganic materials are scarce due to the lack of suitable healing agents. Here a concept for the self&#8208;healing of metal oxides is developed. This concept consists of metal oxide nanoparticle growth inside the bulk of halogenated polymers and their subsequent entropy&#8208;driven migration to externally induced defect sites, leading to recovery of the defect. Herein, it is demonstrated that the pool of self&#8208;healing materials is expanded to include semiconductors, thereby increasing the reliability and sustainability of functional materials through the use of metal oxides. It is revealed that electrical properties of tin&#8208;doped indium oxide can be partially restored upon healing. Such properties are of immediate interest for the further development of transparent flexible electrodes.

         <title>Conformation Dynamics of Single Polymer Strands in Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conformational changes in macromolecules significantly affect their functions and assembly into high&#8208;level structures. Despite advances in theoretical and experimental studies, investigations into the intrinsic conformational variations and dynamic motions of single macromolecules remain challenging. Here, liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables the real&#8208;time tracking of single&#8208;chain polymers. Imaging linear polymers, synthetically dendronized with conjugated aromatic groups, in organic solvent confined within graphene liquid cells, directly exhibits chain&#8208;resolved conformational dynamics of individual semi&#8208;flexible polymers. Our experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the dynamic conformational transitions of the single chain polymer originate from the degree of intra&#8208;chain interactions. In situ observations also show that such dynamics of the single chain polymer are significantly affected by environmental factors, including surfaces and interfaces.

Abstract
Water electrolysis involves two parallel reactions, i.e., oxygen evolution and hydrogen evolution (HER), in which sluggish oxygen evolution is a significant limiting step, that results in high energy consumption. Coupling the thermodynamically favorable electrooxidation of organic alternatives to value&#8208;added fine chemicials HER is a promising approach for the simultaneous cost&#8208;effective production of value&#8208;added chemicals and hydrogen. Here, we introduce a new coupling system for the green electrochemical synthesis of organic energetic materials plus hydrogen production using single&#8208;atom catalysts. The catalysts are prepared by the facile galvanostatic deposition of ruthenium single atoms on the molybdenum selenide, and reveal a low HER overpotential of 38.9&#160;mV at &#8211;10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 in an alkaline medium. Importantly, the cell voltage of water electrolysis can be significantly reduced to only 1.35&#160;V at a current of 10&#160;mA cm&#8211;2, by coupling water splitting with the electrooxidation of 5&#8208;amino&#8208;1H&#8208;tetrazole to synthesize 5,5&#8242;&#8208;azotetrazolate energetic material. These materials are traditionally synthesized under harsh conditions involving a strong oxidizing agent, high&#8208;temperature condition, and difficult separation of by&#8208;products. This study provides a green and efficient method of synthesizing organic energetic materials while simultaneously producing hydrogen.

         <title>Achieving 19% Power Conversion Efficiency in Planar&#8208;Mixed Heterojunction Organic Solar Cells Using a Pseudo&#8208;Symmetric Electron Acceptor</title>

Abstract
A record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of over 19% has been realized in planar&#8208;mixed heterojunction (PMHJ) organic solar cells (OSCs) by adopting the asymmetric selenium substitution strategy in making a pseudo&#8208;symmetric electron acceptor, BS3TSe&#8208;4F. The combined molecular asymmetry with more polarizable selenium substitution increases the dielectric constant of D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F blend, helping lower the exciton binding energy. On the other hand, they facilitate dimer packing in BS3TSe&#8208;4F to enable free charge generation, helping more efficient exciton dissociation and lowering the radiative recombination loss (&#916;E2) of OSCs. As a result, PMHJ OSCs based on D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F achieved a PCE of 18.48%. By incorporating another mid&#8208;bandgap acceptor Y6&#8208;O into D18/BS3TSe&#8208;4F to form a ternary PMHJ, a higher open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) could be achieved to realize an impressive PCE of 19.03%. Our findings of using pseudo&#8208;symmetric electron acceptors in enhancing device efficiency provides an effective way to develop highly efficient acceptor materials for OSCs.F

         <title>Thermal Shock Fabrication of Ion&#8208;stabilized Perovskite and Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
Abstract
Here we show a highly crystalline perovskite grain structure with compressed surface lattice realized by a thermal&#8208;shocking fabrication. The strained perovskite grain structure is stabilized by Cl&#8211;&#8208;reinforcing surface lattice and show enhanced bonding energy and ionic activation temperature, which contributes to hysteresis&#8208;free operation of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) at much higher temperature up to 363 K in thermal&#8208;shocking processed MAPbClxI3&#8208;x (T&#8208;MPI). The PSCs can be fabricated by a high&#8208;speed fully&#8208;air&#8208;process without post annealing based on scalable bar&#8208;coating technique. Both high efficiency and stability are achieved in T&#8208;MPI PSC with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) up to 22.99% and long&#8208;term operational stability with T80 lifetime exceeding 4000 hours.

         <title>Sb2Se3 Thin&#8208;Film Solar Cells Exceeding 10% Power Conversion Efficiency Enabled by Injection Vapor Deposition Technology</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An injection vapor deposition (IVD) technology is designed and demonstrated. The IVD produces compact antimony selenide (Sb2Se3) films with high orientation preference, fewer deep&#8208;level trap levels, and suppressed non&#8208;radiative recombination, achieving a record power conversion efficiency of 10.12% for Sb2Se3 photovoltaics.








Abstract
Binary Sb2Se3 semiconductors are promising as the absorber materials in inorganic chalcogenide compound photovoltaics due to their attractive anisotropic optoelectronic properties. However, Sb2Se3 solar cells suffer from complex and unconventional intrinsic defects due to the low symmetry of the quasi&#8208;1D crystal structure resulting in a considerable voltage deficit, which limits the ultimate power conversion efficiency (PCE). In this work, the creation of compact Sb2Se3 films with strong [00l] orientation, high crystallinity, minimal deep level defect density, fewer trap states, and low non&#8208;radiative recombination loss by injection vapor deposition is reported. This deposition technique enables superior films compared with close&#8208;spaced sublimation and coevaporation technologies. The resulting Sb2Se3 thin&#8208;film solar cells yield a PCE of 10.12%, owing to the suppressed carrier recombination and excellent carrier transport and extraction. This method thus opens a new and effective avenue for the fabrication of high&#8208;quality Sb2Se3 and other high&#8208;quality chalcogenide semiconductors.

         <title>An Intracellular Self&#8208;Assembly&#8208;Driven Uninterrupted ROS Generator Augments 5&#8208;Aminolevulinic&#8208;Acid&#8208;Based Tumor Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the natural biotransformation of 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA) (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an intracellular self&#8208;assembly&#8208;driven uninterrupted reactive oxygen species (ROS) generator (URG) is developed for amplified tumor therapy. The URG can not only generate 1O2 under laser irradiation, but also converts useless heme into peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly, which can effectively catalyze H2O2 to &#8226;OH, thus realizing &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted ROS generation.








Abstract
Free radical therapy based on 5&#8208;aminolevulinic acid (ALA, a precursor of the photosensitizer protoporphyrin IX (PpIX)) has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration for clinical tumor treatment. However, PpIX can be quickly converted into photoinactive heme, leading to unexpectedly paused production of free radicals and severely hindering its therapeutic benefits. Here, inspired by the natural biotransformation of ALA (ALA&#8208;PpIX&#8208;heme), an uninterrupted reactive oxygen species generator (URG) that converts useless heme to peroxidase mimics via intracellular self&#8208;assembly is developed. The URG is prepared by enwrapping ALA&#8208;loaded polyamide&#8208;amine dendrimers in red blood cell membrane vesicles with a further surface modification of G&#8208;quadruplex&#8208;structured AS1411. The URGs realize &#8220;1O2&#8722;&#8226;OH&#8221; uninterrupted generation through &#8220;recycling waste&#8221; in two steps: i) PpIX generates 1O2 under laser irradiation; and ii) the photoinactive metabolite heme self&#8208;assembled with AS1411 to catalyze H2O2 conversion into &#8226;OH. Interestingly, the specific generation of 1O2 in mitochondria and &#8226;OH in nuclei further augments the free&#8208;radical&#8208;induced damage. It is demonstrated that URG can continuously produce free radicals for 6 h postirradiation, and shows 3.3&#8208;times more than that of the nonassembly group, achieving nearly 80% regression of tumors in vivo.

         <title>Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of 31 types of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs) with either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (glucose, galactose, mannose, N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is constructed to identify cancer&#8208;targeting GlyNPs for targeted cancer therapy. GlyNPCD composed of mannose/N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine targets A549 and CT26 tumors, while GlyNPABC composed of glucose/galactose/mannose targets DU145 tumors.








Abstract
Cancer&#8208;targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited mostly to antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here, a library of glycocalyx&#8208;mimicking nanoparticles as a platform to enable screening and identification of cancer&#8208;targeting nanomedicines is reported. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;&#8208;glucose, &#946;&#8208;galactose, &#945;&#8208;mannose, &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl glucosamine, and &#946;&#8208;N&#8208;acetyl galactosamine) is converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs).

     alt="Systematic Screening and Therapeutic Evaluation of Glyconanoparticles with Differential Cancer Affinities for Targeted Cancer Therapy"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A library of 31 types of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs) with either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (glucose, galactose, mannose, N-acetyl glucosamine, and &lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl galactosamine) is constructed to identify cancer-targeting GlyNPs for targeted cancer therapy. GlyNP&lt;sup&gt;CD&lt;/sup&gt; composed of mannose/&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl glucosamine targets A549 and CT26 tumors, while GlyNP&lt;sup&gt;ABC&lt;/sup&gt; composed of glucose/galactose/mannose targets DU145 tumors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cancer-targeting ligands used for nanomedicines have been limited mostly to antibodies, peptides, aptamers, and small molecules thus far. Here, a library of glycocalyx-mimicking nanoparticles as a platform to enable screening and identification of cancer-targeting nanomedicines is reported. Specifically, a library of 31 artificial glycopolymers composed of either homogeneous or heterogeneous display of five different sugar moieties (&#946;-glucose, &#946;-galactose, &#945;-mannose, &#946;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl glucosamine, and &#946;-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetyl galactosamine) is converted to a library of glyconanoparticles (GlyNPs). GlyNPs optimal for targeting CT26, DU145, A549, and PC3 tumors are systematically screened and identified. The cypate-conjugated GlyNP displaying &#945;-mannose and &#946;-N-acetyl glucosamine show selective targeting and potent photothermal therapeutic efficacy against A549 human lung tumors. The docetaxel-contained GlyNP displaying &#946;-glucose, &#946;-galactose, and &#945;-mannose demonstrate targeted chemotherapy against DU145 human prostate tumors. The results presented herein collectively demonstrate that the GlyNP library is a versatile platform enabling the identification of cancer-targeting glyconanoparticles and suggest its potential applicability for targeting various diseased cells beyond cancer.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Not All Aggregates are Made the Same: Distinct Structures of Solution Aggregates Drastically Modulate Assembly Pathways, Morphology and Electronic Properties of Conjugated Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Tuning structures of solution&#8208;state aggregation and aggregation&#8208;mediated assembly pathways of conjugated polymers is crucial for optimizing their solid&#8208;state morphology and charge transport property. However, it remains challenging to unravel and control the exact structures of solution aggregates, let alone to modulate assembly pathways in a controlled fashion. Herein, we largely modulate aggregate structures of an isoindigo&#8208;bithiophene&#8208;based polymer (PII&#8208;2T) by tuning selectivity of the solvent towards the side chain versus the backbone, which leads to three distinct assembly pathways: direct crystallization from side&#8208;chain associated amorphous aggregates, chiral liquid crystal (LC)&#8208;mediated assembly from semicrystalline aggregates with side&#8208;chain and backbone stacking, random agglomeration from backbone&#8208;stacked semicrystalline aggregates. Importantly, we demonstrate for the first time that the amorphous solution aggregates, compared with semicrystalline ones, lead to significantly improved alignment and reduced paracrystalline disorder in solid&#8208;state due to direct crystallization during the meniscus&#8208;guided coating process. Alignment quantified by dichroic ratio obtained from grazing incidence X&#8208;ray diffraction (GIXD) is enhanced by up to fourteen&#8208;fold, and the charge carrier mobility increases by a maximum of twenty&#8208;fold in films printed from amorphous aggregates compared to those from semicrystalline aggregates. This work shows that by tuning the precise structure of solution aggregates, one can drastically tune assembly pathways, and the resulting thin film morphology and device properties.

         <title>Three&#8208;Tier Hierarchical Structures for Extreme Pool Boiling Heat Transfer Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Boiling is an effective energy transfer process with substantial utility in energy applications. Boiling performance is described mainly by the heat transfer coefficient (HTC) and critical heat flux (CHF). Recent efforts for the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF have been limited by an intrinsic trade&#8208;off between them &#8212; HTC enhancement requires high nucleation site density, which can increase bubble coalescence resulting in limited CHF enhancement. In this work, we overcome this trade&#8208;off by designing three&#8208;tier hierarchical structures. We minimize bubble coalescence to enhance CHF by defining nucleation sites with microcavities interspersed within hemi&#8208;wicking structures. Meanwhile, the reduced nucleation site density is compensated for by incorporating nanostructures that promote evaporation for HTC enhancement. Our hierarchical structures demonstrate the simultaneous enhancement of HTC and CHF up to 389% and 138%, respectively, compared to a smooth surface. This extreme boiling performance can lead to significant energy savings in a variety of boiling applications.

         <title>Complex oxides for brain&#8208;inspired computing: A review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fields of brain&#8208;inspired computing, robotics, and, more broadly, artificial intelligence seek to implement knowledge gleaned from the natural world into human&#8208;designed electronics and machines. Most advances to date have happened in software and algorithms. However, there is growing interest in designing hardware, i.e., new semiconductor materials and devices and their interconnections that can impart intelligence at the device or network level for software co&#8208;design. This requires a paradigm shift in the way one thinks of semiconductors where the intrinsic material or device itself can learn, be re&#8208;programmed, remember or forget information and, when connected, collectively create output signals that are non&#8208;trivial, emergent summation of individual components. In this review, we discuss the opportunities presented by complex oxides, a class of electronic ceramic materials whose properties can be elegantly tuned by doping, electron interactions and a variety of external stimuli near room temperature. Most importantly, oxides can host a vast number of electrically addressable metastable phases by carrier doping and subtle crystal structure distortions essential for adaptive devices. Concurrent changes in optical or magnetic properties create opportunities for multi&#8208;modal readout. Since neuroscience and evolutionary biology disciplines serve as an inspiration and scientific guiding disciplines for neuromorphic computing, we begin with a discussion of natural intelligence at the elementary level in the nervous system, followed by collective intelligence and learning at the animal colony level mediated by social interactions. An important aspect we highlight here is the vast spatial and temporal scales involved in learning and memory. We then focus on phenomena such as metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions, ferroelectricity, and related examples to highlight recent demonstrations of artificial neurons, synapses, and circuits and their learning behavior. First&#8208;principles theoretical treatments of the electronic structure; in&#8208;situ synchrotron spectroscopy of operating devices is then discussed. We review the implementation of the experimental characteristics into neural networks and algorithm design. Finally, we highlight outstanding materials challenges that require a microscopic understanding of the physical mechanisms which will be essential for advancing the frontiers of neuromorphic computing.

         <title>Cell&#8208;in&#8208;Catalytic&#8208;Shell Nanoarchitectonics: Catalytic Empowerment of Individual Living Cells by Single&#8208;Cell Nanoencapsulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;catalytic&#8208;shell biohybrid structures are constructed by in situ supramolecular self&#8208;assembly of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid, with concomitant enzyme embedment. The Fe3+&#8208;BTC nanoshells on individual living cells enhance the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining the reaction intermediates to the internal voids and impart extrinsic functions to the cells beyond the scope of biological evolution.








Abstract
Cell&#8208;in&#8208;shell biohybrid structures, synthesized by encapsulating individual living cells with exogenous materials, have emerged as exciting functional entities for engineered living materials, with emergent properties outside the scope of biochemical modifications. Artificial exoskeletons have, to date, provided physicochemical shelters to the cells inside in the first stage of technological development, and further advances in the field demand catalytically empowered, cellular hybrid systems that augment the biological functions of cells and even introduce completely new functions to the cells. This work describes a facile and generalizable strategy for empowering living cells with extrinsic catalytic capability through nanoencapsulation of living cells with a supramolecular metal&#8211;organic complex of Fe3+ and benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxylic acid (BTC). A series of enzymes are embedded in situ, without loss of catalytic activity, in the Fe3+&#8208;BTC shells, not to mention the superior characteristics of cytocompatible and rapid shell&#8208;forming processes. The nanoshell enhances the catalytic efficiency of multienzymatic cascade reactions by confining reaction intermediates to its internal voids and the nanoencapsulated cells acquire exogenous biochemical functions, including enzymatic cleavage of lethal octyl&#8208;&#946;&#8208;d&#8208;glucopyranoside into d&#8208;glucose, with autonomous cytoprotection. The system will provide a versatile, nanoarchitectonic tool for interfacing biological cells with functional materials, especially for catalytic bioempowerment of living cells.

A &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported to fabricate freestanding and flexible electrodes. The multimaterial, multilayer, and shape&#8208;designable properties of the SHAPE method for fabrication of flexible electrodes provide electronics with unconfined stacking, customizable stretchability, and conformable integration on arbitrary surfaces, demonstrating their wide spectrum of applications in wearable and 3D integrated electronics.








Abstract
Flexible electrodes that are multilayer, multimaterial, and conformal are pivotal for multifunctional wearable electronics. Traditional electronic circuits manufacturing requires substrate&#8208;supported transfer printing, which limits their multilayer integrity and device conformability on arbitrary surfaces. Herein, a &#8220;shrinkage&#8208;assisted patterning by evaporation&#8221; (SHAPE) method is reported, by employing evaporation&#8208;induced interfacial strain mismatch, to fabricate auto&#8208;detachable, freestanding, and patternable electrodes. The SHAPE method utilizes vacuum&#8208;filtration of polyaniline/bacterial cellulose (PANI/BC) ink through a masked filtration membrane to print high&#8208;resolution, patterned, and multilayer electrodes. The strong interlayer hydrogen bonding ensures robust multilayer integrity, while the controllable evaporative shrinking property of PANI/BC induces mismatch between the strains of the electrode and filtration membrane at the interface and thus autodetachment of electrodes. Notably, a 500&#8208;layer substrateless micro&#8208;supercapacitor fabricated using the SHAPE method exhibits an energy density of 350 mWh cm&#8722;2 at a power density of 40&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, 100 times higher than reported substrate&#8208;confined counterparts. Moreover, a digital circuit fabricated using the SHAPE method functions stably on a deformed glove, highlighting the broad wearable applications of the SHAPE method.

         <title>Delivering Mechanical Stimulation to Cells: State of the Art in Materials and Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biophysical signals, especially mechanical cues, are crucial in many (patho)physiological processes. An overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of materials and devices that can deliver mechanical stimulation to cells and tissues, with a focus on their design principles, is provided, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.








Abstract
Biochemical signals, such as growth factors, cytokines, and transcription factors are known to play a crucial role in regulating a variety of cellular activities as well as maintaining the normal function of different tissues and organs. If the biochemical signals are assumed to be one side of the coin, the other side comprises biophysical cues. There is growing evidence showing that biophysical signals, and in particular mechanical cues, also play an important role in different stages of human life ranging from morphogenesis during embryonic development to maturation and maintenance of tissue and organ function throughout life. In order to investigate how mechanical signals influence cell and tissue function, tremendous efforts have been devoted to fabricating various materials and devices for delivering mechanical stimuli to cells and tissues. Here, an overview of the current state of the art in the design and development of such materials and devices is provided, with a focus on their design principles, and challenges and perspectives for future research directions are highlighted.

         <title>Phonon Symphony of Stacked Multilayers and Weak Bonds Lowers Lattice Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity (0.79 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, which is almost four times lower than that of binary Cr3Se4), or twice lower than that of Cr2Se3 and Ga2Se3. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in layered chalcogenides, elucidates a direction for the rational design of multilayer stacking in solids with low &#954;lat.








Abstract
Controlling lattice vibrations to obtain intrinsic low thermal conductivity play a critical role in thermal management of electronic and photonic devices, energy converters, and thermal insulation, which necessitates exploring new compounds and a thorough understanding of their chemical structure, bonding, and lattice dynamics. Herein, a new chalcogenide, Ga6Cr5Se16, shows intrinsic low lattice thermal conductivity &#954;lat, which crystallizes in the monoclinic phase (C2/m) with the stacked inverse GaSe4 layers (g'), close&#8208;packed Cr3+Se6 layers (c), GaSe4 layers (g) and loosely&#8208;stacked Cr2+Se6 layers (c') along the c&#8208;axis. In this structure, a wide variety of chemical bonding is arranged in each layer, such as covalent Ga&#8211;Se, covalent Cr3+&#8211;Se, and weaker Cr2+&#8211;Se bonding, which endow it with a large phonon symphony by strong coupling of soft acoustic and low&#8208;lying optical phonons. As a result, Ga6Cr5Se16 realizes an intrinsic low &#954;lat of 0.79 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1 at 323 K, which is almost four times, or twice lower than that of Cr3Se4 (2.95 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), or Cr2Se3 (1.56 W m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1), Ga2Se3 (1.36 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) at 323 K, respectively. These insights will offer comprehensive understanding of the phonon propagation in complex layered chalcogenides, and&#160;also shed useful light on future design of low&#8208;&#954;lat solids.

         <title>Gas Separations using Nanoporous Atomically Thin Membranes: Recent Theoretical, Simulation, and Experimental Advances</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recent development of novel atomically thin 2D materials, including graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides, offers great opportunities for potential breakthroughs in the membrane separation field. Recent research advances, challenges, and potential future directions in the application of nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separation are summarized.








Abstract
Porous graphene and other atomically thin 2D materials are regarded as highly promising membrane materials for high&#8208;performance gas separations due to their atomic thickness, large&#8208;scale synthesizability, excellent mechanical strength, and chemical stability. When these atomically thin materials contain a high areal density of gas&#8208;sieving nanoscale pores, they can exhibit both high gas permeances and high selectivities, which is beneficial for reducing the cost of gas&#8208;separation processes. Here, recent modeling and experimental advances in nanoporous atomically thin membranes for gas separations is discussed. The major challenges involved, including controlling pore size distributions, scaling up the membrane area, and matching theory with experimental results, are also highlighted. Finally, important future directions are proposed for real gas&#8208;separation applications of nanoporous atomically thin membranes.

         <title>Carrier&#8208;Transport Mechanism in Organic Antiambipolar Transistors Unveiled by Operando Photoemission Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carrier transport in an organic antiambipolar transistor (AAT) is examined using operando photoemission electron microscopy. The approach visualizes the conductive electrons under the actual transistor operations and reveals that a lateral p&#8211;n junction is crucial for the negative differential transconductance in the AAT. These results help in enhancing&#160;the device's performance.








Abstract
Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier&#8208;transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, an operando photoemission electron microscopy is used to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during transistor operation. Notably, it is observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer shows that both p&#8208; and n&#8208;type channels have pinch&#8208;off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n&#8208;type to p&#8208;type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p&#8208;type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by &#8776;80%. This technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.

These results help in enhancing&#160;the device's performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic antiambipolar transistors (AATs) have partially overlapped p&#8211;n junctions. At room temperature, this p&#8211;n junction induces a negative differential transconductance in an AAT. However, the detailed carrier-transport mechanism remains unclear. Herein, an operando photoemission electron microscopy is used to tackle this issue owing to the technique's ability to visualize conductive electrons in real time during transistor operation. Notably, it is observed that when the AAT is on, a depletion layer forms at the lateral p&#8211;n junction. The visualized depletion layer shows that both p- and n-type channels have pinch-off states in the gate voltage range when the AAT is in on state. The steep potential gradient at the lateral p&#8211;n interface enhances the electron conduction from n-type to p-type semiconductor. Another significant finding is that most electrons are considered to recombine with the accumulated holes in the p-type semiconductor, affording the reduction of photoemission intensity by &#8776;80%. This technique provides a thorough understanding of carrier transport in AATs, further improving the device performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Interface&#8208;Modulated Resistive Switching in Mo&#8208;Irradiated ReS2 for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile Mo&#8208;irradiation doping is demonstrated for interfacial modulation of resistive switching (RS) in rhenium disulfide (ReS2) memristors, leading to a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. The device simultaneously achieves a high learning accuracy of 91% in an artificial neural network, demonstrating its potential for neuromorphic computing application.








Abstract
Coupling charge impurity scattering effects and charge&#8208;carrier modulation by doping can offer intriguing opportunities for atomic&#8208;level control of resistive switching (RS). Nonetheless, such effects have remained unexplored for memristive applications based on 2D&#160;materials. Here a facile approach is reported to transform an RS&#8208;inactive rhenium disulfide (ReS2) into an effective switching material through interfacial modulation induced by molybdenum&#8208;irradiation (Mo&#8208;i)&#160;doping. Using ReS2 as a model system, this study unveils a unique RS mechanism based on the formation/dissolution of metallic &#946;&#8208;ReO2 filament across the defective ReS2 interface during the set/reset process. Through simple interfacial modulation, ReS2 of various thicknesses are switchable by modulating the Mo&#8208;irradiation period. Besides, the Mo&#8208;irradiated ReS2 (Mo&#8208;ReS2) memristor further exhibits a bipolar non&#8208;volatile switching ratio of nearly two orders of magnitude, programmable multilevel resistance states, and long&#8208;term synaptic plasticity. Additionally, the fabricated device can achieve a high MNIST learning accuracy of 91% under a non&#8208;identical pulse train. The study's findings demonstrate the potential for modulating RS in RS&#8208;inactive 2D materials via the unique doping&#8208;induced charged impurity scattering property.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Pressure&#8208;Guided Superhydrophobic Surfaces with Adaptive Adhesion and Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface (LPGSS) is designed by combining soft caps with hard skeletons. LPGSS automatically adjusts its soft cap to achieve a dynamic balance between stability and adhesion through the guidance of liquid pressure. A series of experiments demonstrate that low surface adhesion at moderate pressure and high stability at elevated pressure can be simultaneously achieved on the surface.








Abstract
The dynamic application environments of superhydrophobic surfaces, such as in the manufacturing, chemical, and garment industries, require the fast adaptiveness of the surfaces to their surroundings. Despite the progress in materials and structural design of superhydrophobic surfaces, simultaneously achieving high superhydrophobic stability and low adhesion by traditional design is still challenging. Here, a liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surface with self&#8208;adjustable solid&#8211;liquid stability, and adhesion is demonstrated when reacting to the dynamic environmental requirements. To understand the underlying adaptive processes, the liquid impalement dynamics is imaged in three dimensions by confocal microscopy and the stability and superhydrophobicity are measured in varied systems. It is envisioned that the design strategy of liquid&#8208;pressure&#8208;guided superhydrophobic surfaces with dynamic anti&#8208;infiltration capability can stimulate the development of stable superhydrophobicity under complex wetting conditions.

         <title>Polarity&#8208;Differentiated Dielectric Materials in Monolayer Graphene Charge&#8208;Regulated Field&#8208;Effect Transistors for an Artificial Reflex Arc and Pain&#8208;Modulation System of the Spinal Cord</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with polarity&#8208;differentiated dielectric materials and a monolayer graphene channel are developed to mimic a reflex arc and pain modulation system of the spinal cord. By integrating actuators and memristors with CRFETs, reflex actions and pain sensation under noxious stimuli are realized, offering a new method to emulate the functionalities of the nervous system.








Abstract
The nervous system is a vital part of organisms to survive and it endows them with remarkable abilities, such as perception, recognition, regulation, learning, and decision&#8208;making, by intertwining myriad neurons. To realize such outstanding efficacies and functions, many artificial devices and systems have been investigated to emulate the operating principles of the nervous system. Here, an artificial reflex arc (ARA) and artificial pain modulation system (APMS) are proposed to imitate the unconscious behaviors of the spinal cord. GdxOy&#8208; and AlxOy&#8208;based charge&#8208;regulated field&#8208;effect transistors (CRFETs) with a monolayer graphene channel are fabricated and adopted as inhibitory and excitatory synapses, respectively, under the same pulse signals to mimic the biological reflex arc through a connection with a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene)&#8208;based actuator. Additionally, a memristor is integrated with a CRFET as the interneuron to regulate the Dirac point by controlling the voltage drop on the graphene channel, analogous to the descending pain&#8208;inhibition system in the spinal cord, to prevent excessive pain perception. The proposed ARA and APMS provide a significant step forward to realizing the functions of the nervous system, giving promising potential for developing future intelligent alarm systems, neuroprosthetics, and neurorobotics.

         <title>Multichannel Superposition of Grafted Perfect Vortex Beams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single metasurface is used to generate various grafted perfect vortex beams and realize the coaxial superpositions of these beams in different channels, without relying on the complicated conventional optical setup. A compact metasurface platform can perform a sophisticated task that is nearly impossible with conventional optics, opening opportunities for emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.








Abstract
Inspired by plant grafting, grafted vortex beams can be formed through grafting two or more helical phase profiles of optical vortex beams. Recently, grafted perfect vortex beams (GPVBs) have attracted much attention due to their unique optical properties and potential applications. However, the current method to generate and manipulate GPVBs requires a complex and bulky optical system, hindering further investigation and limiting its practical applications. Here, a compact metasurface approach for generating and manipulating GPVBs in multiple channels is proposed and demonstrated, which eliminates the need for such a complex optical setup. A single metasurface is utilized to realize various superpositions of GPVBs with different combinations of topological charges in four channels, leading to asymmetric singularity distributions. The positions of singularities in the superimposed beam can be further modulated by introducing an initial phase difference in the metasurface design. The work demonstrates a compact metasurface platform that performs a sophisticated optical task that is very challenging with conventional optics, opening opportunities for the investigation and applications of GPVBs in a wide range of emerging application areas, such as singular optics and quantum science.

         <title>Short&#8208;Range Diffusion Enables General Synthesis of Medium&#8208;Entropy Alloy Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A general short&#8208;range diffusion driving strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous medium entropy aerogels (MEAAs) is proposed to achieve highly efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. The well&#8208;designed MEAAs can be used for a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V, not only greatly reducing the overpotential of the traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, but also obtaining value&#8208;added formate products at anode.








Abstract
Medium&#8208;entropy alloy aerogels (MEAAs) with the advantages of both multimetallic alloys and aerogels are promising new materials in catalytic applications. However, limited by the immiscible behavior of different metals, achieving single&#8208;phase MEAAs is still a grand challenge. Herein, a general strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous MEAAs with the lowest density of 39.3 mg cm&#8722;3 among the metal materials is reported, through combining auto&#8208;combustion and subsequent low&#8208;temperature reduction procedures. The homogenous mixing of precursors at the ionic level makes the short&#8208;range diffusion of metal atoms possible to drive the formation of single&#8208;phase MEAAs. As a proof of concept in catalysis, as&#8208;synthesized Ni50Co15Fe30Cu5 MEAAs exhibit a high mass activity of 1.62 A mg&#8722;1 and specific activity of 132.24 mA cm&#8722;2 toward methanol oxidation reactions, much higher than those of the low&#8208;entropy counterparts. In situ Fourier transform infrared and NMR spectroscopies reveal that MEAAs can enable highly selective conversion of methanol to formate. Most importantly, a methanol&#8208;oxidation&#8208;assisted MEAAs&#8208;based water electrolyzer can achieve a low cell voltage of 1.476 V at 10 mA cm&#8722;2 for making value&#8208;added formate at the anode and H2 at the cathode, 173 mV lower than that of traditional alkaline water electrolyzers.

&lt;p&gt;A general short-range diffusion driving strategy for preparing ultralight 3D porous medium entropy aerogels (MEAAs) is proposed to achieve highly efficient methanol oxidation electrocatalysis. The well-designed MEAAs can be used for a methanol-oxidation-assisted water electrolyzer with a low cell voltage of 1.476&#160;V, not only greatly reducing the overpotential of the traditional alkaline water electrolyzer, but also obtaining value-added formate products at anode.

&lt;/p&gt;

         <dc:description>
A series of nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) (bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family) in situ grown on carbon cloth is fabricated in application of aqueous Ni&#8211;Zn batteries.

Abstract
Limited by single metal active sites and low electrical conductivity, designing nickel&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) materials with high capacity and high energy density remains a challenge. Herein, a series of bi/multimetallic MOF&#8208;74 family materials in situ grown on carbon cloth (CC) by doping Mx+ ions in Ni&#8208;MOF&#8208;74 is fabricated: NiM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Co2+, Cu2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+), and NiCoM&#8208;MOF@CC (M = Mn2+, Zn2+, Al3+, Fe3+). The type and ratio of doping metal ions can be adjusted while the original topology is preserved. Different metal ions are confirmed by X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (XAFS). Furthermore, these Ni&#8208;based MOF electrodes are directly utilized as cathodes for aqueous nickel&#8211;zinc batteries (NZBs). Among all the as&#8208;prepared electrodes, NiCo&#8208;MOF@CC&#8208;3 (NCM@CC&#8208;3), with an optimized Co/Ni ratio of 1:1, exhibits the best electrical conductivity, which is according to the density functional theory (DFT) theoretical calculations. The NCM@CC&#8208;3//Zn@CC battery achieves a high specific capacity of 1.77 mAh cm&#8211;2, a high areal energy density of 2.97 mWh cm&#8211;2, and high cycling stability of 83% capacity retention rate after 6000 cycles. The synthetic strategy based on the coordination effect of metal ions and the concept of binder&#8208;free electrodes provide a new direction for the synthesis of high&#8208;performance materials in the energy&#8208;storage field.

         <dc:description>
A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202) accelerates the hydrogen production by water electrolysis and records industrially desired operational stability over a wide range of pH compared to the commercial catalyst platinum on carbon.

Abstract
The discovery of novel materials for industrial&#8208;standard hydrogen production is the present need considering the global energy infrastructure. A novel electrocatalyst, Pt3Ge, which is engineered with a desired crystallographic facet (202), accelerates hydrogen production by water electrolysis, and records industrially desired operational stability compared to the commercial catalyst platinum is introduced. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) exhibits low overpotential of 21.7 mV (24.6 mV for Pt/C) and 92 mV for 10 and 200 mA cm&#8722;2 current density, respectively in 0.5 m H2SO4. It also exhibits remarkable stability of 15&#160;000 accelerated degradation tests cycles (5000 for Pt/C) and exceptional durability of 500 h (@10 mA cm&#8722;2) in acidic media. Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) also displays low overpotential of 96 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 current density in the alkaline medium, rationalizing its hydrogen production ability over a wide pH range required commercial operations. Long&#8208;term durability (&gt;75 h in alkaline media) with the industrial level current density (&gt;500 mA cm&#8722;2) has been demonstrated by utilizing the electrochemical flow reactor. The driving force behind this stupendous performance of Pt3Ge&#8208;(202) has been envisaged by mapping the reaction mechanism, active sites, and charge&#8208;transfer kinetics via controlled electrochemical experiments, ex situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, in situ infrared spectroscopy, and in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy further corroborated by first principles calculations.

         <title>Neuromorphic Photonic Memory Devices Using Ultrafast, Non&#8208;volatile Phase&#8208;change Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The search for ultra&#8208;fast photonic memory devices is inspired by the ever&#8208;increasing number of cloud computing, supercomputing, and artificial intelligence applications, together with the unique advantages of signal processing in the optical domain such as high speed, large bandwidth, and low energy consumption. By embracing silicon photonics with chalcogenide phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs), non&#8208;volatile integrated photonic memory has been developed with promising potential in photonic integrated circuits and nanophotonic applications. While conventional PCMs suffer from slow crystallization speed, scandium&#8208;doped antimony telluride (SST) has recently been developed for ultrafast phase&#8208;change random&#8208;access memory applications. We demonstrate an ultrafast non&#8208;volatile photonic memory based on an SST thin film with a 2&#8208;ns write/erase speed&#8212;which is the fastest write/erase speed ever reported in integrated phase&#8208;change photonic devices. SST&#8208;based photonic memories exhibit multi&#8208;level capabilities and good stability at room temperature. By mapping the memory level to the biological synapse weight, an artificial neural network based on photonic memory devices is successfully established for image classification. Additionally, we demonstrate a reflective nanodisplay application using SST with optoelectronic modulation capabilities. Both the optical and electrical changes in SST during the phase transition and the fast&#8208;switching speed demonstrate their potential for use in photonic computing, neuromorphic computing, nanophotonics, and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Nonvolatile control of metal&#8208;insulator transition in VO2 by ferroelectric gating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Controlling phase transitions in correlated materials yields emergent functional properties, providing new aspects to future electronics and a fundamental understanding of condensed matter systems. With vanadium dioxide (VO2), a representative correlated material, we develop an approach to control a metal&#8208;insulator transition (MIT) behavior by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO3 (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect&#8208;alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO2 at room temperature. The ferroelectrically&#8208;tunable MIT could be realized through the Mott transistor (VO2/BFO/SrRuO3) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#956;Ccm&#8211;2, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8764;102), long retention time (&#8764;104 s), and high endurance (&#8764;103 cycles). Furthermore, we corroborate the structural phase transition of VO2 by ferroelectric polarization through in&#8208;situ Raman mapping analysis. Our study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.

With vanadium dioxide (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), a representative correlated material, we develop an approach to control a metal-insulator transition (MIT) behavior by employing a heteroepitaxial structure with a ferroelectric BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (BFO) layer to modulate the interaction of correlated electrons. Owing to the defect-alleviated interfaces, the enhanced coupling between the correlated electrons and ferroelectric polarization is successfully demonstrated by showing a nonvolatile control of MIT of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature. The ferroelectrically-tunable MIT could be realized through the Mott transistor (VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/BFO/SrRuO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) with a remanent polarization of 80 &#956;Ccm&lt;sup&gt;&#8211;2&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a nonvolatile MIT behavior through the reversible electrical conductance with a large on/off ratio (&#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), long retention time (&#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; s), and high endurance (&#8764;10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; cycles). Furthermore, we corroborate the structural phase transition of VO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by ferroelectric polarization through &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; Raman mapping analysis. Our study provides novel design principles for heteroepitaxial correlated materials and innovative insight to modulate multifunctional properties.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Stretchable and Biodegradable Batteries with High Energy and Power Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Realizing a sustainable, technologically advanced future will necessitate solving the electronic waste problem. Biodegradable forms of electronics offer a viable path through their environmental benignity. With both the sheer number of devices produced every day as well as their areas of application ever increasing, new concepts of degradable batteries able to sustain the high power demands of modern electronics must be developed. Simultaneously, integration of electronics in close interaction with its user or powering soft robotic devices necessitates high degrees of compliance, rendering stretchable batteries indispensable. Here, a concept for merging intrinsically stretchable materials with engineered stretchability by kirigami&#8208;patterning on a component level is shown to yield high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries with reversible elasticity up to 35% when stretched uniaxially and 20% for biaxial extension. Using a combination of molybdenum metal foils, a molybdenum trioxide paste and magnesium metal foils as electrode materials, a peak power output of 196 &#956;W cm&#8211;2 and an energy density of 1.72 mWh cm&#8211;2 is achieved. The biodegradable batteries are used to power an on&#8208;skin biomedical sensor patch, enabling monitoring of sodium concentration in sweat. This concept provides a versatile route for high&#8208;power biodegradable batteries, enabling untethered soft electronic devices in a sustainable future.

         <title>Construction of N, P Co&#8208;Doped Carbon Frames Anchored with Fe Single Atoms and Fe2P Nanoparticles as a Robust Coupling Catalyst for Electrocatalytic Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphidation strategy is discovered for the synthesis of well&#8208;defined Fe single atoms&#8211;Fe2P nanoparticles/N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames catalyst, and a new concept of &#8220;atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers&#8221; for electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction is put forward.








Abstract
A coupling catalyst of highly dispersed N, P co&#8208;doped carbon frames (NPCFs) anchored with Fe single atoms (SAs) and Fe2P nanoparticles (NPs) is synthesized by a novel in situ doping&#8211;adsorption&#8211;phosphatization strategy for the electrocatalytic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). The optimized Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst shows a superior ORR activity and stability in 0.5 m H2SO4 and 0.1 m KOH, respectively. Theoretical calculations reveal a synergistic effect, in that the existence of Fe2P weakens the adsorption of ORR intermediates on active sites and lowers the reaction free energy. The doped P atoms with a strong electron&#8208;donating ability elevate the energy level of Fe&#8208;3d orbitals and facilitate the adsorption of O2. The active Fe atoms exist in a low oxidation state and are less positively charged, and they serve as an electron reservoir capable of donating and releasing electrons, thus improving the ORR activity. Operando and in situ characterization results indicate that the atomically dispersed Fe&#63743;N4/Fe&#63743;P coupled active centers in the Fe SAs&#8208;Fe2P NPs/NPCFs&#8208;2.5 catalyst are characteristic of the different catalytic mechanisms in acidic and alkaline media. This work proposes a novel idea for constructing coupling catalysts with atomic&#8208;level precision and provides a strong reference for the development of high&#8208;efficiency ORR electrocatalysts for practical application.

         <title>Dangling Octahedra Enable Edge States in 2D Lead Halide Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low&#8208;energy and long&#8208;lived edge states of 2D lead halide perovskites arise from the rotational symmetry elevation at the crystal layer edges, which are enabled by dangling PbBr6 octahedra at the lattice terminals. These dangling octahedra with enhanced atomic vibrations can give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective electron transport from the interior to layer edges.








Abstract
The structural reconstruction at the crystal layer edges of 2D lead halide perovskites (LHPs) leads to unique edge states (ES), which are manifested by prolonged carrier lifetime and reduced emission energy. These special ES&#160;can effectively enhance the optoelectronic performance of devices, but their intrinsic origin and working mechanism remain elusive. Here it is demonstrated that the ES of a family of 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper LHPs [BA2CsPb2Br7, BA2MAPb2Br7, and BA2MA2Pb3Br10 (BA = butylammonium; MA = methylammonium)] arise from the rotational symmetry elevation of the PbBr6 octahedra dangling at the crystal layer edges. These dangling octahedra give rise to localized electronic states that enable an effective transport of electrons from the interior to layer edges, and the population of electrons in both the interior states and the ES can be manipulated via controlling the external fields. Moreover, the abundant phonons, activated by the dangling octahedra, can interact with electrons to facilitate radiative recombination, counterintuitive to the suppressive role commonly observed in conventional semiconductors. This work unveils the intrinsic atomistic and electronic origins of ES in 2D LHPs, which can stimulate the exploration of ES&#8208;based exotic optoelectronic properties and the corresponding design of high&#8208;performance devices for these emergent low&#8208;dimensional semiconductors.

         <title>Structural Dynamics and Tunability for Colloidal Tin Halide Perovskite Nanostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesis of stable, tunable, and monodisperse colloidal CsSnI3 nanocrystals or a mixture of 3D CsSnI3 nanocrystals and 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 perovskite nanosheets is reported. The key factor in this chemical design is the nucleation and growth of the CsSnI3 nanocrystals from (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskite nanocrystals are highly attractive for next&#8208;generation optoelectronics because they are easy to synthesize and offer great compositional and morphological tunability. However, the replacement of lead by tin for sustainability reasons is hampered by the unstable nature of Sn2+ oxidation state and by an insufficient understanding of the chemical processes involved in the synthesis. Here, an optimized synthetic route is demonstrated to obtain stable, tunable, and monodisperse CsSnI3 nanocrystals, exhibiting well&#8208;defined excitonic peaks. Similar to lead halide perovskites, these nanocrystals are prepared by combining a precursor mixture of SnI2, oleylamine, and oleic acid, with a Cs&#8208;oleate precursor. Among the products, nanocrystals with 10&#160;nm lateral size in the &#947;&#8208;orthorhombic phase prove to be the most stable. To achieve such stability, an excess of precursor SnI2 as well as substoichiometric Sn:ligand ratios are key. Structural, compositional, and optical investigations complemented by first&#8208;principle density functional theory calculations confirm that nanocrystal nucleation and growth follow the formation of (R&#8208;NH3+)2SnI4 nanosheets, with R = C18H35. Under specific synthetic conditions, stable mixtures of 3D nanocrystals CsSnI3 and 2D nanosheets (Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (R&#8208;NH3+)2Csn&#8722;1SnnI3n+1 with n&#160;&gt; 1) are obtained. These results set a path to exploiting the high potential of Sn halide perovskite nanocrystals for opto&#8208;electronic applications.

         <title>Raman Scattering Measurement of Suspended Graphene under Extreme Strain Induced by Nanoindentation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High strains are applied to single&#8208;layer graphene by an atomic force microscopy (AFM) tip and the Raman signals are obtained simultaneously using a Raman&#8211;AFM system. Graphene is stretched up to 6.1% and the G and 2D bands of Raman signal are shifted by 277 and 660 cm&#8722;1 respectively, which are unprecedented values.








Abstract
Graphene is known as a superstiff and extremely strong material. Hence, applying strains greater than 1% to graphene and simultaneously measuring changes in its physical properties has been challenging because of the limited methodologies for measuring both high strain and other physical properties. Here, Raman scattering measurement of suspended graphene under extremely high biaxial strain as large as 6.1% using an atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8211;Raman spectroscopy measurement tool is reported. Nanoindentation is performed using AFM tips machined to have a flat top and a hole shape, resulting in a strained graphene area sufficiently large to enable the acquisition of a Raman signal. At the same time, the laser light is focused on the strained flat area of the graphene membrane. The Raman signals of the G and 2D bands of graphene are redshifted by 282 and 684 cm&#8722;1, respectively, which is unprecedented for graphene. This measurement technique provides an effective methodology to measure variations in the physical properties of atomically thin materials under superhigh strain.

         <title>Brushed Metals for Rechargeable Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Battery designs are swiftly changing from metal&#8208;ion to rechargeable metal batteries. Theoretically, metals can deliver maximum anode capacity and enable cells with improved energy density. In practice, these advantages are only possible if the parasitic surface reactions associated with metal anodes are controlled. These undesirable surface reactions are responsible for many troublesome issues, like dendrite formation and accelerated consumption of active materials, which leads to anodes with low cycle life or even battery runaway. Here, we report a facile and solvent&#8208;free brushing method to convert powders into films atop Li and Na metal foils. Benefiting from the reactivity of Li metal with these powder films, surface energy can be effectively tuned, thereby preventing parasitic reaction. In&#8208;operando study of P2S5&#8208;Li anodes in liquid electrolyte cells reveals a smoother electrode contour and more uniform Li metal electrodeposition and dissolution behavior during cycling. The P2S5&#8208;Li anodes sustain ultralow polarization in symmetric cell for &gt;4000 h, &#8764;8&#215; longer than bare Li anodes. The capacity retention is &#8764;70% higher when P2S5&#8208;Li anodes are paired with a practical LiFePO4 cathode (&#8764;3.2 mAh cm&#8211;2) after 340 cycles. Brush coating opens a promising avenue to fabricate large&#8208;scale artificial solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase directly on metals without the need for organic solvent.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the development of physical shadow growth techniques to realize various 3D hybrid plasmonic nanoparticles and structures is summarized. Such nanoparticles and structures can be engineered in their shape and material composition so that they exhibit unique plasmonic properties. Novel functions and potential fields of application including photonic devices, biomedical applications, and chiral spectroscopy are highlighted.








Abstract
Physical shadow growth is a vacuum deposition technique that permits a wide variety of 3D&#8208;shaped nanoparticles and structures to be fabricated from a large library of materials. Recent advances in the control of the shadow effect at the nanoscale expand the scope of nanomaterials from spherical nanoparticles to complex 3D shaped hybrid nanoparticles and structures. In particular, plasmonically active nanomaterials can be engineered in their shape and material composition so that they exhibit unique physical and chemical properties. Here, the recent progress in the development of shadow growth techniques to realize hybrid plasmonic nanomaterials is discussed. The review describes how fabrication permits the material response to be engineered and highlights novel functions. Potential fields of application with a focus on photonic devices, biomedical, and chiral spectroscopic applications are discussed.

         <title>Biaxially Compressive Strain in Ni/Ru Core/Shell Nanoplates Boosts Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates are developed as advanced catalysts to boost the performance of lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries. It is demonstrated that strain effect can tune the electronic structure of ruthenium, which makes the strained ruthenium shell energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of lithium carbonate crystals.








Abstract
Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in rechargeable Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8776;5.1% and &#8776;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8722;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. It is demonstrated that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO2 reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;CO2 battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&#8722;1 with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&#8722;1). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d&#8208;band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO2 molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li2CO3 crystals during the discharge and charge processes. This study confirms that strain engineering, though constructing a well&#8208;defined core/shell structure, is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru&#8208;based materials in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries.

&lt;p&gt;Biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates are developed as advanced catalysts to boost the performance of lithium&#8211;carbon dioxide batteries. It is demonstrated that strain effect can tune the electronic structure of ruthenium, which makes the strained ruthenium shell energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of lithium carbonate crystals.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Regulating surface strain of nanomaterials is an effective strategy to manipulate the activity of catalysts, yet not well recognized in rechargeable Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. Herein, biaxially compressive strained nickel/ruthenium core/shell hexagonal nanoplates (Ni/Ru HNPs) with lattice compression of &#8776;5.1% and &#8776;3.2% in the Ru {10&#8722;10} and (0002) facets are developed as advanced catalysts for Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries. It is demonstrated that tuning the electronic structure of Ru shell through biaxially compressive strain engineering can boost the kinetically sluggish CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction and evolution reactions, thus achieving a high-performance Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery with low charge platform/overpotential (3.75&#160;V/0.88&#160;V) and ultralong cycling life (120 cycles at 200&#160;mA g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with a fixed capacity of 1000 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;). Density functional theory calculations reveal that the biaxially compressive strain can downshift the d-band center of surface Ru atoms and thus weaken the binding of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules, which is energetically beneficial for the nucleation and decomposition of Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; crystals during the discharge and charge processes. This study confirms that strain engineering, though constructing a well-defined core/shell structure, is a promising strategy to improve the inherent catalytic activity of Ru-based materials in Li&#8211;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Direct Light Orbital Angular Momentum Detection in Mid&#8208;Infrared Based on the Type&#8208;II Weyl Semimetal TaIrTe4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the orbital angular momentum (OAM) order of the vertex beam in the mid&#8208;infrared wavelength. The helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number.








Abstract
The direct photocurrent detection capability of light orbital angular momentum (OAM) has recently been realized with topological Weyl semimetals, but it is limited to the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. The extension of the direct OAM detection capability to the mid&#8208;infrared band, which is a wave band that plays an important role in a vast range of applications, has not yet been realized. This is because the photocurrent responses of most photodetectors are neither sensitive to the phase information nor efficient in the mid&#8208;infrared region. In this study, a photodetector based on the type&#8208;II Weyl semimetal tantalum iridium telluride (TaIrTe4) is designed with peculiar electrode geometries to directly detect the topological charge of the OAM using the orbital photogalvanic effect (OPGE). The results indicate that the helical phase gradient of light can be distinguished by a current winding around the optical beam axis, with a magnitude proportional to its quantized OAM mode number. The topologically enhanced responses in the mid&#8208;infrared region of TaIrTe4 further help overcome the low responsivity issues and finally render direct OAM detection capability. This study enables on&#8208;chip&#8208;integrated OAM detection, and thus OAM&#8208;sensitive focal plane arrays in the mid&#8208;infrared region.

         <title>Highly Potassiophilic Graphdiyne Skeletons Decorated with Cu Quantum Dots Enable Dendrite&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An Al current collector modified by hierarchical N&#8208;doped carbon and graphdiyne composites is beneficial to reducing the local current density and increasing the potassiophilic sites, accordingly enabling excellent electrochemical performance for dendrite&#8208;free K&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Employing an Al foil current collector at the potassium anode side is an ideal choice to entail low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;energy potassium&#8208;metal batteries (PMBs). Nevertheless, the poor affinity between the potassium and the planar Al can cause uneven K plating/stripping and, hence, an undermined anode performance, which remains a significant challenge to be addressed. Herein, a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon@graphdiyne (NC@GDY)&#8208;modified Al current collector affording potassiophilic properties is proposed, which simultaneously suppresses the dendrite growth and prolongs the lifespan of K anodes. The thin and light modification layer (7&#160;&#181;m thick, with a mass loading of 500&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2) is fabricated by directly growing GDY nanosheets interspersed with Cu quantum dots on NC polyhedron templates. As a result, symmetric cell tests reveal that the K@NC@GDY&#8208;Al electrode exhibits an unprecedented cycle life of over 2400 h at a 40% depth of discharge. Even at an 80% depth of discharge, the cell can still sustain for 850 h. When paired with a potassium Prussian blue cathode, the thus&#8208;assembled full cell demonstrates comparable capacity and rate performance with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PMBs.

         <title>Multiphoton Lithography of Organic Semiconductor Devices for 3D Printing of Flexible Electronic Circuits, Biosensors, and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D printing of flexible microelectronics has gained significant attention. In this work, a photosensitive resin doped with organic semiconductor material is developed for direct laser writing based on multiphoton lithography. Fabrication of microelectronic devices, hybrid microelectrodes, cell&#8208;adhesive substrates, and high&#8208;performance glucose biosensors are successfully demonstrated. These soft and conductive microstructures have potential in flexible electronics, organic bioelectronics, and biosensors.








Abstract
In recent years, 3D printing of electronics have received growing attention due to their potential applications in emerging fields such as nanoelectronics and nanophotonics. Multiphoton lithography (MPL) is considered the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art amongst the microfabrication techniques with true 3D fabrication capability owing to its excellent level of spatial and temporal control. Here, a homogenous and transparent photosensitive resin doped with an organic semiconductor material (OS), which is compatible with MPL process, is introduced to fabricate a variety of 3D OS composite microstructures (OSCMs) and microelectronic devices. Inclusion of 0.5 wt% OS in the resin enhances the electrical conductivity of the composite polymer about 10 orders of magnitude and compared to other MPL&#8208;based methods, the resultant OSCMs offer high specific electrical conductivity. As a model protein, laminin is incorporated into these OSCMs without a significant loss of activity. The OSCMs are biocompatible and support cell adhesion and growth. Glucose&#8208;oxidase&#8208;encapsulated OSCMs offer a highly sensitive glucose sensing platform with nearly tenfold higher sensitivity compared to previous glucose biosensors. In addition, this biosensor exhibits excellent specificity and high reproducibility. Overall, these results demonstrate the great potential of these novel MPL&#8208;fabricated OSCM devices for a wide range of applications from flexible bioelectronics/biosensors, to nanoelectronics and organ&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices.

         <dc:description>
Ultrathin MgF2 nanosheets encapsulated inside N&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like hollow nanospheres are prepared by the perfect combination of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition. In situ optical microscopy, in situ transmission electron microscopy, and theoretical calculations are used to investigate the deposition behavior and mechanism in detail. The Li&#8208;metal batteries based on the designed composite anode demonstrate superior electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Uncontrolled lithium dendrite growth and dramatic volume change during cycling have long been severely impeding the practical applications of Li metal as the ultimate anode. In this work, ultrathin MgF2 nanosheets encapsulated inside nitrogen&#8208;doped graphene&#8208;like hollow nanospheres (MgF2 NSs@NGHSs) are ingeniously fabricated to address these problems by a perfect combination of atomic layer deposition and chemical vapor deposition. The uniform and continuous Li&#8211;Mg solid&#8208;solution inner layer formed by the MgF2 nanosheets can reduce the nucleation overpotential and induce selective deposition of Li into the cavities of the NGHSs. Furthermore, the Li deposition behavior and mechanism of the hybrid host are comprehensively explored by in situ optical microscopy at the macroscopic level, in situ transmission electron microscopy at the microscopic level, and theoretical calculations at the atomic level, respectively. Benefiting from a synergistic modulation strategy of nanosheet seed&#8208;induced nucleation and Li&#8208;confined growth, the designed composite demonstrates an endurance of 590 cycles for asymmetric cells and a lifespan over 1330 h for corresponding symmetric cells. When applied in LiFePO4 full cells, it provides a reversible capacity of 90.6 mAh g&#8722;1 after 1000 cycles at 1 C.

         <title>Unconventional Spin Pumping and Magnetic Damping in an Insulating Compensated Ferrimagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An unconventional spin pumping (SP) together with the divergent nonlocal magnetic damping is unambiguously reported in compensated ferrimagnetic Gd3Fe5O12&#8208;based heterostructures. The coherent and incoherent spin currents undergo a distinct direction change with the variation of temperature. The underlying physical mechanisms are self&#8208;consistently clarified by the ferrimagnetic counterpart of SP and the handedness&#8208;related spin&#8208;wave spectra.








Abstract
Recently, the interest in spin pumping (SP) has escalated from ferromagnets into antiferromagnetic systems, potentially enabling fundamental physics and magnonic applications. Compensated ferrimagnets are considered alternative platforms for bridging ferro&#8208; and antiferromagnets, but their SP and the associated magnetic damping have been largely overlooked so far despite their seminal importance for magnonics. Herein, an unconventional SP together with magnetic damping in an insulating compensated ferrimagnet Gd3Fe5O12 (GdIG) is reported. Remarkably, the divergence of the nonlocal effective magnetic damping induced by SP close to the compensation temperature in GdIG/Cu/Pt heterostructures is identified unambiguously. Furthermore, the coherent and incoherent spin currents, generated by SP and the spin Seebeck effect, respectively, undergo a distinct direction change with the variation of temperature. The physical mechanisms underlying these observations are self&#8208;consistently clarified by the ferrimagnetic counterpart of SP and the handedness&#8208;related spin&#8208;wave spectra. The findings broaden the conventional paradigm of the ferromagnetic SP model and open new opportunities for exploring the ferrimagnetic magnonic devices.

         <title>An Artificial Tactile Neuron Enabling Spiking Representation of Stiffness and Disease Diagnosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial tactile neuron that encodes the stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns is developed using an ovonic threshold switch and a piezoresistive sensor. The spiking&#8208;represented stiffness of soft materials with varying stiffness in a combination of spiking neural network&#8208;based learning enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%.








Abstract
Mechanical properties of biological systems provide useful information about the biochemical status of cells and tissues. Here, an artificial tactile neuron enabling spiking representation of stiffness and spiking neural network (SNN)&#8208;based learning for disease diagnosis is reported. An artificial spiking tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch serving as an artificial soma and a piezoresistive sensor as an artificial mechanoreceptor is developed and shown to encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike frequency evolution patterns. SNN&#8208;based learning of ultrasound elastography images abstracted by spike frequency evolution rate enables the classification of malignancy status of breast tumors with a recognition accuracy up to 95.8%. The stiffness&#8208;encoding artificial tactile neuron and learning of spiking&#8208;represented stiffness patterns hold a great promise for the identification and classification of tumors for disease diagnosis and robot&#8208;assisted surgery with low power consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.

         <title>Deterministic Assembly of Colloidal Quantum Dots for Multifunctional Integrated Photonics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deterministic patterning of colloidal quantum dots into high&#8208;quality micro&#8208;/nanostructures is developed for the construction of multifunctional integrated photonic devices. Mode&#8208;tunable microlasers and waveguides are coupled to direct on&#8208;chip generation and propagation of coherent light, which permits a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of integrated photonic circuits for encoding photonic outputs into information bits.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising for photonic applications toward lasers, waveguides, and photodetectors. However, integration of high&#8208;quality photonic elements into multifunctional devices is still restricted by optical losses stemming from the accumulation of defects and disorder in the solution process. Herein, a platform with a directional Laplace pressure is created for eliminating undesired pinning of liquid fronts in the solution process and boosting ordered assembly of CQDs into designable micro&#8208;/nanostructures. The versatility and robustness of this method are demonstrated by deterministic patterning of CQDs with different components and photoluminescence spectra onto various substrates. On the basis of this platform, microring lasers with tunable emission modes, low&#8208;loss waveguides, and their coupled structures have been reached for direct on&#8208;chip generation and propagation of coherent light. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration of integrated circuits is also conducted by combining microcavity lasers with waveguides for encoding photonic outputs into information bits.

         <title>Combinatorial Polyacrylamide Hydrogels for Preventing Biofouling on Implantable Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogel formulations that prevent protein and platelet adhesion in assays where &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; polymers exhibit significant platelet adhesion are identified. By using machine&#8208;learning techniques to analyze molecular features of the polyacrylamide&#8208;based copolymers, features giving rise to this anti&#8208;biofouling performance are identified. Coating electrochemical devices with these top&#8208;performing polyacrylamide&#8208;based hydrogels extend lifetime when implanted intravenously and enable in vivo real&#8208;time monitoring of analytes.








Abstract
Biofouling on the surface of implanted medical devices and biosensors severely hinders device functionality and drastically shortens device lifetime. Poly(ethylene glycol) and zwitterionic polymers are currently considered &#8220;gold&#8208;standard&#8221; device coatings to reduce biofouling. To discover novel anti&#8208;biofouling materials, a combinatorial library of polyacrylamide&#8208;based copolymer hydrogels is created, and their ability is screened to prevent fouling from serum and platelet&#8208;rich plasma in a high&#8208;throughput parallel assay. It is found that certain nonintuitive copolymer compositions exhibit superior anti&#8208;biofouling&#160;properties over current gold&#8208;standard materials, and machine learning is used to identify key molecular features underpinning their performance. For validation, the surfaces of electrochemical biosensors are coated with hydrogels and their anti&#8208;biofouling performance in vitro and in vivo in rodent models is evaluated. The copolymer hydrogels preserve device function and enable continuous measurements of a small&#8208;molecule drug in vivo better than gold&#8208;standard coatings. The novel methodology described enables the discovery of anti&#8208;biofouling materials that can extend the lifetime of real&#8208;time in vivo sensing devices.

         <title>Electrochemical On&#8208;Site Switching of the Directional Liquid Transport on a Conical Fiber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
On&#8208;site switchable directional liquid transport on a conical fiber (DLT&#8208;CF) is realized by a facile electrochemical strategy. The droplet dynamic on a conical fiber can be switched between moving and pinning by applying and removing an electric potential. Taking advantages, various controllable DLT&#8208;CFs are demonstrated, including those with tunable transport distance, array manipulation, and assembly&#8208;line processing.








Abstract
Directional liquid transport (DLT), especially that proceeding on a conical fiber (DLT&#8208;CF), is an important mass&#8208;transfer process widely used both by natural organisms and in practical applications. However, on&#8208;site switching of the DLT&#8208;CF remains a challenge due to the nontunable driving force imparted by the structural gradient, which greatly limits its application. Here, unprecedently, a facile electrochemical strategy is developed for reaching the on&#8208;site switchable DLT&#8208;CF, featuring in situ control and fast response. Depending on the poised electric potential, the droplet can either move directionally or be pinned at any position for a tunable duration time, exhibiting completely different moving characteristics from the traditional DLT&#8208;CF with no control. It is proposed that the surface hysteresis resistance, closely related to both the surface hydrogen&#8208;bonding network and the droplet topology on the fiber, can be largely altered electrochemically. The tunable hysteresis resistance works synergistically with the conical&#8208;structure&#8208;induced Laplace pressure to on&#8208;site tune the forces acting on the droplet, leading to various controllable DLTs&#8208;CF, including those with tunable distance and direction, array manipulation, and assembly line processing of droplets. The strategy is applicable for versatile liquids, offering a general approach for controllable liquid transport in fibrous systems.

However, on-site switching of the DLT-CF remains a challenge due to the nontunable driving force imparted by the structural gradient, which greatly limits its application. Here, unprecedently, a facile electrochemical strategy is developed for reaching the on-site switchable DLT-CF, featuring in situ control and fast response. Depending on the poised electric potential, the droplet can either move directionally or be pinned at any position for a tunable duration time, exhibiting completely different moving characteristics from the traditional DLT-CF with no control. It is proposed that the surface hysteresis resistance, closely related to both the surface hydrogen-bonding network and the droplet topology on the fiber, can be largely altered electrochemically. The tunable hysteresis resistance works synergistically with the conical-structure-induced Laplace pressure to on-site tune the forces acting on the droplet, leading to various controllable DLTs-CF, including those with tunable distance and direction, array manipulation, and assembly line processing of droplets. The strategy is applicable for versatile liquids, offering a general approach for controllable liquid transport in fibrous systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 Membranes with Robust Ferroelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of centimeter&#8208;scale, crack&#8208;free, freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanomembranes is reported, and their robust ferroelectricity is confirmed. By transferring freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 membranes to transmission electron microscopy grids, the phases, orientations, grain&#8208;size distributions, and grain boundaries are atomically characterized from plan&#8208;view. This work opens a new paradigm for exploring the complex structures and unconventional ferroelectricity in polymorphic Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 using plan&#8208;view imaging.








Abstract
Hafnia&#8208;based compounds have considerable potential for use in nanoelectronics due to their compatibility with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor devices and robust ferroelectricity at nanoscale sizes. However, the unexpected ferroelectricity in this class of compounds often remains elusive due to the polymorphic nature of hafnia, as well as the lack of suitable methods for the characterization of the mixed/complex phases in hafnia thin films. Herein, the preparation of centimeter&#8208;scale, crack&#8208;free, freestanding Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 (HZO) nanomembranes that are well suited for investigating the local crystallographic phases, orientations, and grain boundaries at both the microscopic and mesoscopic scales is reported. Atomic&#8208;level imaging of the plan&#8208;view crystallographic patterns shows that more than 80% of the grains are the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase, and that the mean equivalent diameter of these grains is about 12.1&#160;nm, with values ranging from 4 to 50&#160;nm. Moreover, the ferroelectric orthorhombic phase is stable in substrate&#8208;free HZO membranes, indicating that strain from the substrate is not responsible for maintaining the polar phase. It is also demonstrated that HZO capacitors prepared on flexible substrates are highly uniform, stable, and robust. These freestanding membranes provide a viable platform for the exploration of HZO polymorphic films with complex structures and pave the way to flexible nanoelectronics.

         <title>An Optical/Ferroelectric Multiplexing Multidimensional Nonvolatile Memory from Ferroelectric Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
By using atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy as a nano&#8208;optical writing/readout tool, a novel optical/ferroelectric multiplexing poly(vinylidene fluoride) memory with independent four&#8208;level optical and bilevel ferroelectric signals is demonstrated. The different temperature tolerance of phase change and polarization switching enables an integration of optical read&#8208;only memory and ferroelectric random access. This work opens up new opportunities for high density and security data storage.








Abstract
Multiplexing physical dimensions to realize multidimensional storage in a single material has been a goal to increase storage density and data security. Multidimensional storage is only achieved in optical storage material (OSM) by far. Poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF), a semicrystalline polymer, is widely studied as a candidate for ferroelectric random access (FeRAM). Herein, the atomic force microscopy (AFM)&#8208;based infrared spectroscopy techniqueis used to induce multilevel phase transformations in PVDF ultrathin film on nanometric scales and for writing/readout of IR signals. An optical/ferroelectric multiplexing PVDF memory, where information can be coded with independent four&#8208;level optical IR and bilevel ferroelectric signals, is demonstrated. High data security and a storage density up to 180 GBit in.&#8722;2 are achieved simultaneously. Owing to the different critical temperature for phase transformation (optical data, &lt;167&#160;&#176;C) and polarization switching (ferroelectric data, &lt;100&#160;&#176;C), the multiplexing memory can function both as optical read&#8208;only memory and FeRAM. This work expands material supporting physical dimensions multiplexing beyond OSM for the first time, opening up new opportunities for future high&#8208;capacity, multifunctional nano&#8208;memory. The strategy proposed here enables on&#8208;demand and tunable programming on IR waves, offering prospects for fabrication of active nano&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>A Real&#8208;Time Self&#8208;Adaptive Thermal Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;adaptive metasurface platform for real&#8208;time thermal regulation is presented. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept platform experimentally demonstrates arbitrary switching between elaborate thermal patterns consolidated into an active thermoelectric element matrix.

Abstract
Emerging metamaterials have served as an efficient strategy for the realization of unconventional heat control and management using structural thermal properties, and many functional thermal metadevices have been investigated. However, thermal functions are usually fixed or limited in the switching range. Thus far, real&#8208;time thermal regulation is elusive for thermal metamaterials because of deterministic artificial metastructures and uncontrollable phase transitions, coupled with the absence of dynamic adaptability. Here, a self&#8208;adaptive metasurface platform to implement programmable thermal functions via the automatic evolution of thermoelectric heat sources and real&#8208;time control of the driven voltage is reported. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept smart platform experimentally demonstrates arbitrary switching between elaborate thermal patterns consolidated into an active thermoelectric element matrix. Further, thermal pixels and feedback control systems are integrated into printed circuit boards, resulting in self&#8208;adaptability to any thermal requirements. This study sets up a new paradigm for arbitrary transitions between exquisite thermal patterns and is expected to pave the way for real&#8208;time thermal management in a programming formation.

         <title>A Heterogeneously Integrated Spiking Neuron Array for Multimode&#8208;Fused Perception and Object Classification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An artificial multimodal sensory system based on a multimode&#8208;fused spiking neuron (MFSN) is reported. The MFSN is capable of multimodal sensing, data fusion, and spiking conversion through heterogeneous integration of pressure sensors and memristors. The application feasibility of the system is demonstrated through enhanced pattern recognition and object classification. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MFSNs contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Multimode&#8208;fused sensing in the somatosensory system helps people obtain comprehensive object properties and make accurate judgments. However, building such multisensory systems with conventional metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technology presents serious device integration and circuit complexity challenges. Here, a multimode&#8208;fused spiking neuron (MFSN) with a compact structure to achieve human&#8208;like multisensory perception is reported. The MFSN heterogeneously integrates a pressure sensor to process pressure and a NbOx&#8208;based memristor to sense temperature. Using this MFSN, multisensory analog information can be fused into one spike train, showing excellent data compression and conversion capabilities. Moreover, both pressure and temperature information are distinguished from fused spikes by decoupling the output frequencies and amplitudes, supporting multimodal tactile perception. Then, a 3 &#215; 3 MFSN array is fabricated, and the fused frequency patterns are fed into a spiking neural network for enhanced tactile pattern recognition. Finally, a larger MFSN array is simulated for classifying objects with different shapes, temperatures, and weights, validating the feasibility of the MFSNs for practical applications. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept MFSNs enable the building of multimodal sensory systems and contribute to the development of highly intelligent robotics.

         <title>Nanocube Epitaxy for the Realization of Printable Monocrystalline Nanophotonic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new paradigm to fabricate printable monocrystalline gold nanostructures with an arbitrary geometry is demonstrated using nanocubes as building blocks. A careful balance of oxidation and reduction processes at their surface allows liquid&#8208;phase epitaxy with extensive morphology control at near&#8208;ambient temperature. An extended monocrystalline nanophotonics array of the highest quality can be printed from poly(dimethylsiloxane) to any receiving substrate.








Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles of the highest quality can be obtained via colloidal synthesis at low&#8208;cost. Despite the strong potential for integration in nanophotonic devices, the geometry of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles is mostly limited to that of platonic solids. This is in stark contrast to nanostructures obtained by top&#8208;down methods that offer unlimited capability for plasmon resonance engineering, but present poor material quality and have doubtful perspectives for scalability. Here, an approach that combines the best of the two worlds by transforming assemblies of single&#8208;crystal gold nanocube building blocks into continuous monocrystalline plasmonic nanostructures with an arbitrary shape, via epitaxy in solution at near ambient temperature, is introduced. Nanocube dimers are used as a nanoreactor model system to investigate the mechanism in operando, revealing competitive redox processes of oxidative etching at the nanocube corners and simultaneous heterogeneous nucleation at their surface, that ensure filling of the sub&#8208;nanometer gap in a self&#8208;limited manner. Applying this procedure to nanocube arrays assembled in a patterned poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) substrate, it is able to obtain printable monocrystalline nanoantenna arrays that can be swiftly integrated in devices. This may lead to the implementation of low&#8208;cost nanophotonic surfaces of the highest quality in industrial&#160;products.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Artificial Nanocilia Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy is presented that can direct magnetic nanoparticles (NPs) into a highly ordered responsive artificial nanocilia actuator with exquisite nanometer 3D structural arrangements. The assembled nanocilia can exhibit field&#8208;responsive actuation motions in a reversible and repeatable manner via rolling and sliding between assembled NPs with the aid of oleic acid bearings tethered to each NP.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) is a powerful route to constructing higher&#8208;order structures. However, the programmed self&#8208;assembly of NPs into non&#8208;close&#8208;packed, 3D, shape&#8208;morphing nanocilia arrays remains elusive, whereas dynamically actuated nanometer cilia are universal in living systems. Here, a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy is presented that can direct magnetic NPs into a highly ordered responsive artificial nanocilia actuator with exquisite nanometer 3D structural arrangements. The self&#8208;assembled artificial NP cilia can maintain their structural integrity through the interplay of interparticle interactions. Interestingly, the nanocilia can exhibit a field&#8208;responsive actuation motion through &#8220;rolling and sliding&#8221; between assembled NPs rather than bending the entire ciliary beam. It is demonstrated that oleic acid coated over the NPs acts as a lubricating bearing and enables the rolling/sliding&#8208;based actuation of the cilia.

         <title>Ultrafast Thermalization Pathways of Excited Bulk and Surface States in the Ferroelectric Rashba Semiconductor GeTe</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A time&#8208;, spin&#8208;, and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission study of the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor &#945;&#8208;GeTe is performed following ultrafast optical excitation. The thermalization pathways exhibit an unconventional temperature dependence, which is understood in terms of the underpinning microscopic scattering channels. The Rashba effect is found to inhibit electron&#8211;electron scatterings, enabling control of the overall dynamics with lattice temperature on subpicosecond timescales.








Abstract
A large Rashba effect is essential for future applications in spintronics. Particularly attractive is understanding and controlling nonequilibrium properties of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors. Here, time&#8208; and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission is utilized to access the ultrafast dynamics of bulk and surface transient Rashba states after femtosecond optical excitation of GeTe. A complex thermalization pathway is observed, wherein three different timescales can be clearly distinguished: intraband thermalization, interband equilibration, and electronic cooling. These dynamics exhibit an unconventional temperature dependence: while the cooling phase speeds up with increasing sample temperature, the opposite happens for interband thermalization. It is demonstrated how, due to the Rashba effect, an interdependence of these timescales on the relative strength of both electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;phonon interactions is responsible for the counterintuitive temperature dependence, with spin&#8208;selection constrained interband electron&#8211;electron scatterings found both to dominate dynamics away from the Fermi level, and to weaken with increasing temperature. These findings are supported by theoretical calculations within the Boltzmann approach explicitly showing the opposite behavior of all relevant electron&#8211;electron and electron&#8211;phonon scattering channels with temperature, thus confirming the microscopic mechanism of the experimental findings. The present results are important for future applications of ferroelectric Rashba semiconductors and their excitations in ultrafast spintronics.

         <title>A Renally Clearable Activatable Polymeric Nanoprobe for Early Detection of Hepatic Ischemia&#8208;Reperfusion Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An activatable polymeric nanoprobe that possesses superoxide&#8208;anion&#8208;triggered renal clearance and near&#8208;infrared fluorescence response is developed. The nanoprobe efficiently accumulates in the liver, and sensitively reacts with upregulated superoxide anions to undergo in situ depolymerization, and effectively releases a fluorescent artificial urinary biomarker for real&#8208;time imaging and urinalysis of hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury at the early stage.








Abstract
Although hepatic ischemia&#8208;reperfusion injury (IRI) represents a major complication in many clinical settings, it remains a diagnostic dilemma due to its reliance on insensitive assays or invasive biopsy. The development of an activatable polymeric nanoprobe (APNSO) for real&#8208;time in vivo near&#8208;infrared fluorescence (NIRF) imaging and urinalysis of hepatic IRI is reported here. APNSO has a backbone comprising renally clearable fluorophore fragments and self&#8208;immolative structural units. In the presence of an oxidative stress biomarker (superoxide anion, O2&#8226;&#8722;) during hepatic IRI, APNSO can be fluorescently activated for in vivo NIRF imaging and depolymerized to release renally clearable fluorophores for urinalysis. By virtue of its high hepatic accumulation, sensitive response toward O2&#8226;&#8722;, and effective release of renally clearable fluorophores, APNSO&#8208;based imaging and urinalysis detect hepatic IRI at least 7 h earlier than typical clinical assays in a mouse model. This study not only provides new opportunities for noninvasive diagnosis of hepatic IRI, but also reveals guidelines for the development of optical nanosensors for early urinalysis.

         <title>Long&#8208;Cycling Sulfide&#8208;Based All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrochemo&#8208;Mechanically Stable Electrodes</title>

         <dc:description>
Aiming at fabricating high&#8208;performance all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASLBs), this work reports a silicon composite anode that demonstrates high capacity and better electrochemo&#8208;mechanical stability than Li&#8208;metal anodes. Meanwhile, interface&#8208;stabilized single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 is utilized as the cathode. The ASLB delivers a cell&#8208;level energy density of 285 mAh g&#8722;1 and long cycling life of 1000 cycles.








Abstract
The anode plays a critical role relating to the energy density in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (ASLBs). Silicon (Si) and lithium (Li) metal are two of the most attractive anodes because of their ultrahigh theoretical capacities. However, most investigations focus on Li metal, leaving the great potential of Si underrated. This work investigates the stability, processability, and cost of Si anodes in ASLBs and compares them with Li metal. Moreover, single&#8208;crystal LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 is stabilized with lithium silicate (Li2SiOx) through a scalable sol&#8211;gel method. ASLBs with a cell&#8208;level energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 are obtained by sandwiching the Si anode, the thin sulfide solid&#8208;state electrolyte membrane, and the interface stabilized LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2. The full cell delivers a high capacity of 145 mAh g&#8722;1 at C/3 and maintains stability for 1000&#160;cycles. This work inspires commercialization of ASLBs on a large scale with exciting manufacturing lines for large&#8208;scale, safe, and economical energy storage.

The ASLB delivers a cell-level energy density of 285 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and long cycling life of 1000 cycles.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anode plays a critical role relating to the energy density in all-solid-state lithium batteries (ASLBs). Silicon (Si) and lithium (Li) metal are two of the most attractive anodes because of their ultrahigh theoretical capacities. However, most investigations focus on Li metal, leaving the great potential of Si underrated. This work investigates the stability, processability, and cost of Si anodes in ASLBs and compares them with Li metal. Moreover, single-crystal LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is stabilized with lithium silicate (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;) through a scalable sol&#8211;gel method. ASLBs with a cell-level energy density of 285&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; are obtained by sandwiching the Si anode, the thin sulfide solid-state electrolyte membrane, and the interface stabilized LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.8&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.1&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The full cell delivers a high capacity of 145 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at C/3 and maintains stability for 1000&#160;cycles. This work inspires commercialization of ASLBs on a large scale with exciting manufacturing lines for large-scale, safe, and economical energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>SEEDING to Enable Sensitive Electrochemical Detection of Biomarkers in Undiluted Biological Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nanostructured surface with nanoporous substrate provides high sensitivity and a low detection limit with antifouling capabilities. This material enables the fabrication of electrochemical biosensors for the detection of biomarkers in undiluted complex biological samples without suffering passivation. Direct analysis of clinical plasma samples reveal that it is sensitive enough to discriminate between a prostate cancer cohort and healthy donors.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors have shown great potential for simple, fast, and cost&#8208;effective point&#8208;of&#8208;care diagnostic tools. However, direct analysis of complex biological fluids such as plasma has been limited by the loss of sensitivity caused by biofouling. By increasing the surface area, the nanostructured electrode can improve detection sensitivity. However, like a double&#8208;edged sword, a large surface area increases the nonspecific adsorption of contaminating proteins. The use of nanoporous structures may prevent fouling proteins. However, there is no straightforward approach for creating nanostructured and nanoporous surfaces compatible with microfabricated thin&#8208;film electrodes. Herein, the preferential etching of chloride and surfactant&#8208;assisted anisotropic gold reduction to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes is demonstrated, yielding a 190&#160;&#177;&#160;20&#160;times larger surface area within a minute without using templates. This process, &#8220;surfactant&#8208;based electrochemical etch&#8208;deposit interplay for nanostructure/nanopore growth&#8221; (SEEDING), on electrodes enhances the sensitivity and antibiofouling capabilities of amperometric biosensors, enabling direct analysis of tumor&#8208;derived extracellular vesicles (tEVs) in complex biofluids with a limit of detection of 300&#160;tEVs&#160;&#181;L&#8722;1&#160;from undiluted plasma and good discrimination between patients with prostate cancer from healthy ones with an area under the curve of 0.91&#160;in urine and 0.90&#160;in plasma samples.

         <title>Quasi&#8208;1D van der Waals Antiferromagnetic CrZr4Te14 with Large In&#8208;Plane Anisotropic Negative Magnetoresistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layered CrZr4Te14 is constructed of [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis. The intrachain magnetic coupling of the [CrTe2] chain is ferromagnetic, while the opposite magnetic ordering between the chains makes CrZr4Te14 an antiferromagnet. Moreover, CrZr4Te14 shows large intrinsic negative magnetoresistence of &#8722;56%, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor reaches 8.2 owing to the ferromagnetic [CrTe2] chains.








Abstract
The discovery of 2D van der Waals (vdW) magnetic materials is of great significance to explore intriguing 2D magnetic physics and develop innovative spintronic devices. In this work, a new quasi&#8208;1D vdW layered compound CrZr4Te14 is successfully synthesized. Owing to the existence of 1D [CrTe2] and [ZrTe3] chains along the b&#8208;axis, CrZr4Te14 crystals show strong anisotropy of phonon vibrations, electrical transport, and magnetism. Density functional theory calculations reveal the ferromagnetic (FM) coupling within the [CrTe2] chain, while the interchain and interlayer couplings are both weakly antiferromagnetic (AF). Notably, a large intrinsic negative magnetoresistance (nMR) of &#8722;56% is achieved at 2 K under 9 T, and the in&#8208;plane anisotropic factor of nMR can reach up to 8.2 in the CrZr4Te14 device. The 1D FM chains and anisotropic nMR effect make CrZr4Te14 an interesting platform for exploring novel polarization&#8208;sensitive spintronics.

         <title>Tunable Domain Switching Features of Incommensurate Antiferroelectric Ceramics Realizing Excellent Energy Storage Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cd2+ substitution modulates the incommensurate period of the La3+&#8208;modified antiferroelectric matrix in next&#8208;generation dielectric ceramics and thereby adjusts the depolarization response of the induced relaxor ferroelectric phase. The energy storage properties (&#8776;19.3 J cm&#8722;3, &#8776;91%) are both competitive enough as compared to other dielectric ceramics. The actual discharge process releases a giant energy density of &#8776;15.4 J cm&#8722;3.








Abstract
An incommensurate modulated antiferroelectric phase is a key part of ideal candidate materials for the next generation of dielectric ceramics with excellent energy storage properties. However, there is less research carried out when considering its relatively low polarization response. Here, the incommensurate phase is modulated by stabilizing the antiferroelectric phase and the energy storage performance of the incommensurate phase under ultrahigh electric field is studied. The tape&#8208;casting method is applied to construct dense and thin ceramics. La3+ doping induces a room&#8208;temperature incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic matrix. With little Cd2+, the extremely superior energy storage performances arose as follows: when 0.03, the recoverable energy storage density reaches &#8776;19.3 J cm&#8208;3, accompanying an ultrahigh energy storage efficiency of &#8776;91% (870&#160;kV cm&#8208;1); also, a giant discharge energy density of &#8776;15.4 J cm&#8208;3 emerges during actual operation. In situ observations demonstrate that these superior energy storage properties originate from the phase transition from the incommensurate antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase to the induced rhombohedral relaxor ferroelectric one. The adjustable incommensurate period affects the depolarization response. The revealed phase&#8208;transition mechanism enriches the existing antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. Attention to the incommensurate phase can provide a reference for the selection of the next generation of high&#8208;performance antiferroelectric materials.

         <title>A Gapped Phase in Semimetallic Td&#8208;WTe2 Induced by Lithium Intercalation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A gapped phase in Weyl semimetal Td&#8208;WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation is reported. The new phase features an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature from in situ transport measurements and is identified as a charge density wave (CDW) state with a bandgap of 0.14 eV by theoretical calculations. The findings thus provide the first experimental evidence of CDW in Td&#8208;WTe2.








Abstract
The Weyl semimetal WTe2 has shown several correlated electronic behaviors, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and a possible exciton insulator state, all of which can be tuned by various physical and chemical approaches. Here, a new electronic phase in WTe2 induced by lithium intercalation is discovered. The new phase exhibits an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature and its carrier density is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the carrier density of the semimetallic Td phase, probed by in situ Hall measurements as a function of lithium intercalation. The theoretical calculations predict the new lithiated phase to be a potential charge density wave (CDW) phase with a bandgap of &#8776;0.14&#160;eV, in good agreement with the in situ transport data. The new phase is structurally distinct from the initial Td phase, characterized by polarization&#8208;angle&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy, and large lattice distortions close to 6% are predicted in the new phase. This finding of a new gapped phase in a 2D semimetal demonstrates electrochemical intercalation as a powerful tuning knob for modulating electron density and phase stability in 2D materials.

&lt;p&gt;A gapped phase in Weyl semimetal T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced by lithium intercalation is reported. The new phase features an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature from in situ transport measurements and is identified as a charge density wave (CDW) state with a bandgap of 0.14 eV by theoretical calculations. The findings thus provide the first experimental evidence of CDW in T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;-WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Weyl semimetal WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has shown several correlated electronic behaviors, such as the quantum spin Hall effect, superconductivity, ferroelectricity, and a possible exciton insulator state, all of which can be tuned by various physical and chemical approaches. Here, a new electronic phase in WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; induced by lithium intercalation is discovered. The new phase exhibits an increasing resistivity with decreasing temperature and its carrier density is almost two orders of magnitude lower than the carrier density of the semimetallic T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; phase, probed by in situ Hall measurements as a function of lithium intercalation. The theoretical calculations predict the new lithiated phase to be a potential charge density wave (CDW) phase with a bandgap of &#8776;0.14&#160;eV, in good agreement with the in situ transport data. The new phase is structurally distinct from the initial T&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; phase, characterized by polarization-angle-dependent Raman spectroscopy, and large lattice distortions close to 6% are predicted in the new phase. This finding of a new gapped phase in a 2D semimetal demonstrates electrochemical intercalation as a powerful tuning knob for modulating electron density and phase stability in 2D materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Deep&#8208;Learning&#8208;Assisted Stratification of Amyloid Beta Mutants Using Drying Droplet Patterns</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Deep&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted stratification of amyloid beta mutants using drying droplet patterns is reported. A process as simple and scalable as allowing a peptide droplet to dry onto a surface can disclose critical structural mismatches of amyloid beta peptides. When analyzed with pretrained neuronal networks, the peptide deposits predict single amino acid mismatches and conformational misfolding with 99% accuracy.








Abstract
The development of simple and accurate methods to predict mutations in proteins remains an unsolved challenge in modern biochemistry. It is discovered that critical information about primary and secondary peptide structures can be inferred from the stains left behind by their drying droplets. To analyze the complex stain patterns, deep&#8208;learning neuronal networks are challenged with polarized light microscopy images derived from the drying droplet deposits of a range of amyloid beta (1&#8211;42) (A&#946;42) peptides. These peptides differ in a single amino acid residue and represent hereditary mutants of Alzheimer's disease. Stain patterns are not only reproducible but also result in comprehensive stratification of eight amyloid beta (A&#946;) variants with predictive accuracies above 99%. Similarly, peptide stains of a range of distinct A&#946;42 peptide conformations are identified with accuracies above 99%. The results suggest that a method as simple as drying a droplet of a peptide solution onto a solid surface may serve as an indicator of minute, yet structurally meaningful differences in peptides&#8217; primary and secondary structures. Scalable and accurate detection schemes for stratification of conformational and structural protein alterations are critically needed to unravel pathological signatures in many human diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

         <title>Optimal Physicochemical Properties of Antibody&#8211;Nanoparticle Conjugates for Improved Tumor Targeting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tumor&#8208;targeted nanoparticles represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. This meta&#8208;analysis describes the biodistribution and pharmacokinetic profiles of antibody&#8208;/fragment&#8208;targeted nanoparticles. The impact of the physicochemical properties of the nanoparticles and the optimal conjugation strategy to optimize the tumor targeting efficiencies is discussed.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;targeted antibody (mAb)/fragment&#8208;conjugated nanoparticles (NPs) represent an innovative strategy for improving the local delivery of small molecules. However, the physicochemical properties of full mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8211;NPs&#8212;that is, NP material, size, charge, as well as the targeting antibody moiety, and the linker conjugation strategies&#8212;remain to be optimized to achieve an efficient tumor targeting. A meta&#8208;analysis of 161 peer&#8208;reviewed studies is presented, which describes the use of tumor&#8208;targeted mAb&#8211;NPs and fragment&#8722;NPs from 2009 to 2021. The use of these targeted NPs is confirmed to result in significantly greater tumor uptake of NPs than that of naked NPs (7.9 &#177; 1.9% ID g&#8722;1 versus 3.2 &#177; 0.6% ID g&#8722;1, respectively). The study further demonstrates that for lipidic NPs, fragment&#8211;NPs provide a significantly higher tumor uptake than full mAb&#8211;NPs. In parallel, for both polymeric and organic/inorganic NPs, full mAb&#8211;NPs yield a significant higher tumor uptake than fragment&#8211;NPs. In addition, for both lipidic and polymeric NPs, the tumor uptake is improved with the smallest sizes of the conjugates. Finally, the pharmacokinetics of the conjugates are demonstrated to be driven by the NPs and not by the antibody moieties, independently of using full mAb&#8211;NPs or fragment&#8211;NPs, confirming the importance of optimizing the NP design to improve the tumor uptake.

         <title>Chemical Potential Switching of the Anomalous Hall Effect in an Ultrathin Noncollinear Antiferromagnetic Metal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals are hot spots in the magnetic community. The chemical potential is found to effectively switch on/off the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of such metals, which opens a new path to tuning the AHE and experimentally validates the essential role of chemical potential in theoretical calculations for determining the anomalous Hall conductivity.








Abstract
The discovery of the anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear antiferromagnetic metals represents one of the most important breakthroughs for the emergent antiferromagnetic spintronics. The tuning of chemical potential has been an important theoretical approach to varying the anomalous Hall conductivity, but the direct experimental demonstration has been challenging owing to the large carrier density of metals. In this work, an ultrathin noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn3Ge film is fabricated and its carrier density is modulated by ionic liquid gating. Via a small voltage of &#8776;3&#160;V, its carrier density is altered by &#8776;90% and, accordingly, the anomalous Hall effect is completely switched off. This work thus creates an attractive new way to steering the anomalous Hall effect in noncollinear antiferromagnets.

         <title>Origin of the 2D Electron Gas at the SrTiO3 Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D electron gas at the surface of SrTiO3 (001) can be turned on and off by depositing either SrO or TiO2, which is observed by a combination of oxide molecular beam epitaxy with in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray scattering and angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. Either way, the surface remains TiO2&#8208;terminated.








Abstract
Bulk SrTiO3 is a well&#8208;known band insulator and the most common substrate used in the field of complex oxide heterostructures. Its surface and interface with other oxides, however, have demonstrated a variety of remarkable behaviors distinct from those expected. In this work, using a suite of in situ techniques to monitor both the atomic and electronic structures of the SrTiO3 (001) surface prior to and during growth, the disappearance and re&#8208;appearance of a 2D electron gas (2DEG) is observed after the completion of each SrO and TiO2 monolayer, respectively. The 2DEG is identified with the TiO2 double layer present at the initial SrTiO3 surface, which gives rise to a surface potential and mobile electrons due to vacancies within the TiO2&#8722;x adlayer. Much like the electronic reconstruction discovered in other systems, two atomic planes are required, here supplied by the double layer. The combined in situ scattering/spectroscopy findings resolve a number of longstanding issues associated with complex oxide interfaces, facilitating the employment of atomic&#8208;scale defect engineering in oxide&#160;electronics.

         <title>A Ceramic&#8208;Electrolyte Glucose Fuel Cell for Implantable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A ceramic&#8208;electrolyte glucose fuel cell as a power source for implantable biomedical devices is introduced and demonstrated. The highly miniaturized device with a thickness below 400&#160;nm exhibits a peak power density of 43 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, is fully integrated into silicon, and consists of only ceramic and noble&#8208;metal materials for easy sterilization.








Abstract
Next&#8208;generation implantable devices such as sensors, drug&#8208;delivery systems, and electroceuticals require efficient, reliable, and highly miniaturized power sources. Existing power sources such as the Li&#8211;I2 pacemaker battery exhibit limited scale&#8208;down potential without sacrificing capacity, and therefore, alternatives are needed to power miniaturized implants. This work shows that ceramic electrolytes can be used in potentially implantable glucose fuel cells with unprecedented miniaturization. Specifically, a ceramic glucose fuel cell&#8212;based on the proton&#8208;conducting electrolyte ceria&#8212;that is composed of a freestanding membrane of thickness below 400&#160;nm and fully integrated into silicon for easy integration into bioelectronics is demonstrated. In contrast to polymeric membranes, all materials used are highly temperature stable, making thermal sterilization for implantation trivial. A peak power density of 43 &#181;W cm&#8722;2, and an unusually high statistical verification of successful fabrication and electrochemical function across 150 devices for open&#8208;circuit voltage and 12 devices for power density, enabled by a specifically designed testing apparatus and protocol, is demonstrated. The findings demonstrate that ceramic&#8208;based micro&#8208;glucose&#8208;fuel&#8208;cells constitute the smallest potentially implantable power sources to date and are viable options to power the next generation of highly miniaturized implantable medical devices.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;Tuned Full&#8208;Color Emission: Uncommon Luminescence Change from Polymer Free&#8208;Volume Variations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In sharp contrast to conventional rigidochromic probes, a new type of anti&#8208;rigidochromic probe that redshifts its emission upon polymer matrix rigidification is developed. This rigidity&#8208;tuned full&#8208;color emission enables noninvasively detect polymerization kinetics, in situ optically reporting of polymer degradations, and an unprecedented polymer free&#8208;volume&#8208;based data&#8208;encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting method with a high security level.








Abstract
Probing the rigidity change of microenvironments via tracking embedded molecular fluorophore emissions represents a robust approach to monitor various polymer microstructural evolutions and biomolecular events with a high spatiotemporal resolution. However, reported fluorophores exclusively blueshift their emissions (termed as &#8220;rigidochromism&#8221;) or merely alter intensities upon rigidification, suffering from inferior sensitivities, low&#8208;contrast outputs, and attenuated biocompatibilities. Here, phenanthridine&#8208;fused triazatruxene fluorophores (PTFs) with pronounced bathochromic emission (up to 135&#160;nm) toward rigidifying media at a low loading of 5&#160;ppm without sacrificing the quantum yields and lifetime are developed. PTFs effectively interact with polymeric matrixes through polar&#8211;&#960; interactions and form charge&#8208;transfer complexes, resulting to a remarkable fluorescent color change from blue to red&#8208;orange over matrix rigidifying. Such a unique anti&#8208;rigidochromism enables a highly sensitive rigidity detection (i.e., a subtle polymer molecular&#8208;weight change (as low as 1000&#160;Da vs up to 10&#160;kDa for conventional probes) can result to obvious emission color changes). PTFs are able to noninvasively detect polymerization kinetics and in situ optically report polymer degradations. The broadly (nearly full&#8208;spectrum) tunable emission and the efficient coupling between anti&#8208;rigidochromism and polymer hierarchical structures/topologies render fluorescence with controlled wavelength and chirality, leading to an unprecedented free&#8208;volume&#8208;based data encryption and anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology with a superhigh security level.

         <title>Photoenergy Harvesting by Photoacid Solution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new way of harvesting solar energy is demonstrated by using a photoacid solution that generates a Nernst potential and capacitive current upon asymmetric light exposure. Such transparent liquid&#8208;state devices enable form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design and vertical stacking that maximizes spatial and light&#8208;use efficiencies.








Abstract
Solar energy has seen 180&#160;years of development since the discovery of the photovoltaic effect, having achieved the most successful commercialization in the energy&#8208;harvesting fields. Despite its long history, even the most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photovoltaics remain confined to solid&#8208;state devices, limiting spatial and light utilization efficiencies. Herein, a liquid&#8208;state photoenergy harvester based on a photoacid (PA), a chemical that releases protons upon light irradiation and recombines with them in the dark through a fully reversible reaction, is demonstrated. Asymmetric light exposure on a PA solution contained in a transparent tube generates a pH gradient (&#916;pH&#160;=&#160;2) along the exposed and dark regions, which charges the Nernst potential up to 0.7&#160;V across the two electrodes embedded at each end, as if a capacitor. Owing to the reversibility of PAs, a PA&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;state photoenergy harvester (PLPH) generates capacitive currents up to 0.72&#160;mA&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;on an irradiation. Notably, the transparent nature of the PLPH enables vertical stacking up to 25&#160;units, which multiplies the light&#8208;harvesting efficiencies by over 1000%. This unique approach provides a new route to harness solar energy with a form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design that maximizes spatial and light&#8208;use efficiencies.

         <title>A Polyvalent Peptide CD40 Nanoagonist for Targeted Modulation of Dendritic Cells and Amplified Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superstructural nanoagonist (PVA&#8208;CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure is constructed through click reaction directed in vivo self&#8208;assembly. PVA&#8208;CD40 is able to drain and retain in lymph node to induce sustained dendritic cells maturation through CD40 signaling and further leads to durable CD8+ T cell output for tumor regression and rejunction of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Targeted immunomodulation through biomolecule&#8208;based nanostructures, especially to dendritic cells (DCs), holds great promise for effective cancer therapy. However, construction of high&#8208;performance agonist by mimicking natural ligand to activate immune cell signaling is a great challenge so far. Here, a peptide&#8208;based nanoagonist toward CD40 (PVA&#8208;CD40) with preorganized interfacial topological structure that activates lymph node DCs efficiently and persistently, achieving amplified immune therapeutic efficacy is described. The on&#8208;site fabrication of PVA&#8208;CD40 is realized through the click conjugation of two functional peptides including the &#8220;CD40 anchoring arm&#8221; and the &#8220;assembly&#8208;driving motor.&#8221; The resultant polyvalent interface rapidly triggers the receptor oligomerization and downstream signaling. Strikingly, one shot administration of PVA&#8208;CD40 elicits maturation period of DCs up to 2.3&#8208;fold comparing to that of CD40 antibody. Finally, combining the PVA&#8208;CD40 with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 antibody results in subsequent inhibition of tumor growth in both B16F10 and 4T1 mice tumor models with survival rate up to 37%, while none of the mice survives in the clinically relevant CD40 mAb and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1 combination&#8208;treated group. It is envisioned that the fabrication of antibody&#8208;like superstructures in vivo provides an efficient platform for modulating the duration of immune response to achieve optimal therapeutic efficacy.

         <title>Hidden Local Symmetry Breaking in Silver Diamondoid Compounds is Root Cause of Ultralow Thermal Conductivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms leads to the local symmetry breaking in Ag&#8208;based diamondoid compounds. This emphanitic local geometric distortion of Ag causes a global distortion of the crystal structure and results in the ultralow thermal conductivity. Based on this, the heat conductivity of the diamondoid structure can be directly evaluated by the crystallographic distortion parameter.








Abstract
Typically, conventional structure transitions occur from a low symmetry state to a higher symmetry state upon warming. In this work, an unexpected local symmetry breaking in the tetragonal diamondoid compound AgGaTe2 is reported, which, upon warming, evolves continuously from an undistorted ground state to a locally distorted state while retaining average crystallographic symmetry. This is a rare phenomenon previously referred to as emphanisis. This distorted state, caused by the weak sd3 orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms, causes their displacement off the tetrahedron center and promotes a global distortion of the crystal structure resulting in strong acoustic&#8211;optical phonon scattering and an ultralow lattice thermal conductivity of 0.26 W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at 850 K in AgGaTe2. The findings explain the underlying reason for the unexpectedly low thermal conductivities of silver&#8208;based compounds compared to copper&#8208;based analogs and provide a guideline to suppressing heat transport in diamondoid and other materials.

&lt;p&gt;Weak sd&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital hybridization of tetrahedral Ag atoms leads to the local symmetry breaking in Ag-based diamondoid compounds. This emphanitic local geometric distortion of Ag causes a global distortion of the crystal structure and results in the ultralow thermal conductivity. Based on this, the heat conductivity of the diamondoid structure can be directly evaluated by the crystallographic distortion parameter.

&lt;/p&gt;

Cyano functionalization of thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene donor unit in n&#8208;type polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN leads to simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property compared to its non&#8208;cyanated analogue, subsequently enabling a record&#8208;high &#956;e,OECT of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type OECTs.








Abstract
n&#8208;Type organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors (OMIECs) with high electron mobility are scarce and highly challenging to develop. As a result, the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) of n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) lags far behind the p&#8208;type analogs, restraining the development of OECT&#8208;based low&#8208;power complementary circuits and biosensors. Here, two n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor (D&#8211;A) polymers based on fused bithiophene imide dimer f&#8208;BTI2 as the acceptor unit and thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit are reported. The cyanation of TVT enables polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN with simultaneously enhanced ion&#8208;uptake ability, film structural order, and charge&#8208;transport property. As a result, it is able to obtain a high volumetric capacitance (C*) of 170&#160;&#177;&#160;22&#160;F cm&#8722;3 and a record OECT electron mobility (&#956;e,OECT) of 0.24 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 for f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCN, subsequently achieving a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#181;C* of 41.3 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and geometry&#8208;normalized transconductance (gm,norm) of 12.8 S cm&#8722;1 in n&#8208;type accumulation&#8208;mode OECTs. In contrast, only a moderate &#181;C* of 1.50 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 is measured for the non&#8208;cyanated polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. These remarkable results demonstrate the great power of cyano functionalization of polymer semiconductors in developing n&#8208;type OMIECs with substantial electron mobility in aqueous environment for high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type OECTs.

         <title>MOF&#8211;COF &#8220;Alloy&#8221; Membranes for Efficient Propylene/Propane Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8211;covalent organic framework (COF) &#8220;alloy&#8221; membrane (AM) is fabricated, which exhibits a record&#8208;high propylene/propane separation performance with a selectivity of more than 200 and a propylene permeance of 168 GPU, owing to the fine&#8208;tuned lattice rigidity of the MOF lattice, enabled by a facile, generic alloying strategy.








Abstract
Molecular&#8208;sieving membranes from metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising candidates for separating olefin/paraffin mixtures, a critical demand in sustainable chemical processes and a grand challenge in molecular separation. Currently, the inherent lattice flexibility of MOFs severely compromises their precise sieving ability. Here, a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept of &#8220;alloy&#8221; membranes (AMs), which are fabricated by incorporating quaternary ammonium (QA)&#8208;functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) into a zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) matrix is demonstrated. The Coulomb force between the COFs and the ZIF&#8208;8 restricts the linker rotation of the ZIF&#8208;8, generating a distinct alloying effect, by which the lattice rigidity of ZIF&#8208;8 can be conveniently tuned through varying the content of the COFs, similar to the flexible&#8208;to&#8208;rigid transition in aluminum alloy manufacturing. Such an alloying effect confers the AM's superior propylene/propane separation performance, with a propylene/propane separation factor surpassing 200 and a propylene permeance of 168 GPU. Hopefully, the AMs concept and the concomitant alloying effect can update the connotation of mixed matrix membranes and stimulate the re&#8208;envisioning about the design paradigm and development of advanced membranes for energy&#8208;efficient separations.

A novel plasmonic trienzyme&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic framework (plasEnMOF) nanoplatform that integrates starvation, chemodynamic, and near&#8208;infrared II plasmonic photothermal trimodal therapy for anticancer treatment is reported. The photothermal&#8208;effect&#8208;enhanced catalytic activity and excellent protective capacity of the natural enzyme activities are demonstrated in the present plasEnMOFs against extreme environments such as external chemical agents and high temperature.








Abstract
Natural enzyme&#8208;based catalytic cascades hold great promise for cancer therapy, but their clinical utility is greatly hindered by the loss of their functions during in vivo delivery. Herein, a plasmonic trienzyme&#8208;integrated metal&#8211;organic framework (plasEnMOF) nanoplatform with high&#8208;efficiency enzyme cascades is reported for synergistic starvation, chemodynamic, and plasmonic hyperthermia trimodal therapy of hypoxic tumors. These plasEnMOFs are created with encapsulation of near&#8208;infrared&#8208;II (NIR&#8208;II) plasmonic Au nanorods and natural enzymes&#8212;catalase (CAT), glucose oxidase (GOx), and horseradish peroxidase (HRP) within zeolitic imidazolate framework&#8208;8 (ZIF&#8208;8) MOFs. As a trienzyme cascade system, the plasEnMOFs effectively deplete intratumoral glucose and generate toxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) for starvation therapy and chemodynamic therapy (CDT) combined with the plasmonic hyperthermia therapy (PHT). The enhanced glucose consumption and ROS generation by the NIR&#8208;II plasmonic photothermal effect are also demonstrated. The improved chemo&#8208; and thermotolerance of the encapsulated natural enzymes within the protective ZIF&#8208;8 MOFs are evidenced. With the integrated enzyme cascades and NIR&#8208;II photothermal effects, these plasEnMOFs are demonstrated with exceptional therapeutic effects on 4T1 xenograft tumors through the combined starvation/CDT/PHT therapy. This work highlights the superiority of natural enzyme cascade systems integrated in plasmonic MOFs for high&#8208;efficiency enzymatic cancer therapy.

Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is synthesized and incorporated into the SnO2/perovskite interface to modulate its electronic properties. Experimental results and theoretical calculations demonstrate a bridge function of HADI. The HADI&#8208;SnO2&#8208;based rigid/flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve efficiencies of 24.79% and 22.44%, respectively, the highest reported values for rigid MA&#8208;free PSCs and flexible PSCs so far.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells (f&#8208;PSCs) have attracted great attention because of their unique advantages in lightweight and portable electronics applications. However, their efficiencies are far inferior to those of their rigid counterparts. Herein, a novel histamine diiodate (HADI) is designed based on theoretical study to modify the SnO2/perovskite interface. Systematic experimental results reveal that the HADI serves effectively as a multifunctional agent mainly in three aspects: 1) surface modification to realign the SnO2 conduction band upward to improve interfacial charge extraction; 2) passivating the buried perovskite surface, and 3) bridging between the SnO2 and perovskite layers for effective charge transfer. Consequently, the rigid MA&#8208;free PSCs based on the HADI&#8208;SnO2 electron transport layer (ETL) display not only a high champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.79% and open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.20&#160;V but also outstanding stability as demonstrated by the PSCs preserving 91% of their initial efficiencies after being exposed to ambient atmosphere for 1200 h without any encapsulation. Furthermore, the solution&#8208;processed HADI&#8208;SnO2 ETL formed at low temperature (100&#160;&#176;C) is utilized in f&#8208;PSCs that achieve a PCE as high as 22.44%, the highest reported PCE for f&#8208;PSCs to date.

Rayleigh&#8208;instability&#8208;induced spindle&#8208;knot fibers are knitted for the fabrication of permeable and moisture&#8208;proof textile triboelectric sensors. With the assistance of deep learning, the on&#8208;mask sensor network can realize the respiration pattern recognition with a classification accuracy up to 100%. A customized cellphone application is developed to enable real&#8208;time, user&#8208;friendly, and personalized respiration management.








Abstract
Wearable respiratory monitoring is a fast, non&#8208;invasive, and convenient approach to provide early recognition of human health abnormalities like restrictive and obstructive lung diseases. Here, a computational fluid dynamics assisted on&#8208;mask sensor network is reported, which can overcome different user facial contours and environmental interferences to collect highly accurate respiratory signals. Inspired by cribellate silk, Rayleigh&#8208;instability&#8208;induced spindle&#8208;knot fibers are knitted for the fabrication of permeable and moisture&#8208;proof textile triboelectric sensors that hold a decent signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio of 51.2&#160;dB, a response time of 0.28 s, and a sensitivity of 0.46&#160;V kPa&#8722;1. With the assistance of deep learning, the on&#8208;mask sensor network can realize the respiration pattern recognition with a classification accuracy up to 100%, showing great improvement over a single respiratory sensor. Additionally, a customized user&#8208;friendly cellphone application is developed to connect the processed respiratory signals for real&#8208;time data&#8208;driven diagnosis and one&#8208;click health data sharing with the clinicians. The deep&#8208;learning&#8208;assisted on&#8208;mask sensor network opens a new avenue for personalized respiration management in the era of the Internet of Things.

Nanocilia
In article number 2200185, Hoon Eui Jeong and co&#8208;workers develop a programmable self&#8208;assembly strategy that can direct magnetic nanoparticles into a highly ordered, field&#8208;responsive, artificial nanocilia array. The self&#8208;assembled nanocilia can maintain their structural integrity through the interplay of interparticle interactions. Interestingly, the nanocilia can exhibit a responsive actuation motion through &#8220;rolling and sliding&#8221; between assembled nanoparticles.

Photoenergy Harvesting
In article number 2201734, Il&#8208;Doo Kim and co&#8208;workers develop a photoacid&#8208;driven liquid&#8208;state photoenergy harvester (PLPH) as the first demonstration of a photoacid&#8208;solution&#8208;based device that generates electric energy from light. Asymmetric light exposure on the PLPH generates electric energy by the light&#8208;induced pH gradient (&#916;pH = 2) along the two electrodes This unique approach offers a new way to harness solar energy in a form&#8208;factor&#8208;free design that maximizes space and light&#8208;use efficiency.

Artificial Neurons
An artificial tactile neuron based on an ovonic threshold switch and a piezoresistive sensor reported by Suyoun Lee, Hyunjung Yi, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201608 can encode the elastic stiffness of pressed materials into spike&#8208;frequency evolution patterns. The spiking representation of stiffness in combination with spiking&#8208;neural&#8208;network&#8208;based learning can be used to classify the malignant status of breast tumors with low energy consumption, low latency, and yet high accuracy.

Drying Droplets
Critical information about primary and secondary peptide structures can be inferred from the stains left behind by their drying droplets. In article number 2110404, J&#246;rg Lahann and Azam Jeihanipour establish a simple and scalable platform to analyze the deposition patterns obtained from drying droplets (here: amyloid beta peptides), which are information&#8208;rich, complex, and characteristic; just as fingerprint patterns are unique identifiers for humans. The cover image shows an artistic rendering of a polarized light microscopy image, depicting the drying pattern of an amyloid beta peptide.

Electrochemical Pollination
In article number 2200981, Yoon&#8208;Kyoung Cho and co&#8208;workers discuss electrochemical roughening, a method based on the etching and redeposition of material from a flat surface, to create homogeneous, nanostructured, and nanoporous gold electrodes. The process is not efficient, as most of the etched material typically diffuses away. However, the addition of surfactant generates micelles that can electrostatically capture the freshly etched material and, in a process that evokes pollination from bumblebees, increase redeposition efficiency.

         <title>Recent Progress on Self&#8208;Healable Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers are reviewed. Tunable electrical conductivity and mechanical properties, high stability in air and aqueous media, low cost, lightweight, flexibility, and, in some cases, biocompatibility make these materials attractive for numerous applications, such as energy harvesting devices, wearable and stretchable electronics, electronic skin, and implantable devices.








Abstract
Materials able to regenerate after damage have been the object of investigation since the ancient times. For instance, self&#8208;healing concretes, able to resist earthquakes, aging, weather, and seawater have been known since the times of ancient Rome and are still the object of research. During the last decade, there has been an increasing interest in self&#8208;healing electronic materials, for applications in electronic skin (E&#8208;skin) for health monitoring, wearable and stretchable sensors, actuators, transistors, energy harvesting, and storage devices. Self&#8208;healing materials based on conducting polymers are particularly attractive due to their tunable high conductivity, good stability, intrinsic flexibility, excellent processability and biocompatibility. Here recent developments are reviewed in the field of self&#8208;healing electronic materials based on conducting polymers, such as poly 3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene (PEDOT), polypyrrole (PPy), and polyaniline (PANI). The different types of healing, the strategies adopted to optimize electrical and mechanical properties, and the various possible healing mechanisms are introduced. Finally, the main challenges and perspectives in the field are discussed.

         <title>Recent Progress and Future Advances on Aqueous Monovalent&#8208;Ion Batteries towards Safe and High&#8208;Power Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have gained tremendous attention from the scientific community due to their fast charging capability, resulting from the outstanding ionic conductivity of aqueous electrolytes (twice as high as for organic electrolytes), and the smaller hydrated ionic radius and lower hydration free energy of monovalent ions compared with those of multivalent ions.








Abstract
Aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries have been rapidly developed recently as promising energy storage devices in large&#8208;scale energy storage systems owing to their fast charging capability and high power densities. In recent years, Prussian blue analogues, polyanion&#8208;type compounds, and layered oxides have been widely developed as cathodes for aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries because of their low cost and high theoretical capacity. Furthermore, many design strategies have been proposed to expand their electrochemical stability window by reducing the amount of free water molecules and introducing an electrolyte addictive. This review highlights the advantages and drawbacks of cathode and anode materials, and summarizes the correlations between the various strategies and the electrochemical performance in terms of structural engineering, morphology control, elemental compositions, and interfacial design. Finally, this review can offer rational principles and potential future directions in the design of aqueous monovalent&#8208;ion batteries.

Smart Contact lens (SCL) platforms have emerged as a promising interface between the eye and electronic devices for personalized healthcare applications. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art in material synthesis, device manufacturing, and system integrations of SCLs and provides recent progress and future opportunities of SCL as an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool.








Abstract
The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of noninvasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Smart Contact lens (SCL) platforms have emerged as a promising interface between the eye and electronic devices for personalized healthcare applications. This review summarizes the state-of-the-art in material synthesis, device manufacturing, and system integrations of SCLs and provides recent progress and future opportunities of SCL as an effective diagnostic and therapeutic tool.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The eye is one of the most complex organs in the human body, containing rich and critical physiological information (e.g., intraocular pressure, corneal temperature, and pH) as well as a library of metabolite biomarkers (e.g., glucose, proteins, and specific ions). Smart contact lenses (SCLs) can serve as a wearable intelligent ocular prosthetic device capable of noninvasive and continuous monitoring of various essential physical/biochemical parameters and drug loading/delivery for the treatment of ocular diseases. Advances in SCL technologies and the growing public interest in personalized health are accelerating SCL research more than ever before. Here, the current status and potential of SCL development through a comprehensive review from fabrication to applications to commercialization are discussed. First, the material, fabrication, and platform designs of the SCLs for the diagnostic and therapeutic applications are discussed. Then, the latest advances in diagnostic and therapeutic SCLs for clinical translation are reviewed. Later, the established techniques for wearable power transfer and wireless data transmission applied to current SCL devices are summarized. An outlook, future opportunities, and challenges for developing next-generation SCL&#160;devices are also provided. With the rise in interest of SCL development, this comprehensive and essential review can serve as a new paradigm for the SCL&#160;devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Antibody&#8208;Incorporated Nanomedicines for Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive review on the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanomedicines for cancer therapy is offered. Diverse functionalization strategies, antibody formats, and cancer&#8208;associated antigens are introduced and discussed, with an emphasis on their latest applications in antibody&#8208;incorporated nanotherapeutics. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also proposed.








Abstract
Antibody&#8208;based cancer therapy, one of the most significant therapeutic strategies, has achieved considerable success and progress over the past decades. Nevertheless, obstacles including limited tumor penetration, short circulation half&#8208;lives, undesired immunogenicity, and off&#8208;target side effects remain to be overcome for the antibody&#8208;based cancer treatment. Owing to the rapid development of nanotechnology, antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines that have been extensively explored to overcome these obstacles have already demonstrated enhanced anticancer efficacy and clinical translation potential. This review intends to offer an overview of the advancements of antibody&#8208;incorporated nanoparticulate systems in cancer treatment, together with the nontrivial challenges faced by these next&#8208;generation nanomedicines. Diverse strategies of antibody immobilization, formats of antibodies, types of cancer&#8208;associated antigens, and anticancer mechanisms of antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are provided and discussed in this review, with an emphasis on the latest applications. The current limitations and future research directions on antibody&#8208;containing nanomedicines are also discussed from different perspectives to provide new insights into the construction of anticancer nanomedicines.

         <title>Monolithic Perovskite&#8208;Silicon Tandem Solar Cells: From the Lab to Fab?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 24, June 16, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reviews the recent developments in the field of perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems, explores the feasibility to elevate efficiency to &gt;32%, analyzes the upscaling technology being compatible with the current silicon technology, and discusses the pathways to prolong its stability.








Abstract
This review focuses on monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem solar cells and discusses key scientific and technological challenges to address in view of an industrial implementation of this technology. The authors start by examining the different crystalline silicon (c&#8208;Si) technologies suitable for pairing with perovskites, followed by reviewing recent developments in the field of monolithic 2&#8208;terminal perovskite&#8208;silicon tandems. Factors limiting the power conversion efficiency of these tandem devices are then evaluated, before discussing pathways to achieve an efficiency of &gt;32%, a value that small&#8208;scale devices will likely need to achieve to make tandems competitive. Aspects related to the upscaling of these device active areas to industry&#8208;relevant ones are reviewed, followed by a short discussion on module integration aspects. The review then focuses on stability issues, likely the most challenging task that will eventually determine the economic viability of this technology. The final part of this review discusses alternative monolithic perovskite&#8208;silicon tandem designs. Finally, key areas of research that should be addressed to bring this technology from the lab to the fab are highlighted.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Dot Perovskite Spectrometer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
There are significant applications for miniature on&#8208;chip spectrometers in many fields. However, at present, on&#8208;chip spectrometers have to utilize an integrated strategy to achieve spectral analysis, which undoubtedly squanders the photosensitive area and adds pressure to the miniaturization of the spectrometer. Here, we demonstrate a unique spectrometer design that adopts a single detection point with in situ modulation realized by the photo&#8208;gain control at various bias voltages. With micrometre&#8208;level footprints, this single&#8208;dot spectrometer processes a resolution of about 5&#160;nm and a response time down to about 197 &#956;s. This is the first in situ perovskite modulation strategy that breaks the footprint&#8208;resolution restriction of spectrum analysis and demonstrates a new design direction for functional perovskite devices.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanoparticles with Surface&#8208;Mimicking Protein Secondary Structure As Lysosome&#8208;Targeting Chimaeras for Self&#8208;Synergistic Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Immunotherapy has received tremendous attention for tumor treatment, but the efficacy is greatly hindered by insufficient tumor&#8208;infiltration of immune cells and immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. The strategy that can efficiently activate cytotoxic T lymphocytes and inhibit negative immune regulators will greatly amplify immunotherapy outcome, which is however very rare. Herein, we develop a new kind of semiconducting polymer nanoparticles featured with surface&#8208;mimicking protein secondary structure (SPSS NPs) for self&#8208;synergistic cancer immunotherapy by combining immunogenic cell death (ICD) and immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. The semiconducting polymers with excellent photodynamic property are synthesized by rational fluorination, which could massively induce ICD. Additionally, the peptide antagonists are introduced and self&#8208;assembled into &#946;&#8208;sheet protein secondary structures on the photodynamic nanoparticle surface via preparation process optimization, which function as efficient lysosome&#8208;targeting chimaeras (LYTACs) to mediate the degradation of PD&#8208;L1 in lysosome. In vivo experiments demonstrate that SPSS NPs could not only elicit strong antitumor immunity to suppress the growth of both primary tumor and distant tumor, but also evoke long&#8208;term immunological memory against tumor rechallenge. This work introduces a new kind of robust immunotherapy agents by combining well&#8208;designed photosensitizer&#8208;based ICD induction and protein secondary structures&#8208;mediated LYTAC&#8208;like multivalence PD&#8208;L1 blockade, rendering great promise for synergistic immunotherapy.

         <title>Unraveling Device Physics of Dilute&#8208;Donor Narrow Band Gap Organic Solar Cells with Highly Transparent Active Layers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
This work investigates the charge generation&#8208;recombination dynamics in three narrow band gap near&#8208;IR absorbing NFA&#8208;based OPV systems with varied donor concentrations of 40%, 30%, and 20%. The dilution of the polymer donor with visible&#8208;range absorption leads to highly transparent active layers with blend AVTs of 64%, 70%, and 77%, respectively. Opaque devices in the optimized highly&#8208;reproducible device configuration comprising these transparent active layers lead to PCEs of 7.0%, 6.5%, and 4.1%. The investigation of these structures yields quantitative insights into changes in the charge generation, non&#8208;geminate charge recombination, and extraction dynamics upon dilution of the donor. Lastly, we give an outlook for employing the highly transparent active layers in ST&#8208;OPVs.

         <title>A Bionic Interface to Suppress the Coffee&#8208;Ring Effect for Reliable and Flexible Perovskite Modules with a Near&#8208;90% Yield Rate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of a superhydrophilic bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) significantly suppresses the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing of large&#8208;area perovskite films via regulating the nucleation rate (&#965;N) and radial transport rate (&#965;RT) of the perovskite precursor, which induces a homogeneous large&#8208;area flexible perovskite film and high&#8208;performance inverted flexible perovskite solar cells with an efficiency of 21.08%.








Abstract
The inhomogeneity, poor interfacial contact, and pinholes caused by the coffee&#8208;ring effect severely affect the printing reliability of flexible perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, inspired by the bio&#8208;glue of barnacles, a bionic interface layer (Bio&#8208;IL) of NiOx/levodopa is introduced to suppress the coffee&#8208;ring effect during printing perovskite modules. The coordination effect of the sticky functional groups in Bio&#8208;IL can pin the three&#8208;phase contact line and restrain the transport of perovskite colloidal particles during the printing and evaporation process. Moreover, the sedimentation rate of perovskite precursor is accelerated due to the electrostatic attraction and rapid volatilization from an extraordinary wettability. The superhydrophilic Bio&#8208;IL affords an even spread over a large&#8208;area substrate, which boosts a complete and uniform liquid film for heterogeneous nucleation as well as crystallization. Perovskite films on different large&#8208;area substrates with negligible coffee&#8208;ring effect are printed. Consequently, inverted flexible PSCs and perovskite solar modules achieve a high efficiency of 21.08% and 16.87%, respectively. This strategy ensures a highly reliable reproducibility of printing PSCs with a near 90% yield rate.

         <title>Self&#8208;Powered Active Sensing Based on Triboelectric Generators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;powered triboelectric nanogenerator (TENG)&#8208;based active sensors are vital for digital transformation and can be designed into wearable and flexible form factors. The evolution of TENG&#8208;based active sensors is outlined with primary focus on chemical and biosensors. Comprehensive discussion on the device mechanism, applications, sensing parameters is provided and the challenges in the field detailed.








Abstract
The demand for portable and wearable chemical or biosensors and their expeditious development in recent years has created a scientific challenge in terms of their continuous powering. As a result, mechanical energy harvesters such as piezoelectric and triboelectric generators (TEGs) have been explored recently either as sensors or harvesters to store charge in small, but long&#8208;life, energy&#8208;storage devices to power the sensors. The use of energy harvesters as sensors is particularly interesting, as with such multifunctional operations it is possible to reduce the number devices needed in a system, which also helps overcome the integration complexities. In this regard, TEGs are promising, particularly for energy autonomous chemical and biological sensors, as they can be developed with a wide variety of materials, and their mechanical energy to electricity conversion can be modulated by various analytes. This review focuses on this interesting dimension of TEGs and presents various self&#8208;powered active chemical and biological sensors. A brief discussion about the development of TEG&#8208;based physical, magnetic, and optical sensors is also included. The influence of environmental factors, various figures of merit, and the significance of TEG design are explained in context with the active sensing. Finally, the key applications, challenges, and future perspective of chemical and biological detection via TEGs are discussed with a view to drive further advances in the field of self&#8208;powered sensors.

         <title>Room&#8208;temperature Annealing&#8208;free Gold Printing via Anion&#8208;assisted Photochemical Deposition</title>

Abstract
Metal patterning via additive manufacturing has been phasing&#8208;in to broad applications in many medical, electronics, aerospace, and automotive industries. While previous efforts have produced various promising metal patterning strategies, their complexity and high cost limited their practical application in rapid production and prototyping. Herein, we introduce a one&#8208;step gold printing technique based on anion&#8208;assisted photochemical deposition (APD), which can directly print highly conductive gold patterns (1.08&#215;107 S m&#8211;1) under ambient conditions without post&#8208;annealing treatment. Uniquely, the APD uses specific ion effects with projection lithography to pattern Au nanoparticles and simultaneously sinter them into tunable porous gold structures. We present the significant influence of kosmotropic or chaotropic anions in the precursor ink on tuning the morphologies and conductivities of the printed patterns by employing a series of different ions, including Cl&#8211; ions, in the printing process. Additionally, the resistance stabilities and the electrochemical properties of the APD&#8208;printed gold patterns are carefully investigated. We demonstrate the high conductivity and excellent conformability of the printed Au electrodes with its reliable performance in electrophysiological signal delivery and acquisition for biomedical applications. Our work exploits the potential of photochemical deposition&#8208;based metal patterning in flexible electronic manufacturing.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Potassium&#8208;Metal Battery Enabled by a Directly Grown Graphene&#8208;Modulated Aluminum Current Collector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from a plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition setup integrated with a roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll configuration, a commercial Al foil is elaborately decorated with a graphene layer with strong adhesion and high surface energy, which enables a smooth and highly reversible K plating/stripping process. An anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell using the as&#8208;synthesized substrate as the anode current collector displays improved performance.








Abstract
Potassium (K)&#8208;metal batteries have emerged as a promising energy&#8208;storage device owing to abundant K resources. An anode&#8208;free architecture that bypasses the need for anode host materials can deliver an elevated energy density. However, the poor efficiency of K plating/stripping on potassiophobic anode current collectors results in rapid K inventory loss and a short cycle life. Herein, commercial Al foils are decorated with an ultrathin graphene&#8208;modified layer (Al@G) through roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll plasma&#8208;enhanced chemical vapor deposition. By harnessing strong adhesion (10.52 N m&#8722;1) and a high surface energy (66.6 mJ m&#8722;2), the designed Al@G structure ensures a highly smooth and ordered K plating/stripping process. Consequently, during K&#8208;metal plating/stripping, Al@G can operate at a current density of up to 4.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and cyclic capacity of up to 4.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, with an ultralong lifespan of up to 1000 h at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and stable cycling of up to 750 h under periodic current fluctuations of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In addition, a novel anode&#8208;free K&#8208;metal full&#8208;cell prototype enabled by Al@G anode current collectors is constructed, demonstrating ameliorative cyclic stability.

         <title>Personalized Electronic Tattoo for Healthcare Realized by On&#8208;the&#8208;spot Assembly of Intrinsically Conductive and Durable Liquid&#8208;metal&#8208;composite</title>

Abstract
Conventional electronic (e&#8208;) skins are a class of thin&#8208;film electronics mainly fabricated in laboratories or factories, which is incapable of rapid and simple customization for personalized healthcare. Here, we introduce a new class of e&#8208;tattoos that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one&#8208;step coating with various designs at multi&#8208;scale depending on the purpose of the user without substrate. E&#8208;tattoo is realized by attaching Pt&#8208;decorated carbon nanotube on gallium&#8208;based liquid&#8208;metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low&#8208;zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high&#8208;vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 seconds. Low&#8208;cost, ease of preparation, on&#8208;skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e&#8208;tattoo. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulator, photothermal patch, motion artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological sensor, and electrochemical biosensor validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e&#8208;tattoo&#8208;based approach in biomedical engineering.

Here, we introduce a new class of e-tattoos that can be directly implemented on the skin by facile one-step coating with various designs at multi-scale depending on the purpose of the user without substrate. E-tattoo is realized by attaching Pt-decorated carbon nanotube on gallium-based liquid-metal particles (CMP) to impose intrinsic electrical conductivity and mechanical durability. Tuning the CMP suspension to have low-zeta potential, excellent wettability, and high-vapor pressure enables conformal and intimate assembly of particles directly on the skin in 10 seconds. Low-cost, ease of preparation, on-skin compatibility, and multifunctionality of CMP make it highly suitable for e-tattoo. Demonstrations of electrical muscle stimulator, photothermal patch, motion artifact-free electrophysiological sensor, and electrochemical biosensor validate the simplicity, versatility, and reliability of the e-tattoo-based approach in biomedical engineering.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Using Machine Learning to Predict and Understand Complex Self&#8208;Assembly Behaviors of a Multicomponent Nanocomposite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Blends of nanoparticles, polymers, and small molecules can self&#8208;assemble into optical, magnetic, and electronic devices with structure&#8208;dependent properties. However, the relationship between a multicomponent nanocomposite's composition and its assembled structure is complex, and cannot be predicted by theory. The blends are strongly influenced by processing conditions, which can introduce non&#8208;equilibrium states. Currently, nanocomposite devices are designed through cycles of experimental trial and error. Machine learning (ML) methods are a compelling alternative, because they can use existing data&#8208;sets to map high&#8208;dimensional spaces. These methods do not rely on known relationships between parameters, so they are suited to complex systems without a solid theoretical foundation. Here, a dataset of 595 microscope images of nanocomposite thin films are used to train a series of ML models. Correlations between the input and output parameters are examined, providing new insights into the system. Finally, the most successful ML model is used to predict the structures of new nanocomposite compositions. The results confirm that ML techniques can be used to improve the efficiency of nanocomposite device design. More broadly, the current study suggests some of the advantages and challenges associated with applying ML to complex systems.

         <title>Self&#8208;powered Stretchable Sensor Arrays Exhibiting Magnetoelasticity for Real&#8208;Time Human&#8208;Machine Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Stretchable strain sensors are highly desirable for human motion monitoring, and can be used to build new forms of bionic robot. However, the current use of flexible strain gauges is hindered by the need for an external power supply, and the demand for long&#8208;term operation. Here, we present a new flexible self&#8208;powered strain sensor system based on an electromagnetic generator which possesses a high stretchability in excess of 150%, a short response time of 30&#160;ms, and an excellent linearity (R2 &gt; 0.98). Based on this new form of sensor, a human&#8208;machine interaction (HMI) system was designed to achieve remote control of a robot hand and vehicle using a human hand, which provides a new scheme for real&#8208;time gesture interaction.

         <title>Key Factors Affecting the Stability of CsPbI3 Perovskite Quantum Dot Solar Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The power conversion efficiency of CsPbI3 perovskite quantum dot (PQD) solar cells has increased from 10.77% to 16.2% in a short period owing to advances in material and device design for solar cells. However, the device stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells remained poor in ambient conditions, which requires an in&#8208;depth understanding of the degradation mechanisms of CsPbI3 PQDs solar cells in terms of both inherent material properties and device characteristics. Along with this analysis, advanced strategies to overcome poor device stability must be conceived. In this review, fundamental mechanisms that cause the degradation of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells are discussed from the material property and device viewpoints. In addition, based on detailed insights into degradation mechanisms in CsPbI3 PQD solar cells, various strategies are introduced to improve the stability of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. Finally, future perspectives and challenges are presented to achieve highly durable CsPbI3 PQD solar cells. The investigation of the degradation mechanisms and the stability enhancement strategies can pave the way for the commercialization of CsPbI3 PQD solar cells.

         <title>Efficient Photons Extraction in Top&#8208;Emission Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Devices Based on Ampicillin Micro&#8208;Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The desire to enhance the efficiency of organic light&#8208;emitting devices (OLEDs) has driven to the investigation of advanced materials with fascinating properties. Here, the efficiency of top&#8208;emission OLEDs (TEOLEDs) is enhanced by introducing ampicillin microstructures (Amp&#8208;MSs) with dual phases (&#945;&#8208;/&#946;&#8208;phase) that induce photoluminescence (PL) and electroluminescence (EL). Moreover, Amp&#8208;MSs can adjust the charge&#8208;balance by Fermi&#8208;level (EF) alignment, thereby decreasing the leakage current. The decrease in the wave&#8208;guided modes can enhance the light&#8208;outcoupling through optical&#8208;scattering. The resulting TEOLED demonstrates a record&#8208;high external&#8208;quantum&#8208;efficiency (EQE) (maximum: 68.7% and average: 63.4% at spectroradiometer; maximum: 44.8% and average: 42.6% at integrating sphere) with a wider color&#8208;gamut (118%) owing to the red&#8208;shift of the spectrum by J&#8208;aggregation. The deconvolution of EL intensities is performed to clarify the contribution of Amp&#8208;MSs to the device EQE enhancement (optical&#8208;scattering by Amp&#8208;MSs: 17.0%, PL by radiative energy transfer: 9.1% and EL by J&#8208;aggregated excitons: 4.6%). The proposed TEOLED outperforms the existing frameworks in terms of device efficiency.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Sodium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries: Rules for Catalyst Selection and Electrode Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Seeking an optimal catalyst to accelerate conversion reaction kinetics of room&#8208;temperature sodium&#8208;sulfur (RT Na&#8208;S) batteries is crucial for improving their electrochemical performance and promoting the practical applications. Herein, we propose systematically theoretical calculations of interfacial interactions of catalysts and polysulfides in terms of the surface adsorption state, interfacial ions migration and electronic concentration around the Fermi level as guiding principles of catalyst selection for RT Na&#8208;S batteries. As a case, MoN catalyst is accurately selected from transition metal nitrides with different d orbital electrons, and for experiment, it is introduced into the carbon nanofibers as a dual&#8208;functioning host (MoN@CNFs). The MoN@CNFs can effectively anchor polysulfides and accelerate their conversion reaction. In addition, for the sodium anode, the MoN@CNFs can also induce uniform deposition of Na and inhibit dendrite growth, which are supported by in situ characterizations and finite element simulation technique. As a result, the as&#8208;prepared RT Na&#8208;S battery displays high reversible capacity of 990 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.2 A g&#8211;1 after 100 cycles and long lifespan over 1500 cycles at 2 A g&#8211;1. Even with high S loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8211;2, the RT Na&#8208;S battery still exhibits a high areal capacity of 2.5 mAh cm&#8211;2.

         <title>Concentrated electrolytes enabling stable aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion batteries</title>

Abstract
Rechargeable aqueous batteries are promising devices for large&#8208;scale energy storage applications because of their low&#8208;cost, inherent safety, and environmental friendliness. Among them, aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIB) are currently emerging owing to the fast diffusion kinetics of NH4+. Nevertheless, it is still a challenge to obtain stable AAIB with relatively high output potential, considering the instability of many electrode materials in an aqueous environment. Herein, we report a cell based on a concentrated (5.8m) aqueous (NH4)2SO4 electrolyte, ammonium copper hexacyanoferrate (N&#8208;CuHCF) as the positiveelectrode (cathode), and 3,4,9,10&#8208;Perylene&#8208;bis(dicarboximide) (PTCDI) as the negative electrode (anode). The solvation structure, electrochemical properties, as well as the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface and interphase are systematically investigated by the combination of theoretical and experimental methods. The results indicate for a remarkable cyling performance of the low&#8208;cost rocking&#8208;chair AAIB, which offers a capacity retention of around 72% after 1000 cycles and an average output potential of around 1.0&#160;V.

         <title>Nonhalogenated Dual&#8208;Slot&#8208;Die Processing Enables High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin&#8208;coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) which causes excessive charge recombination hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, we propose a simple but effective dual&#8208;slot&#8208;die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the non&#8208;halogen solvents, and creating a Graded&#8208;BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% was obtained with the device processed with o&#8208;xylene in an open&#8208;air environment with no post&#8208;treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% was preserved in a wide range of active layer thickness. We further identified the unique film&#8208;formation mechanism during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the Graded&#8208;BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation. The Graded&#8208;BHJ structure leads to improved charge transport, inhibited charge recombination, and thus an excellent PCE. Therefore, the newly&#8208;developed DSDS approach can effectively contribute to the realm of high&#8208;efficiency and eco&#8208;friendly OSCs, which can also possibly be generalized to other organic photoelectric devices.

&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells (OSCs) are promising candidates for the next-generation photovoltaic technologies, with their power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) reaching 19%. However, the typically used spin-coating method, toxic halogenated processing solvents, and the conventional bulk-heterojunction (BHJ) which causes excessive charge recombination hamper the commercialization and further efficiency promotion of OSCs. Here, we propose a simple but effective dual-slot-die sequential processing (DSDS) strategy to address the above issues by achieving a continuous solution supply, avoiding the solubility limit of the non-halogen solvents, and creating a Graded-BHJ morphology. As a result, an excellent PCE of 17.07% was obtained with the device processed with o-xylene in an open-air environment with no post-treatment required, while a PCE of over 14% was preserved in a wide range of active layer thickness. We further identified the unique film-formation mechanism during the DSDS processing, which suggests the formation of the Graded-BHJ morphology by the mutual diffusion between donor and acceptor and the subsequent progressive aggregation.

         <title>Graphene&#8208;based Intrinsically Stretchable Two&#8208;Dimensional&#8208;Contact Electrodes for Highly Efficient Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (ISOLEDs) are becoming essential components of wearable electronics. However, the efficiencies of the ISOLEDs have been highly inferior to their rigid counterparts, which is due to the lack of ideal stretchable electrode materials that can overcome the poor charge injection at one&#8208;dimensional metallic nanowire/organic interfaces. We demonstrate highly&#8208;efficient ISOLEDs that use graphene&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional&#8208;contact stretchable electrodes (TCSEs) that incorporate a graphene layer on top of embedded metallic nanowires. The graphene layer modifies the work function, promotes charge spreading, and impedes inward diffusion of oxygen and moisture. The work function (WF) of 3.57&#160;eV is achieved by forming a strong interfacial dipole after deposition of a newly&#8208;designed conjugated polyelectrolyte with crown ether and anionic sulfonate groups on TCSE; this is the lowest value ever reported among ISOLEDs, which overcomes the existing problem of very poor electron injection in ISOLEDs. Subsequent pressure&#8208;controlled lamination yielded a highly efficient fluorescent ISOLED with an unprecedently high current efficiency of 20.3&#160;cd/A, which even exceeds that of an otherwise&#8208;identical rigid counterpart. Lastly, a three&#8208;inch five&#8208;by&#8208;five passive matrix ISOLED was demonstrated using convex stretching. This work can provide a rational protocol for designing intrinsically stretchable high&#8208;efficiency optoelectronic devices with favorable interfacial electronic structures.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Based Hollow Mesoporous Nanoparticles: Synthesis Strategies and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in the synthesis and catalysis&#8208;related applications of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based hollow mesoporous nanoparticles (HMNs) is summarized in detail. This Review will help the readers to understand the challenges and more importantly provide insights into designing novel multifunctional HMN&#8208;based nanomaterials.








Abstract
As second&#8208;generation mesoporous materials, mesoporous noble metals (NMs) are of significant interest for their wide applications in catalysis, sensing, bioimaging, and biotherapy owing to their structural and metallic features. The introduction of interior hollow cavity into NM&#8208;based mesoporous nanoparticles (MNs), which subtly integrate hierarchical hollow and mesoporous structure into one nanoparticle, produces a new type of hollow MNs (HMNs). Benefiting from their higher active surface, better electron/mass transfer, optimum electronic structure, and nanoconfinement space, NM&#8208;based HMNs exhibit their high efficiency in enhancing catalytic activity and stability and tuning catalytic selectivity. In this review, recent progress in the design, synthesis, and catalytic applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is summarized, including the findings of the groups. Five main strategies for synthesizing NM&#8208;based HMNs, namely silica&#8208;assisted surfactant&#8208;templated nucleation, surfactant&#8208;templated sequential nucleation, soft &#8220;dual&#8221;&#8208;template, Kirkendall effect in synergistic template, and galvanic&#8208;replacement&#8208;assisted surfactant template, are described in detail. In addition, the applications in ethanol oxidation electrocatalysis and hydrogenation reactions are discussed to highlight the high activity, enhanced stability, and optimal selectivity of NM&#8208;based HMNs in (electro)catalysis. Finally, the further outlook that may lead the directions of synthesis and applications of NM&#8208;based HMNs is prospected.

         <title>Isolated&#8208;Oxygen&#8208;Vacancy Hardening in Lead&#8208;Free Piezoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy is developed for the hardening of piezoelectrics via the mediation of dopant&#8208;exclusive oxygen vacancies to overcome the long&#8208;term issue: the dilemma between the mechanical quality factor and piezoelectricity coefficient. The approach also makes the high&#8208;power performance superior to many state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterparts, offering a possible route to various piezoelectrics for high&#8208;end applications.








Abstract
Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established approach to customize the functionalities of perovskite oxides. In demanding high&#8208;power applications of piezoelectric materials, acceptor doping serves as the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art hardening approach, but inevitably deteriorates the electromechanical properties. Here, a new hardening effect associated with isolated oxygen vacancies for achieving well&#8208;balanced performances is proposed. Guided by theoretical design, a well&#8208;balanced performance of mechanical quality factor (Qm) and piezoelectric coefficient (d33) is achieved in lead&#8208;free potassium sodium niobate ceramics, where Qm increases by over 60% while d33 remains almost unchanged. By atomic&#8208;scale Z&#8208;contrast imaging, hysteresis measurement, and quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy analysis, it is revealed that the improved Qm results from the inhibition of both extrinsic and intrinsic losses while the unchanged d33 is associated with the polarization contributions being retained. More encouragingly, the hardening effect shows exceptional stability with increasing vibration velocity, offering potential in material design for practical high&#8208;power applications such as pharmaceutical extraction and ultrasonic osteotomes.

         <title>Asymmetric Substitution of End&#8208;Groups Triggers 16.34% Efficiency for All&#8208;Small&#8208;Molecule Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Asymmetric substitution of terminal groups is first applied in small&#8208;molecule donors. A record efficiency of 16.34% is achieved for binary all&#8208;small&#8208;molecule organic solar cells. A unique phenomenon of merits integration is reported rather than the balance between Voc and Jsc, which is generally observed in asymmetric substitution of nonfullerene acceptors.








Abstract
Asymmetric substitution of end&#8208;groups is first applied in molecular donors. Three commonly used end&#8208;groups of 2&#8208;ethylhexyl cyanoacetate (CA), 2&#8208;ethylhexyl rhodanine (Reh), and 1H&#8208;indene&#8208;1,3(2H)&#8208;dione (ID) are combined to construct a series of symmetric and asymmetric donors. Correspondingly, the asymmetric donors SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh and SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID show largely increased dipole moments (2.14 and 3.39 D, respectively) and enhanced aggregation propensity, as compared to those of symmetric donors of SM&#8208;CA, SM&#8208;Reh, and SM&#8208;ID. Using N3 as acceptor, interestingly, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh integrates the photovoltaic characteristics of high fill factor (FF) for SM&#8208;CA and high short&#8208;circuit current density for SM&#8208;Reh, and delivers a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 16.34% with a high FF of 77.5%, which is much higher than 15.41% for SM&#8208;CA and 14.76% for SM&#8208;Reh. However, SM&#8208;CA&#8208;ID and SM&#8208;ID give the lower PCE of 8.20% and 2.76%. Characterization results suggest that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction mainly dictates the packing morphology of blend films instead of dipole effect or crystallinity. Mono&#8208;substitution of Reh facilitates the molecular demixing appropriately but keeps the characteristic of the fine bicontinuous network of SM&#8208;CA:N3. SM&#8208;CA&#8208;Reh:N3 shows more efficient exciton extraction, higher hole transport, and better miscibility. These results well explain the merits integration and improved photovoltaic performance.

         <title>2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide with Increased Entropy for Piezoelectric Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The 2D transition metal dichalcogenide alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, is synthesized to investigate the influence of configurational entropy on the piezoelectrical property. Mo0.46W0.54S2, in which two cations have similar concentrations and the maximum configurational entropy is attained, exhibits the best piezoelectric properties. Combined with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.








Abstract
Piezoelectricity in 2D transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has attracted considerable interest because of their excellent flexibility and high piezoelectric coefficient compared to conventional piezoelectric bulk materials. However, the ability to regulate the piezoelectric properties is limited because the entropy is constant for certain binary TMDs other than multielement ones. Herein, in order to increase the entropy, a ternary TMDs alloy, Mo1&#8722;xWxS2, with different W concentrations, is synthesized. The W concentration in the Mo1&#8722;xWxS2 alloy can be controlled precisely in the low&#8208;supersaturation synthesis and the entropy can be tuned accordingly. The Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy (x&#160;= 0.54) has the highest configurational entropy and best piezoelectric properties, such as a piezoelectric coefficient of 4.22 pm V&#8722;1 and a piezoelectric output current of 150 pA at 0.24% strain. More importantly, it can be combined into a larger package to increase the output current to 600 pA to cater to self&#8208;powered applications. Combining with excellent mechanical durability, a mechanical sensor based on the Mo0.46W0.54S2 alloy is demonstrated for real&#8208;time health monitoring.

         <title>All&#8208;Aqueous Freeform Fabrication of Perfusable Self&#8208;Standing Soft Compartments</title>

Abstract
Compartmentalized structures obtained in all&#8208;aqueous settings have shown promising properties as cell encapsulation devices, as well as reactors for trans&#8208;membrane chemical reactions. While most approaches focus on the preparation of spherical devices, advances on the production of complex architectures have been enabled by the interfacial stability conferred by emulsion systems, namely mild&#160;aqueous two&#8208;phase systems (ATPS), or non&#8208;equilibrated analogues. However, the application of non&#8208;spherical structures has mostly been reported while keeping the fabricated materials at a stable interface, limiting the free&#8208;standing character, mobility, and transposition of the obtained structures to different setups. Here, we show the fabrication of self&#8208;standing, malleable and perfusable tubular systems through all&#8208;aqueous interfacial assembly, culminating in the preparation of independent objects with stability and homogeneity after disruption of the polymer&#8208;based aqueous separating system. Those hollow structures could be fabricated with a variety of widths, and rapidly printed as long structures at flow rates of 15&#160;mm s&#8211;1. The materials were used as compartments for cell culture, showcasing high cytocompatibility, and could be tailored to promote&#160;cell adhesion. Such structures may find application in fields that benefit from freeform tubular structures, including the biomedical field with, e.g., cell encapsulation, and benchtop preparation of microfluidic devices.

         <title>Immunoregulation in Diabetic Wound Repair with a Photoenhanced Glycyrrhizic Acid Hydrogel Scaffold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a glycyrrhizic acid (GA) hybrid hydrogel is developed as an immunoregulatory scaffold for diabetic wound repair. This hybrid hydrogel consists of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA as a first network and photoenhanced methyl acrylylated silk fibroin as a second network, realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, this hybrid hydrogel could regulate macrophage responses without exogenous addition.








Abstract
M1 macrophage accumulation and excessive inflammation are commonly encountered issues in diabetic wounds and can fail in the healing process. Hence, hydrogel dressings with immunoregulatory capacity have great promise in the clinical practice of diabetic wound healing. However, current immunoregulatory hydrogels are always needed for complex interventions and high&#8208;cost treatments, such as cytokines and cell therapies. In this study, a novel glycyrrhizic acid (GA)&#8208;based hybrid hydrogel dressing with intrinsic immunoregulatory properties is developed to promote rapid diabetic wound healing. This hybrid hydrogel consists of interpenetrating polymer networks composed of inorganic Zn2+&#8208;induced self&#8208;assembled GA and photo&#8208;crosslinked methyl acrylated silk fibroin (SF), realizing both excellent injectability and mechanical strength. Notably, the SF/GA/Zn hybrid hydrogel can regulate macrophage responses in the inflammatory microenvironment, circumventing the use of any additives. The immunomodulatory properties of the hydrogel can be harnessed for safe and efficient therapeutics that accelerate the three phases of wound repair and serve as a promising dressing for the management of diabetic wounds.

Abstract
E&#8208;waste is rapidly turning into another man&#8208;made disaster. We propose that a paradigm shift toward a more sustainable future can be made through soft&#8208;matter electronics that are resilient, repairable if damaged, and recyclable (3R), provided that they achieve the same level of maturity as industrial electronics. This includes high&#8208;resolution patterning, multi&#8208;layer implementation, microchip integration, and automated fabrication. Herein, a novel architecture of materials and methods for microchip&#8208;integrated condensed soft&#8208;matter 3R electronics is demonstrated. The 3R function is enabled by a biphasic liquid metal&#8208;based composite, a block copolymer with non&#8208;permanent physical crosslinks, and an electrochemical technique for material recycling. In addition, an autonomous laser&#8208;patterning method for scalable circuit patterning with an exceptional resolution of &lt;30&#160;&#956;m in seconds is developed. The phase&#8208;shifting property of the BCPs is utilized for vapor&#8208;assisted &#8220;soldering&#8221; circuit repairing and recycling. The process is performed entirely at room temperature, thereby opening the door for a wide range of heat&#8208;sensitive and biodegradable polymers for the next generation of green electronics. We demonstrate the implementation and recycling of sophisticated skin&#8208;mounted patches with embedded sensors, electrodes, antennas, and microchips that build a digital fingerprint of the human electrophysiological signals by collecting mechanical, electrical, optical, and thermal data from the epidermis.

         <title>A Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Green OLED with 4500 h Lifetime and 20% External Quantum Efficiency by Optimizing the Emission Zone using a Single&#8208;Emission Spectrum Technique</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An accessible, fast procedure is shown to measure light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) emission zones with current density, different device structures, and ageing. The emission zone in an organic LED is shown to be controlled by emitter doping and to have a strong relationship with device degradation and lifetime. Using the resulting insights, record stability for a thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) organic LED is shown.








Abstract
Device optimization of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) targets the most efficient conversion of electrically injected charges into emitted light. The emission zone in an LED is where charges recombine and light is emitted from. It is believed that the emission zone is strongly linked to device efficiency and lifetime. However, the emission zone size is below the optical diffraction limit, so it is difficult to measure. An accessible method based on a single emission spectrum that enables emission zone measurements with sub&#8208;second time resolution is shown. A procedure is introduced to study and control the emission zone of an LED system and correlate it with device performance. A thermally activated delayed fluorescence organic LED emission zone is experimentally measured over all luminescing current densities, while varying the device structure and while ageing. The emission zone is shown to be finely controlled by emitter doping because electron transport via the emitter is the charge&#8208;transport bottleneck of the system. Suspected quenching/degradation mechanisms are linked with the emission zone changes, device structure variation, and ageing. Using these findings, a device with an ultralong 4500 h T95 lifetime at 1000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 with 20% external quantum efficiency is shown.

         <title>Molecular&#8208;Level Methylcellulose/MXene Hybrids with Greatly Enhanced Electrochemical Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Methylcellulose chains are introduced between MXene sheets to obtain molecular&#8208;level hybrid films with simultaneously enhanced ambient stability and wet strength. The hybrid films also show significantly enhanced actuation strain due to the enlarged layer distance and possible in&#8208;plane sliding of MXene. A hybrid&#8208;based soft actuator shows an unprecedentedly high modulus and a strain difference up to 0.541% under&#160;1&#160;V.








Abstract
Ti3C2Tx MXene film is promising for electrochemical actuators due to its high electrical conductivity and volumetric capacitance. However, its actuation performance is limited by the slow ion diffusion through the film and poor mechanical property in aqueous electrolytes. Here, molecular&#8208;level methylcellulose (MC)/MXene hybrid films are assembled with obviously enlarged layer distance, improved wet strength, and ambient stability. The hybrid films show significantly higher in&#8208;plane actuation strain in a liquid electrolyte. Based on direct strain measurements, in&#160;situ X&#8208;ray diffraction (XRD) and ex&#160;situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analyses, the actuation enhancement can be ascribed to the enlarged layer distance allowing more water and ions to be intercalated/de&#8208;intercalated and MC&#8208;induced sliding of MXene sheets. The assembled soft actuator has a high Young's modulus of 1.93&#160;GPa and can be operated in air, generating a peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain difference up to 0.541% under a triangular wave voltage of &#177;1&#160;V&#160;and a blocking force of 4.7&#160;times its own weight.

         <title>Structurally Resemblant Dopants Enhance Organic Room&#8208;Temperature Phosphorescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient doping strategy is applied to endow bright room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) of dibenzothiophene derivatives. The isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy gap between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states enable bright RTP.








Abstract
Doping has shown very promising potential in endowing room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP) properties of organic phosphors with minimal effort. Here, a new isomer design and doping strategy is reported that is applicable to dibenzothiophene (DBT) and its derivatives. Three isomers are synthesized to study the dopant effect on enhancing RTP of DBT derivatives. It is found that isomer dopants bearing close resemblance to the host with matched highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energy levels and small energy difference between singlet&#8208; and triplet&#8208;excited states can yield efficient RTP for the doped system. Meanwhile, phosphorescence color from yellow to red is achieved by varying isomer dopants used for doping the DBT derivatives. This work represents an RTP enhancement strategy based on isomer design and doping to construct luminescent organic phosphors.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Narrowband Pure&#8208;Red OLEDs with External Quantum Efficiencies up to 36.1% and Ultralow Efficiency Roll&#8208;Off</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of narrowband red emitters with superb photophysical properties is developed by way of novel B/N/O&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance structures. The red OLEDs incorporating these emitters sensitized by the phosphor display state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art performance with EQE exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off, ultrahigh brightness, and good device lifetime.








Abstract
High&#8208;color&#8208;purity blue and green organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have been resolved thanks to the development of B/N&#8208;based polycyclic multiple resonance (MR) emitters. However, due to the derivatization limit of B/N polycyclic structures, the design of red MR emitters remains challenging. Herein, a series of novel red MR emitters is reported by para&#8208;positioning N&#8211;&#960;&#8211;N, O&#8211;&#960;&#8211;O, B&#8211;&#960;&#8211;B pairs onto a benzene ring to construct an MR central core. These emitters can be facilely and modularly synthesized, allowing for easy fine&#8208;tuning of emission spectra by peripheral groups. Moreover, these red MR emitters display excellent photophysical properties such as near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), fast radiative decay rate (kr) up to 7.4 &#215; 107 s&#8722;1, and most importantly, narrowband emission with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 32&#160;nm. Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll&#8208;off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), ultrahigh brightness over 130&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, together with good device lifetime.

Incorporating these MR emitters, pure red OLEDs sensitized by phosphor realize state-of-the-art device performances with external quantum efficiency (EQE) exceeding 36%, ultralow efficiency roll-off (EQE remains as high as 25.1% at the brightness of 50&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;), ultrahigh brightness over 130&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, together with good device lifetime.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Mesopore&#8208;Rich Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C Catalyst with FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NC Single&#8208;Atom Sites Delivers Remarkable Oxygen Reduction Reaction Performance in Alkaline Media</title>

An Fe single&#8208;atom catalyst (FeN4&#8208;O&#8211;NCR) based on O,N&#8208;codoped carbon nanorods delivers remarkable oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) performance in a primary zinc&#8211;air battery. The Fe atoms in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR are coordinated by four in&#8208;plane N atoms and a subsurface axial oxygen atom that bridge between N&#8208;doped graphene sheets, thus optimizing the Fe d&#8208;band center position and binding energies of ORR intermediates.








Abstract
Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts offer excellent performance for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media. With a view toward boosting the intrinsic ORR activity of Fe single&#8208;atom sites in Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts, fine&#8208;tuning the local coordination of the Fe sites to optimize the binding energies of ORR intermediates is imperative. Herein, a porous FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR electrocatalyst rich in catalytically accessible FeN4&#8211;O sites (wherein the Fe single atoms are coordinated to four in&#8208;plane nitrogen atoms and one subsurface axial oxygen atom) supported on N&#8208;doped carbon nanorods (NCR) is reported. Fe K&#8208;edge X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) verifies the presence of FeN4&#8211;O active sites in FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR, while density functional theory calculations reveal that the FeN4&#8211;O coordination offers a lower energy and more selective 4&#8208;electron/4&#8208;proton ORR pathway compared to traditional FeN4 sites. Electrochemical tests validate the outstanding intrinsic activity of FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR for alkaline ORR, outperforming Pt/C and almost all other M&#8211;N&#8211;C catalysts reported to date. A primary zinc&#8211;air battery constructed using FeN4&#8211;O&#8211;NCR delivers a peak power density of 214.2&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 at a current density of 334.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, highlighting the benefits of optimizing the local coordination of iron single atoms.

         <title>General Synthesis and Solution Processing of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose, can be employed for the synthesis of high&#8208;quality metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOF) materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. The good solution dispersibility and membrane formability of MOF nanofibers surpass traditional MOF powder materials, which facilitates their processing and application.








Abstract
By virtue of their extraordinarily high surface areas, ordered pore structures, various compositions, and rich functionality, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are of great interest in diverse fields such as gas separation, sensing, catalysis, energy, environment science, and biomedicine. However, the difficulty in processing MOF crystals and controlling the MOF superstructure is emerging as a critical issue in their application. Herein, it is reported that a robust template, i.e., nanofibrillated cellulose (NFC), can be used for the synthesis of MOF materials with 1D nanofiber morphology. NFC@MOF core&#8211;shell nanofibers with a uniform network structure and high aspect ratios can be prepared by use of this template. The small crystal size, flexibility, and good dispersity of the NFC@MOF nanofibers make it convenient for the macroscale assembly and solution processing of MOF materials. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept study is demonstrated wherein freestanding MOF nanofiber membranes represent good performance in applications of water treatment and heterogeneous catalysis reaction. This general synthesis and solution&#8208;processing strategy may herald a new era in promoting the industrial application of MOFs.

         <title>A Transparent, High&#8208;Performance, and Stable Sb2S3 Photoanode Enabled by Heterojunction Engineering with Conjugated Polycarbazole Frameworks for Unbiased Photoelectrochemical Overall Water Splitting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole framework onto the surface of transparent Sb2S3 thin film creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction, leading to a transparent, high&#8208;performance, and stable hybrid photoanode. When coupled with a bandgap&#8208;matched back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode, the unbiased photoelectrochemical tandem device demonstrates an unprecedented efficiency of 5.21% toward solar&#8208;driven overall water splitting.








Abstract
Developing low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;performance, and durable photoanodes is essential in solar&#8208;driven photoelectrochemical (PEC) energy conversion. Sb2S3 is a low&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.7&#160;eV) n&#8208;type semiconductor with a maximum theoretical solar conversion efficiency of &#8776;28% for PEC water splitting. However, bulk Sb2S3 exhibits opaque characteristics and suffers from severe photocorrosion, and thus the use of Sb2S3 as a photoanode material remains underexploited. This study describes the design and fabrication of a transparent Sb2S3&#8208;based photoanode by conformably depositing a thin layer of conjugated polycarbazole frameworks (CPF&#8208;TCzB) onto the Sb2S3 film. This structural design creates a type&#8208;II heterojunction between the CPF&#8208;TCzB and the Sb2S3 with a suitable band&#8208;edge energy offset, thereby, greatly enhancing the charge separation efficiency. The CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 hybrid photoanode exhibits a remarkable photocurrent density of 10.1&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at 1.23&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode. Moreover, the thin CPF&#8208;TCzB overlayer effectively inhibits photocorrosion of the Sb2S3 and enables long&#8208;term operation for at least 100&#160;h with &#8776;10% loss in photocurrent density. Furthermore, a standalone unbiased PEC tandem device comprising a CPF&#8208;TCzB/Sb2S3 photoanode and a back&#8208;illuminated Si photocathode can achieve a record solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 5.21%, representing the most efficient PEC water splitting device of its kind.

         <title>An Anode&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Graphite Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Zn&#8211;graphite battery in an anode&#8208;free configuration is demonstrated, which is enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping on a zincophilic Ag coating and anion intercalation&#8211;deintercalation. The constructed cell exhibits long cycling life of over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 82% and high specific energy of 79&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1.








Abstract
The anode&#8208;free battery concept is&#160;proposed to pursue the aspiration of energy&#8208;dense, rechargeable metal batteries, but this has not been achieved with dual&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, the first anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite battery enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping onto a silver&#8208;coated Cu substrate is demonstrated. The silver coating guides uniform Zn deposition without dendrite formation or side reaction over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations, enabling the construction of anode&#8208;free Zn cells. In addition, the graphite cathode operates efficiently under reversible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&#8722;) intercalation without anodic corrosion. An extra high&#8208;potential TFSI&#8722; intercalation plateau is recognized at 2.75&#160;V, contributing to the high capacity of graphite cathode. Thanks to efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping and TFSI&#8722; intercalation&#8211;deintercalation, an anode&#8208;free Zn&#8211;graphite dual&#8208;ion battery that exhibits impressive cycling stability with 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles is constructed. At the same time, a specific energy of 79&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 based on the mass of cathode and electrolyte is achieved, which is over two times higher than conventional Zn&#8211;graphite batteries (&lt;30&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1).

&lt;p&gt;A Zn&#8211;graphite battery in an anode-free configuration is demonstrated, which is enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping on a zincophilic Ag coating and anion intercalation&#8211;deintercalation. The constructed cell exhibits long cycling life of over 1000 cycles with a capacity retention of 82% and high specific energy of 79&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The anode-free battery concept is&#160;proposed to pursue the aspiration of energy-dense, rechargeable metal batteries, but this has not been achieved with dual-ion batteries. Herein, the first anode-free Zn&#8211;graphite battery enabled by efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping onto a silver-coated Cu substrate is demonstrated. The silver coating guides uniform Zn deposition without dendrite formation or side reaction over a wide range of electrolyte concentrations, enabling the construction of anode-free Zn cells. In addition, the graphite cathode operates efficiently under reversible bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anion (TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;) intercalation without anodic corrosion. An extra high-potential TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation plateau is recognized at 2.75&#160;V, contributing to the high capacity of graphite cathode. Thanks to efficient Zn plating&#8211;stripping and TFSI&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; intercalation&#8211;deintercalation, an anode-free Zn&#8211;graphite dual-ion battery that exhibits impressive cycling stability with 82% capacity retention after 1000 cycles is constructed. At the same time, a specific energy of 79&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; based on the mass of cathode and electrolyte is achieved, which is over two times higher than conventional Zn&#8211;graphite batteries (&amp;lt;30&#160;Wh&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conductive Ink with Circular Life Cycle for Printed Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The recyclability and sustainability of printed electronics have important design aspects in reducing the costs and environmental burden of electronic waste. Enzymatic degradation can be considered, but resource&#8208;intensive purification of enzymes limits scalability, and their stability is uncertain under electrical voltage and long&#8208;term storage. By employing a customized enzyme protectant, the ink can be disintegrated and recycled in warm water.








Abstract
Electronic waste carries energetic costs and an environmental burden rivaling that of plastic waste due to the rarity and toxicity of the heavy&#8208;metal components. Recyclable conductive composites are introduced for printed circuits formulated with polycaprolactone (PCL), conductive fillers, and enzyme/protectant nanoclusters. Circuits can be printed with flexibility (breaking strain &#8776;80%) and conductivity (&#8776;2.1&#160;&#215; 104 S m&#8722;1). These composites are degraded at the end of life by immersion in warm water with programmable latency. Approximately 94% of the functional fillers can be recycled and reused with similar device performance. The printed circuits remain functional and degradable after shelf storage for at least 7 months at room temperature and one month of continuous operation under electrical voltage. The present studies provide composite design toward recyclable and easily disposable printed electronics for applications such as wearable electronics, biosensors, and soft robotics.

         <title>Machine Learning on a Robotic Platform for the Design of Polymer&#8211;Protein Hybrids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polymer&#8211;protein hybrids (PPHs) offer new opportunities for protein stabilization in industrial and medical applications. Utilizing a combination of automated polymer synthesis and active machine learning, a Learn&#8211;Design&#8211;Test&#8211;Build strategy for protein&#8208;tailored copolymer design and synthesis is reported. The structure&#8211;function relationships within PPHs are probed using generated experimental data, and biophysical characterization is performed to elucidate potential mechanisms of stability within PPHs.








Abstract
Polymer&#8211;protein hybrids are intriguing materials that can bolster protein stability in non&#8208;native environments, thereby enhancing their utility in diverse medicinal, commercial, and industrial applications. One stabilization strategy involves designing synthetic random copolymers with compositions attuned to the protein surface, but rational design is complicated by the vast chemical and composition space. Here, a strategy is reported to design protein&#8208;stabilizing copolymers based on active machine learning, facilitated by automated material synthesis and characterization platforms. The versatility and robustness of the approach is demonstrated by the successful identification of copolymers that preserve, or even enhance, the activity of three chemically distinct enzymes following exposure to thermal denaturing conditions. Although systematic screening results in mixed success, active learning appropriately identifies unique and effective copolymer chemistries for the stabilization of each enzyme. Overall, this work broadens the capabilities to design fit&#8208;for&#8208;purpose synthetic copolymers that promote or otherwise manipulate protein activity, with extensions toward the design of robust polymer&#8211;protein hybrid&#160;materials.

         <title>Light Emission of Self&#8208;Trapped Excitons in Inorganic Metal Halides for Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Their fundamental emission mechanism endows self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton (STE)&#8208;emission metal halides with unique optoelectronic properties and broad applications. Recent progress on STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications, and the mechanisms&#8211;compositions&#8211;application relationships are systematically discussed. Current existing challenges and possible development opportunities are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Self&#8208;trapped excitons (STEs) have recently attracted tremendous interest due to their broadband emission, high photoluminescence quantum yield, and self&#8208;absorption&#8208;free properties, which enable a large range of optoelectronic applications such as lighting, displays, radiation detection, and special sensors. Unlike free excitons, the formation of STEs requires strong coupling between excited state excitons and the soft lattice in low electronic dimensional materials. The chemical and structural diversity of metal halides provides an ideal platform for developing efficient STE emission materials. Herein, an overview of recent progress on STE emission materials for optoelectronic applications is presented. The relationships between the fundamental emission mechanisms, chemical compositions, and device performances are systematically reviewed. On this basis, currently existing challenges and possible development opportunities in this field are presented.

         <title>Giant Negative Magnetoresistance beyond Chiral Anomaly in Topological Material YCuAs2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A giant negative magnetoresistance (MR) is reported in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2. The origin of the negative MR (&#8776;40%) is beyond the &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; mechanism and identified as vacancy&#8208;induced spin&#8208;dependent scattering. This finding suggests a unique way to introduce negative MR in nonmagnetic topological materials through defect engineering.








Abstract
The large negative magnetoresistance (MR) effect, which usually emerges in various magnetic systems, is a technologically important property for spintronics. Recently, the so&#8208;called &#8220;chiral anomaly&#8221; in topological semimetals offers an alternative to generate a considerable negative MR effect without utilizing magnetism. However, it requires that the applied magnetic field must be strictly along the electric current direction, which sets a strong limit for practical applications. Here, a giant negative MR effect is discovered with a value of up to &#8722;40% in 9 T at 2 K in the nonmagnetic Dirac material YCuAs2, which is not restricted to the specific configuration for applied magnetic fields. Based on magnetic susceptibility and NMR measurements, the giant negative MR effect is tightly connected with the unexpected spin&#8208;dependent scattering from vacancy&#8208;induced local moments, which is also beyond the classical Kondo effect. The present work not only offers an alternative route for spintronics based on nonmagnetic topological materials, but also helps to further understand the negative MR effect in topological materials.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Photothermally Triggered &#8220;Oxygen Bomb&#8221; for Hypoxic Tumor Programmed Cascade Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To obtain a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) photothermally triggered oxygen release vehicle PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D for hypoxic tumor treatment, NIR&#8208;II extinction photothermal&#8208;agent gold nanorods are fabricated on the surface of an oxygenated polymer nanocapsule through an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth strategy. Under a customized programmed cascade therapy, superior hypoxic tumor suppression is achieved under mild conditions.








Abstract
Hypoxia, as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) is reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near&#8208;infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods with excellent photo&#8208;to&#8208;heat energy&#8208;conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of the polymer shell via an innovative modified two&#8208;step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O2&#160;release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. First, PSPP&#8208;Au980&#8208;D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O2&#160;infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is used to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT.

&lt;p&gt;To obtain a second near-infrared (NIR-II) photothermally triggered oxygen release vehicle PSPP-Au&lt;sub&gt;980&lt;/sub&gt;-D for hypoxic tumor treatment, NIR-II extinction photothermal-agent gold nanorods are fabricated on the surface of an oxygenated polymer nanocapsule through an innovative modified two-step seedless ex situ growth strategy. Under a customized programmed cascade therapy, superior hypoxic tumor suppression is achieved under mild conditions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hypoxia, as a characteristic feature of solid tumors, has a close relationship with tumor resistance to photodynamic therapy (PDT) and chemotherapy. Perfluorocarbon (PFC) is reported to relieve hypoxic in solid tumors by acting as an oxygen carrier via several nanostructures. However, the oxygen delivery process is mostly driven by a concentration gradient, which is uncontrollable. Herein, a photothermally controlled &#8220;oxygen bomb&#8221; PSPP-Au&lt;sub&gt;980&lt;/sub&gt;-D is designed by encapsulating a PFC core within a functionalized bilayer polymer shell. Near-infrared second window photothermal agent gold nanorods with excellent photo-to-heat energy-conversion ability are fabricated on the surface of the polymer shell via an innovative modified two-step seedless ex situ growth process to thermally trigger O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;release. Then, a programmed cascade therapy strategy is customized for hypoxic orthotopic pancreatic cancer. First, PSPP-Au&lt;sub&gt;980&lt;/sub&gt;-D is irradiated by a 980&#160;nm laser to photothermally trigger O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;infusing into the hypoxic tumor microenvironment, which is accompanied by local hyperemia and doxorubicin release. Subsequently, a 680&#160;nm laser is used to generate singlet oxygen in the oxygenated tumor microenvironment for PDT. This choreographed programmed cascade therapy strategy will provide a new route for suppressing hypoxic tumor growth under mild conditions based on controllable and effective oxygen release.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Engineering a Kesterite&#8208;Based Photocathode for Photoelectrochemical Ammonia Synthesis from NOx Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rationally designed defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a kesterite&#8208;based photocathode (CdS/Cu2ZnSnS4) for selective photoelectrochemical ammonia synthesis directly from NOx reduction is established. Synergistically outstanding light&#8208;absorption capability, efficient photogenerated charge transfer, and selective surface catalytic reaction are successfully unified, contributing to maximum 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (at 0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode) toward ammonia.








Abstract
Ammonia is a key chemical feedstock for industry as well as future carbon&#8208;free fuel and transportable vector for renewable energy. Photoelectrochemical (PEC) ammonia synthesis from NOx reduction reaction (NOxRR) provides not only a promising alternative to the energy&#8208;intensive Haber&#8211;Bosch process through direct solar&#8208;to&#8208;ammonia conversion, but a sustainable solution for balancing the global nitrogen cycle by restoring ammonia from wastewater. In this work, selective ammonia synthesis from PEC NOxRR by a kesterite (Cu2ZnSnS4 [CZTS]) photocathode through loading defect&#8208;engineered TiOx cocatalyst on a CdS/CZTS photocathode (TiOx/CdS/CZTS) is demonstrated. The uniquely designed photocathode enables selective ammonia production from NOxRR, yielding up to 89.1% Faradaic efficiency (FE) (0.1&#160;V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE)) with a remarkable positive onset potential (0.38&#160;V vs RHE). By tailoring the amount of surface defective Ti3+ species, the adsorption of reactant NO3&#8722; and *NO2&#160;intermediate is significantly promoted while the full coverage of TiOx also suppresses NO2&#8722; liberation as a by&#8208;product, contributing to high ammonia selectivity. Further attempts on PEC ammonia synthesis from simulated wastewater show good FE of 64.9%, unveiling the potential of using the kesterite&#8208;based photocathode for sustainably restoring ammonia from nitrate&#8208;rich wastewater.

         <title>Defect&#8208;rich Molybdenum Sulfide Quantum Dots for Amplified Photoluminescence and Photonics Driven Reactive Oxygen Species Generation</title>

Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) quantum dots (QDs) with defects have attracted interesting chemistry due to contribution of vacancy to their unique optical, physical, catalytic and electrical properties. Engineering defined defects into molybdenum sulfide (MoS2) QDs is challenging. Herein, applying a mild biomineralization assisted bottom&#8208;up strategy fabricated blue photoluminescent MoS2 QDs (B&#8208;QDs) with a high density of defects. Our two stage synthesis begins with a bottom up synthesis of origin MoS2 QDs (O&#8208;QDs) through chemical reactions of Mo and sulfide ions, followed by alkaline etching that created high sulfur vacancy defects to eventually form B&#8208;QDs. Alkaline etching significantly increased the photoluminescence (PL) and photo&#8208;oxidation. We showed an increase in defect density brought about increased active sites and decreased bandgap energy; further validated with density functional theory calculations. There was strengthened binding affinity between QDs and O2 due to lower gap energy (&#8710;EST) between S1 and T1 accompanied with improved intersystem crossing (ISC) efficiency. Lowered gap energy contributed to assist e&#8722;&#8208;h+ pair formation and the strengthened binding affinity between QDs and 3O2. Defect engineering unraveled another dimension of material properties control and can bring fresh new applications to otherwise well characterized TMD nanomaterials.

         <title>Skin&#8208;inspired design integrates mechano&#8208;chemical&#8208;thermal robustness into superhydrophobic coatings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Designing scalable coatings with a wide spectrum of functions such as liquid repellency, anti&#8208;corrosion and anti&#8208;flaming and a high level of mechano&#8208;chemical&#8208;thermal robustness is crucial in real life applications. However, these individual functionalities and robustness are coupled together or even have conflicting requirements on the interfacial or bulky properties of materials, and thus simultaneously integrating all these individual features into one coating has proved challenging. Herein, we propose an integral skin&#8208;inspired triple&#8208;layered coating (STC) that resolves conflicting demands imposed by individual features on the structural, chemical, mechanical, and thermal properties of materials. Specifically, the rational design of multiple gradients in roughness, wetting, strength and flame retardancy and the formation of continuous interfaces along its triple layers endow a sustained liquid repellency, anti&#8208;corrosion and flame retardancy even under harsh environments, as well as strong anti&#8208;abrasion on surfaces and adhesion with substrate. Such an all&#8208;in&#8208;one design enhances the durability and lifetime of coatings and reduces the maintenance and repair, thereby contributing to cost and energy saving. Together with facile spraying fabrication process, our STC provides a feasible and sustainable strategy for constructing energy and resource&#8208;saving materials.

         <title>Sugar&#8208;derived Isotropic Nanoscale Polycrystalline Graphite Capable of Considerable Plastic Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Obtaining large plastic deformation in polycrystalline van der Waals (vdW) materials is challenging. Achieving such deformation is especially difficult in graphite because it is highly anisotropic. Hence, this study discusses the development of sugar&#8208;derived isotropic nanostructured polycrystalline graphite (SINPG). The structure of this material preserves the high in&#8208;plane rigidity and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane flexibility of graphene layers, and enables prominent plasticity by activating the rotation of nanoscale (5&#8211;10&#160;nm) grains. Thus, micrometer&#8208;sized SINPG samples demonstrate enhanced compressive strengths of up to 3.0&#160;GPa, and plastic strains of 30&#8211;50%. These findings suggest a new pathway for enabling plastic deformation in otherwise brittle vdW materials. This new class of nanostructured carbon materials is suitable for use in a broad range of fields, from semiconductor to aerospace applications.

         <dc:description>
Over the last 30 years, studies of epitaxial thin&#8208;film ferroelectrics have driven advances in the synthesis, characterization, and understanding of ferroelectric polarization, realizing new ferroelectric order, ferroelectric materials, and applications. A broad look at the field of thin&#8208;film ferroelectrics is provided, connecting early questions motivating researchers to open questions for the coming decades.








Abstract
Over the last 30 years, the study of ferroelectric oxides has been revolutionized by the implementation of epitaxial&#8208;thin&#8208;film&#8208;based studies, which have driven many advances in the understanding of ferroelectric physics and the realization of novel polar structures and functionalities. New questions have motivated the development of advanced synthesis, characterization, and simulations of epitaxial thin films and, in turn, have provided new insights and applications across the micro&#8208;, meso&#8208;, and macroscopic length scales. This review traces the evolution of ferroelectric thin&#8208;film research through the early days developing understanding of the roles of size and strain on ferroelectrics to the present day, where such understanding is used to create complex hierarchical domain structures, novel polar topologies, and controlled chemical and defect profiles. The extension of epitaxial techniques, coupled with advances in high&#8208;throughput simulations, now stands to accelerate the discovery and study of new ferroelectric materials. Coming hand&#8208;in&#8208;hand with these new materials is new understanding and control of ferroelectric functionalities. Today, researchers are actively working to apply these lessons in a number of applications, including novel memory and logic architectures, as well as a host of energy conversion devices.

         <title>Synergistic Cr2O3@Ag Heterostructure Enhanced Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to CO</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3@Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst exhibits superb selectivity, activity, and stability toward CO2 reduction to CO, resulting from the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic CO2RR to produce value&#8208;added chemicals and fuels has been recognized as a promising means to reduce the reliance on fossil resources; it is, however, hindered due to the lack of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts. The effectiveness of sculpturing metal/metal oxides (MMO) heterostructures to enhance electrocatalytic performance toward CO2RR has been well documented, nonetheless, the precise synergistic mechanism of MMO remains elusive. Herein, an in operando electrochemically synthesized Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure electrocatalyst (Cr2O3@Ag) is reported for efficient electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to CO. The obtained Cr2O3@Ag can readily achieve a superb FECO of 99.6% at &#8722;0.8&#160;V (vs RHE) with a high JCO of 19.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. These studies also confirm that the operando synthesized Cr2O3@Ag possesses high operational stability. Notably, operando Raman spectroscopy studies reveal that the markedly enhanced performance is attributable to the synergistic Cr2O3&#8211;Ag heterostructure induced stabilization of CO2&#8226;&#8722;/*COOH intermediates. DFT calculations unveil that the metallic&#8208;Ag&#8208;catalyzed CO2 reduction to CO requires a 1.45&#160;eV energy input to proceed, which is 0.93&#160;eV higher than that of the MMO&#8208;structured Cr2O3@Ag. The exemplified approaches in this work would be adoptable for design and development of high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for other important reactions.

         <title>Nanoscale Antiferromagnetic Domain Imaging using Full&#8208;Field Resonant X&#8208;ray Magnetic Diffraction Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;field resonant X&#8208;ray magnetic diffraction microscopy enables nanoscale antiferromagnetic domain imaging of large&#8208;area bulk single crystals with very high spatial resolution (&#8776;150 nm) and high throughput. This novel technique visualizes antiferromagnetic domain walls and uncovers hitherto unknown mesoscopic antiferromagnetic structures in the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4.








Abstract
The physical properties of magnetic materials frequently depend not only on the microscopic spin and electronic structures, but also on the structures of mesoscopic length scales that emerge, for instance, from domain formations, or chemical and/or electronic phase separations. However, experimental access to such mesoscopic structures is currently limited, especially for antiferromagnets with net zero magnetization. Here, full&#8208;field microscopy and resonant magnetic X&#8208;ray diffraction are combined to visualize antiferromagnetic (AF) domains of the spin&#8211;orbit Mott insulator Sr2IrO4 with area over &#8776;0.1 mm2 and with spatial resolution as high as &#8776;150&#160;nm. With the unprecedented wide field of views and high spatial resolution, an intertwining of two AF domains on a length comparable to the measured average AF domain wall width of 545&#160;nm is revealed. This mesoscopic structure comprises a substantial portion of the sample surface, and thus can result in a macroscopic response, which is unexpected from its microscopic magnetic structure. In particular, this symmetry analysis shows that the inversion symmetry, which is preserved by the microscopic AF order, becomes ill&#8208;defined at the mesoscopic length scale. This result underscores the importance of this novel technique for a thorough understanding of the physical properties of antiferromagnets.

Chemical instability within conventional hybrid perovskites is addressed using inorganic CsPbI3&#8208;based systems. A novel &#947;&#8208;CsPb1&#8722;xTbx(IBr)3 perovskite is fabricated with the help of bulk and surface passivation methods, the combination of which ensures ambient&#8208;processed and stable inorganic lead halide perovskite solar cells that produce 19% power conversion efficiency with &gt;90%&#160;thermal&#8208;stability over 300 h at 85&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Realizing photoactive and thermodynamically stable all&#8208;inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) remains a challenging task within halide perovskite photovoltaic (PV) research. Here, a dual strategy for realizing efficient inorganic mixed halide perovskite PV devices based on a terbium&#8208;doped solar absorber, that is, CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br, is reported, which undertakes a bulk and surface passivation treatment in the form of CsPb1&#8722;xTbxI2Br quantum dots, to maintain a photoactive &#947;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions and with significantly improved operational stability. Devices fabricated from these air&#8208;processed perovskite thin films exhibit an air&#8208;stable power conversion efficiency (PCE) that reaches 17.51% (small&#8208;area devices) with negligible hysteresis and maintains &gt;90%&#160;of the initial efficiency when operating for 600 h under harsh environmental conditions, stemming from the combined effects of the dual&#8208;protection strategy. This approach is further examined within large&#8208;area PSC modules (19.8 cm2 active area) to realize 10.94% PCE and &gt;30&#160;days ambient stability, as well as within low&#8208;bandgap &#947;&#8208;CsPb0.95Tb0.05I2.5Br0.5 (Eg&#160;= 1.73&#160;eV) materials, yielding 19.01% (18.43% certified) PCE.

         <dc:description>
A multifunctional sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA) binder is developed, which shows enhanced ionic conductivity and electrochemical stability. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase to help stabilize the cathode electrolyte interface, protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling.








Abstract
The multiple issues of unstable electrode/electrolyte interphases, sluggish reaction kinetics, and transition&#8208;metal (TM) dissolution have long greatly affected the rate and cycling performance of cathode materials for Na&#8208;ion batteries. Herein, a multifunctional protein&#8208;based binder, sericin protein/poly(acrylic acid) (SP/PAA), is developed, which shows intriguing physiochemical properties to address these issues. The highly hydrophilic nature and strong H&#8208;bond interaction between crosslinking SP and PAA leads to a uniform coating of the binder layer, which serves as an artificial interphase on the high&#8208;voltage Na4Mn2Fe(PO4)2P2O7 cathode material (NMFPP). Through systematic experiments and theoretical calculations, it is shown that the SP/PAA binder is electrochemically stable at high voltages and possesses increased ionic conductivity due to the interaction between sericin and electrolyte anion ClO4&#8722;, which can provide additional sodium&#8208;migration paths with greatly reduced energy barriers. Besides, the strong interaction force between the binder and the NMFPP can effectively protect the cathode from electrolyte corrosion, suppress Mn&#8208;dissolution, stabilize crystal structure, and ensure electrode integrity during cycling. Benefiting from these merits, the SP/PAA&#8208;based NMFPP electrode displays enhanced rate and cycling performance. Of note, the universality of the SP/PAA binder is further confirmed on Na3V2(PO4)2F3. It is believed that the versatile protein&#8208;based binder is enlightening for the development of high&#8208;performance batteries.

Abstract
Information security protection has a tremendous impact on human life, social stability, and national security, leading to the rapid development of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials and related techniques. However, the traditional stored information on hard or dry media is often static and lacks functions, which makes it challenging to deal with increasing and powerful counterfeiting technologies. Modified intelligent polymeric gels exhibit color changes and shape morphing under external stimuli, which give them great potential for applications in information storage. This paper provides an overview of the latest progress in polymeric gel&#8208;based information storage materials in relation to counterfeiting. Following a brief introduction of anti&#8208;counterfeiting materials, the preparation methods for intelligent gels with adjustable colors (e.g., chemical colors and physical colors) and various encryption/decryption modes involving dimensions and diverse colors are outlined. Finally, the challenges and prospects for information storage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting based on smart gels are discussed.

         <title>Accessing Excitation&#8208; and Time&#8208;Responsive Afterglows from Aqueous Processable Amorphous Polymer Films through Doping and Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Smart afterglow materials in response to excitation and delay time, including crystals, polymeric films, and carbon dots, have attracted considerable attention on account of their fundamental value in photophysics and promising applications in optoelectronics. However, the fabrication of amorphous and flexible polymer films with fine control remains underexplored. Herein, we developed new doped polymer films based on sodium alginate and aromatic carboxylates, which demonstrate following advantages of: (i) easy and fast fabrication through the aqueous solution process, (ii) flexible, transparent, and re&#8208;dissolvable, (iii) multi&#8208;tunable afterglow colors from blue to red and even white with fine control. Specifically, even better controllability can be achieved through co&#8208;doping and triplet to singlet F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer (TS&#8208;FRET). Multimode advanced anticounterfeiting of these materials is demonstrated using their excitation&#8208; and time&#8208;dependent as well as TS&#8208;FRET mediated afterglow colors.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Dependent Enzyme Mimicking Activity and Radiosensitizing Effect of Bimetallic Clusters to Modulate Tumor Hypoxia for Enhanced Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Alloying is an efficient chemistry to tailor the properties of metal clusters. As a class of promising radiosensitizers, most previously reported metal clusters exhibit unitary function and could not overcome radioresistance of hypoxic tumors. Here, we synthesize atomically precise alloy clusters Pt2M4 (M = Au, Ag, Cu) with bright luminescence and adequate biocompatibility, and explore their composition&#8208;dependent enzyme mimicking activity and radiosensitizing effect. Specifically, only Pt2Au4 cluster display catalase&#8208;like activity while the others did not have clusterzyme properties, and its radiosensitizing effect is the highest among all the alloy clusters tested. By taking advantage of the sustainable production of O2 via the decomposition of endogenous H2O2, Pt2Au4 cluster modulate tumor hypoxia as well as increased the efficacy of radiotherapy. This work thus advances a cluster alloying strategy to produce multifunctional therapeutic agents for improving hypoxic tumor therapy.

         <title>Drug in Drug: A host&#8211;guest formulation of azocalixarene with hydroxychloroquine for synergistic anti&#8208;inflammation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Macrocyclic delivery and therapeutics are two significant topics in supramolecular biomedicine. The functional integration of these topics would open new avenues for treating diseases synergistically. However, these two individual topics have been occasionally merged, probably because of the lack of functionalized design of macrocyclic host and the lack of efficient recognition between host and guest drugs. Herein, we proposed a &#8220;drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug&#8221; strategy in which an active drug is encapsulated by a macrocycle possessing therapeutic activity to form a multi&#8208;functional supramolecular active pharmaceutical ingredient. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we prepared a complex of hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) with sulfonated azocalix[4]arene (HCQ@SAC4A) to treat rheumatoid arthritis (RA) combinedly. SAC4A is a therapeutic agent that exhibits scavenging capacity for reactive oxygen species and exerts an anti&#8208;inflammatory effect. It is also a hypoxia&#8208;responsive carrier that could deliver HCQ directly to the inflammatory articular cavity. Consequently, HCQ@SAC4A achieved the synergistic anti&#8208;inflammatory effect on both inflamed RAW 264.7 cells and RA rats. This effect is attributed to the temporal and spatial consistency of the two active ingredients of the complex. As a new paradigm for combinational therapy, the drug&#8208;in&#8208;drug strategy advances in easy preparation, mix&#8208;and&#8208;match combination, and precise ratiometric control.

         <title>Roles of MXene in Pressure Sensing: Preparation, Composite Structure Design, and Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D layered nanosheet MXene has been widely studied in pressure sensing due to the excellent mechanical and electrical properties, outstanding hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. To further promote the application of MXene in pressure sensors, the preparation of MXene, MXene&#8208;based microstructures, MXene pressure&#8208;sensor mechanisms, and the integration of multiple devices are reviewed.








Abstract
Flexible pressure sensors are one of the most important components in the fields of electronic skin (e&#8208;skin), robotics, and health monitoring. However, the application of pressure sensors in practice is still difficult and expensive due to the limited sensing properties and complex manufacturing process. The emergence of MXene, a red&#8208;hot member of the 2D nanomaterials, has brought a brand&#8208;new breakthrough for pressure sensing. Ti3C2Tx is the most popular studied MXene in the field of pressure sensing and shows good mechanical, electrical properties, excellent hydrophilicity, and extensive modifiability. It will ameliorate the properties of the sensitive layer and electrode layer of the pressure sensor, and further apply pressure sensing to many fields, such as e&#8208;skin flexibility. Herein, the preparation technologies, antioxidant methods, and properties of MXene are summarized. The design of MXene&#8208;based microstructures is introduced, including hydrogels, aerogels, foam, fabrics, and composite nanofibers. The mechanisms of MXene pressure sensors are further broached, including piezoresistive, capacitive, piezoelectric, triboelectric, and potentiometric transduction mechanism. Moreover, the integration of multiple devices is reviewed. Finally, the chance and challenge of pressure sensors improved by MXene smart materials in future e&#8208;skin and the Internet of Things are prospected.

         <title>Snakeskin&#8208;inspired, Soft&#8208;Hinge Kirigami Metamaterial for Self&#8208;adaptive Conformal Electronic Armor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
A majority of soft&#8208;body creatures evolve armors or shells to protect themselves. Similar protection demand is for flexible electronics working in complex environments. Existing works mainly focus on improving the sensing capabilities such as electronic skin (E&#8208;skin). Inspired by snakeskin, here we&#160;propose a novel electronic armor (E&#8208;armor), which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E&#8208;skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of Kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri&#8208;MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection. Moreover, to suppress the inherent but undesired out&#8208;of&#8208;plane buckling of conventional Kiri&#8208;MMs for conformal applications, soft hinges are used to form a distinct soft (hinges)&#8208;rigid (tiles) configuration. Analytical, computational, and experimental studies of the mechanical behaviors of soft&#8208;hinge Kiri&#8208;MM E&#8208;armor demonstrate the merits of this design, i.e., stretchability, conformability, and protectability, as applied to flexible electronics. Deploying conductive soft material at the hinges enables facile wiring strategies for large&#8208;scale circuit arrays. Functional E&#8208;armor systems for controllable display and sensing purposes provide simple examples of a wide spectrum of applications of this concept.

Inspired by snakeskin, here we&#160;propose a novel electronic armor (E-armor), which not only possesses mechanical flexibility and electronic functions similar to E-skin, but is also able to protect itself and the underlying soft body from external physical damage. The geometry of Kirigami mechanical metamaterial (Kiri-MM) ensures auxetic stretchability and meanwhile large areal coverage for sufficient protection.

         <title>Topological Crystalline Insulator Candidate ErAsS with Hourglass Fermion and Magnetic&#8208;tuned Topological Phase Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) with hourglass fermion surface state have attracted a lot of attention and are further enriched by crystalline symmetries and magnetic order. Here, we show the emergence of hourglass fermion surface state and exotic phases in the newly discovered, air&#8208;stable ErAsS single crystals. In the paramagnetic phase, ErAsS is expected to be a TCI with hourglass fermion surface state protected by the nonsymmorphic symmetry. Dirac&#8208;cone like bands and nearly linear dispersions in large energy range are experimentally observed, consistent well with theoretical calculations. Below TN &#8764; 3.27 K, ErAsS enters a collinear antiferromagnetic state, which is a trivial insulator breaking the time&#8208;reversal symmetry. An intermediate incommensurate magnetic state appears in a narrow temperature range (3.27 K &#8211; 3.65 K), exhibiting an abrupt change in magnetic coupling. The results reveal that ErAsS is an experimentally available TCI candidate and provide a unique platform to understand the formation of hourglass fermion surface state and explore magnetic&#8208;tuned topological phase transitions.

         <title>Dendrite&#8208;free and long&#8208;cycling Lithium Metal Battery Enabled by Ultrathin, 2D shield&#8208;defensive, and Single lithium&#8208;ion Conducting Polymeric Membrane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polymeric membranes are considered as promising materials to realize safe and long&#8208;life lithium metal batteries (LMBs). However, they are usually based on soft one&#8208;dimensional (1D) linear polymers and thus cannot effectively inhibit piercing of lithium dendrites at high current density. Herein, we successfully design and fabricate single lithium&#8208;ion conducting molecular brushes (GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi) with a new two&#8208;dimensional (2D) &#8220;soft&#8208;hard&#8208;soft&#8221; hierarchical structure by grafting hairy lithium polystyrenesulfonate (PSSLi) chains on both sides of graphene oxide (GO) sheets. We further construct ultrathin GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane by evaporation&#8208;induced layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly of GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi molecular brushes. Unlike conventional soft 1D linear polymeric structure, the rigid 2D extended aromatic structure of intralayer GO backbones can bear the shield effect of preventing the dendrites possibly generated at high current density from piercing. More importantly, such a shield effect could be significantly strengthened by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacking of 2D molecular brushes. On the other hand, the 3D interconnected interlayer channels and the soft single lithium&#8208;ion conducting PSSLi side&#8208;chains on the surface of channels provide rapid lithium&#8208;ion transportation pathways and homogenize lithium&#8208;ion fluxes. As a result, LMBs with GO&#8208;g&#8208;PSSLi membrane possess long&#8208;term reversible lithium plating/striping (6 months) at high current density.

         <title>Integrating SEI into Layered Conductive Polymer Coatings for Ultra&#8208;stable Silicon Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tackling the huge volume expansion of silicon (Si) anode desires a stable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) to prohibit the interfacial side reactions. Here, we build a layered conductive polyaniline (named as LCP) coating on Si nanoparticles to achieve high areal capacity and long lifespan. The conformal LCP coating stores electrolyte in interlamination spaces and directs an in&#8208;situ formation of LCP&#8208;integrated hybrid SEI skin with uniform distribution of organic and inorganic components, enhancing the flexibility of SEI to buffer the volume changes and maintaining homogeneous ion transport during cycling. As a result, the Si anode shows a remarkable cycling stability under high areal capacity (&#8764; 3 mAh cm&#8211;2) after 150 cycles and good rate performance of 942 mAh g&#8211;1 at 5 A g&#8211;1. This work demonstrates great potential of regulating the SEI properties by layered polymer&#8208;directing SEI formation for the mechanical and electrochemical stabilization of Si anodes.

         <title>Stable and Bright Electroluminescent Devices Utilizing Emissive 0D Perovskite Nanocrystals Incorporated in a 3D CsPbBr3 Matrix</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The zero&#8208;dimensional (0D) cesium lead halide perovskite Cs4PbBr6 has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its three&#8208;dimensional (3D) CsPbBr3 counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light&#8208;emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs4PbBr6 has been employed only as a higher&#8208;bandgap non&#8208;luminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr3 in light&#8208;emitting devices and to enhance its photo/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, we designed a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs4PbBr6 nanocrystals (PNCs) into a 3D CsPbBr3 film, forming the active emissive layer in single&#8208;layer perovskite light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs). We observed a dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for a 3D&#8208;0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs. The majority of this increase is driven by efficient inherent emission of 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half&#8208;life of 129 h), making this one of the best performing LECs reported to date.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The zero-dimensional (0D) cesium lead halide perovskite Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has drawn remarkable interest due to its highly efficient robust green emission compared to its three-dimensional (3D) CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; counterpart. However, seizing the advantages of the superior photoluminescence properties for practical light-emitting devices remains elusive. To date, Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; has been employed only as a higher-bandgap non-luminescent matrix to passivate or provide quantum/dielectric confinement to CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; in light-emitting devices and to enhance its photo/thermal/environmental stability. To resolve this disparity, we designed a novel solvent engineering method to incorporate highly luminescent 0D Cs&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;PbBr&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nanocrystals (PNCs) into a 3D CsPbBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; film, forming the active emissive layer in single-layer perovskite light-emitting electrochemical cells (PeLECs). We observed a dramatic increase of the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) and luminance from 2.7% and 6050&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a 3D-only PeLEC to 8.3% and 11&#8239;200&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for a 3D-0D PNC device with only 7% by weight of 0D PNCs. The majority of this increase is driven by efficient inherent emission of 0D PNCs, while the concomitant morphology improvement also contributes to reduced leakage current, reduced hysteresis, and enhanced operational lifetime (half-life of 129 h), making this one of the best performing LECs reported to date.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Single&#8208;atom catalysts have emerged as an efficient oxidant activator for eliminating organic pollutants in Fenton&#8208;like systems. However, the complex preparation, single active site, lack of fundamental mechanism understanding, and harsh pH conditions currently limit their practical applications. In this work, single&#8208;atom iron anchored nitrogen&#8208;rich g&#8208;C3N4 nanotubes (FeCN) were designed and synthesized by a facile approach, and an eco&#8208;friendly peracetic acid (PAA) was selected as the oxidant for Fenton&#8208;like reactions. The constructed heterogeneous system achieves an enhanced degradation of various organic contaminants over a wide pH range of 3.0&#8208;9.0, exhibiting an ultrahigh and stable catalytic activity. This performance outperforms equivalent quantities of pristine g&#8208;C3N4 by 75 times. The 18O isotope&#8208;labeling technique, probe method, and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the efficient catalytic activity relies on the high&#8208;valent iron&#8208;oxo species coupled with organic radicals generated by PAA. An increase in electron transport from the contaminant to the formed &#8220;metastable PAA/FeCN catalyst surface complex&#8221; was detected. A double driving mechanism for the tubular g&#8208;C3N4 regulated by a single Fe site and PAA activation was proposed. This work opens an avenue for developing novel catalysts with the coexistence of multiple active units and providing opportunities for significantly improving catalytic efficiency.

         <title>How to Change the Reaction Chemistry on Non&#8208;Precious Metal Oxide Nanostructure Materials for Electrocatalytic Oxidation of Biomass&#8208;Derived Glycerol to Renewable Chemicals?</title>

Abstract
Au and Pt are well&#8208;known catalysts for electrocatalytic oxidation of biomass&#8208;derived glycerol. Although some non&#8208;precious metal based materials to replace the costly Au and Pt have been used for this reaction, the fundamental question of how the non&#8208;precious catalysts affect the reaction chemistry and mechanism compared to Au and Pt catalysts is still unanswered. In this work, both experimental and computational methods are used to understand how and why the reaction performance and chemistry for the electrocatalytic glycerol oxidation reaction (EGOR) change with electrochemically&#8208;synthesized CuCo&#8208;oxide, Cu&#8208;oxide, and Co&#8208;oxide catalysts compared to conventional Au and Pt catalysts. The Au and Pt catalysts generated major glyceric acid and glycolic acid products from the EGOR. Interestingly, the prepared Cu based oxides produced glycolic acid and formic acid with high selectivity of about 90.0%. This different reaction chemistry was related to the enhanced ability of C&#8208;C bond cleavage on the Cu based oxide materials. Our density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the formic acids were mainly formed on the Cu based oxide surfaces rather than in the process of glycolic acid formation in the free energy diagram. This study provides critical scientific insights into developing future non&#8208;precious&#8208;based materials for electrochemical biomass conversions.

         <title>Current and Future Trends for Polymer Micro/Nanoprocessing in Industrial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development trends, and advantages and deficiencies of three processing methods: micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining (microcutting, micro/nanowelding, and LIGA) are systematically summarized, adding to the existing body of knowledge for employing appropriate polymer processing techniques in customized industrial applications.








Abstract
Polymers are widely used in optical devices, electronic devices, energy&#8208;harvesting/storage devices, and sensors, owing to their low weight, excellent flexibility, and simple fabrication process. With advancements in micro/nanoprocessing techniques and more demanding application requirements, it is becoming necessary to realize high&#8208;resolution fabrication of polymers to prepare miniaturized devices. This is particularly because conventional processing technologies suffer from high thermal stress and strong adhesion/friction, which can irreversibly damage the micro/nanostructures of miniaturized devices. In addition, although the use of advanced fabrication methods to prepare high&#8208;resolution micro/nanostructures is explored, these methods are limited to laboratory research or small&#8208;batch production. This review focuses on the micro/nanoprocessing of polymeric materials and devices with high spatial precision and replication accuracy for industrial applications. Specifically, the current state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art techniques and future trends for micro/nanomolding, high&#8208;energy beam processing, and micro/nanomachining are discussed. Moreover, an overview of the fabrication and applications of various polymer&#8208;based elements and devices such as microlenses, biosensors, and transistors is provided. These techniques are expected to be widely applied for multiscale and multimaterial processing as well as for multifunction integration in next&#8208;generation integrated devices, such as photoelectric, smart, and biodegradable devices.

Abstract
Disordered superconducting nitrides with kinetic inductance have long been considered to be leading material candidates for high&#8208;inductance quantum&#8208;circuit applications. Despite continuing efforts toward reducing material dimensions to increase the kinetic inductance and the corresponding circuit impedance, achieving further improvements without compromising material quality has become a fundamental challenge. To this end, we&#160;propose a method to drastically increase the kinetic inductance of superconducting materials via spinodal decomposition while maintaining a low microwave loss. we&#160;used epitaxial Ti0.48Al0.52N as a model system and for the first time demonstrated the utilization of spinodal decomposition to trigger the insulator&#8208;to&#8208;superconductor transition with a drastically enhanced material disorder. The measured kinetic inductance increased by 2&#8211;3 orders of magnitude compared with the best disordered superconducting nitrides reported to date. Our&#160;work paves the way for substantially enhancing and deterministically controlling the inductance for advanced superconducting quantum&#160;circuits.

         <title>Twisting Linear to Orbital Angular Momentum in an Ultrasonic Motor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compact ultrasonic motor built with a meta engine block that enables high&#8208;efficiency momentum twisting and contactless rotation of sound&#8208;absorbing objects is designed and experimentally demonstrated. Without dependence on multiple sources or geometric symmetry, this passive device deeply simplifies the orbital angular momentum production in 2D acoustic systems and offers new possibilities for the miniaturization and integration of vortex devices.








Abstract
An ultrasonic motor built with a contactless meta engine block (MEB) is designed and experimentally demonstrated for twisting the linear momentum of sound emanating from a Helmholtz resonator&#8208;based metasurface into orbital angular momentum (OAM). The MEB is capable of hosting highly efficient excitations of eigenmodes carrying desired OAM whose Bessel acoustic intensity patterns are enhanced by over ten times compared to the incident wave. Thanks to this efficiency, bidirectional ultrasonic OAM is capable of driving loads at speeds up to 1000&#160;rpm at 4 W and remarkable sound radiation torque levels. Moreover, the possibility of using arbitrarily shaped MEBs is also demonstrated by engineering its physical boundary condition based on an analytically derived criterion to guarantee the high twisting efficiency of man&#8208;made OAM. The results show how noninvasive driving of an ultrasonic motor can be made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.

The MEB is capable of hosting highly efficient excitations of eigenmodes carrying desired OAM whose Bessel acoustic intensity patterns are enhanced by over ten times compared to the incident wave. Thanks to this efficiency, bidirectional ultrasonic OAM is capable of driving loads at speeds up to 1000&#160;rpm at 4 W and remarkable sound radiation torque levels. Moreover, the possibility of using arbitrarily shaped MEBs is also demonstrated by engineering its physical boundary condition based on an analytically derived criterion to guarantee the high twisting efficiency of man-made OAM. The results show how noninvasive driving of an ultrasonic motor can be made possible through appropriately designed momentum twisting, which opens the door to a new class of integrated mechanical devices solely powered by sound.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Untangling the Mechanisms of Lattice Distortions in Biogenic Crystals across Scales</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy (DFXM) method is used to provide unprecedented information on large biogenic crystals across scales. Detailed analysis in 3D establishes correlations between local nanoscale lattice distortions, chemical composition, and the formation process of the biogenic crystal as a whole. Most importantly, it allows a number of mechanisms that drive the process of biomineral formation to be untangled.








Abstract
Biomineralized structures are complex functional hierarchical assemblies composed of biomineral building blocks joined together by an organic phase. The formation of individual mineral units is governed by the cellular tissue component that orchestrates the process of biomineral nucleation, growth, and morphogenesis. These processes are imprinted in the structural, compositional, and crystallographic properties of the emerging biominerals on all scales. Measurement of these properties can provide crucial information on the mechanisms that are employed by the organism to form these complex 3D architectures and to unravel principles of their functionality. Nevertheless, so far, this has only been possible at the macroscopic scale, by averaging the properties of the entire composite assembly, or at the mesoscale, by looking at extremely small parts of the entire picture. In this study, the newly developed synchrotron&#8208;based dark&#8208;field X&#8208;ray microscopy method is employed to study the link between 3D crystallographic properties of relatively large calcitic prisms in the shell of the mollusc Pinna nobilis and their local lattice properties with extremely high angular resolution down to 0.001&#176;. Mechanistic links between variations in local lattice parameters and spacing, crystal orientation, chemical composition, and the deposition process of the entire mineral unit are unraveled.

         <title>Spatial Distribution Control of Antimicrobial Peptides through a Novel Polymeric Carrier for Safe and Efficient Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polymeric antimicrobial peptides (AMP) carrier that can enhance anticancer efficacy and minimize the potential side effects of AMPs by finely controlling their spatial distribution is reported. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability.








Abstract
Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) hold great potential for use in tumor treatment. However, developing AMP&#8208;based antitumor therapies is challenging due to circulatory instability, hemolytic toxicity, low selectivity, and poor cell permeability of AMPs. In this study, a polymeric carrier for AMPs (denoted as PAMPm&#8208;co&#8208;PPBEn/PCA) is presented that effectively enhances their anticancer efficacy while minimizing their potential side effects. By integrating multiple responsive structures at the molecular level, the carrier finely controls the spatial distribution of AMPs in different biological microenvironments, thereby effectively modulating their membranolytic ability. Upon employing KLA as the model AMP, the polymeric carrier's hemolytic toxicity during blood circulation is suppressed, its cellular internalization when reaching tumor tissues facilitated, and its membranolytic toxicity toward the mitochondria upon entering cancer cells restored and further enhanced. Animal studies indicate that this approach significantly improves the antitumor efficacy of KLA and reduces its toxicity. Considering that the loading method for most AMPs is identical to that of KLA, the polymeric carrier reported in this study may provide a feasible approach for the development of AMP&#8208;based cancer treatments.

         <title>Pseudo&#8208;Planar Heterojunction Organic Photovoltaics with Optimized Light Utilization for Printable Solar Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction strategy is an efficient strategy to improving average visible transmittance (AVT) and power conversion efficiency (PCE) values of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) simultaneously due to the reduction of the optical loss, and the semitransparent devices afford a highest efficiency of 14.62% with a considerable AVT of 20.42%.








Abstract
The existing conformation of the active layer is defective for employment of semitransparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) in solar windows. Herein, scalable solar windows are successfully printed by introducing a pseudo&#8208;planar heterojunction (PPHJ) structure. The PPHJ structure can effectively improve the average visible transmittance (AVT) value while boosting the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of semitransparent devices due to the reduced optical loss. The universality of the PPHJ structure in the preparation of ST&#8208;OSCs is proved. Furthermore, an inset of a superhydrophobic patterned soft insertion layer (PSIL) in the encapsulated window improves the waterproof performance without losing transparency. Accordingly, the semitransparent devices based on the 2,2&#8242;&#8208;((2Z,2&#8242;Z)&#8208;((12,13&#8208;bis(2&#8208;ethylhexyl)&#8208;3,9&#8208;diundecyl&#8208;12,13&#8208;dihydro&#8208;[1,2,5]thiadiazolo[3,4&#8208;e]thieno[2&#8243;,3&#8243;:4&#8242;,5&#8242;]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]pyrrolo[3,2&#8208;g]thieno[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[3,2&#8208;b]indole&#8208;2,10&#8208;diyl)bis(methanylylidene))bis(5,6&#8208;difluoro&#8208;3&#8208;oxo&#8208;2,3&#8208;dihydro&#8208;1H&#8208;indene&#8208;2,1&#8208;diylidene))dimalononitrile (Y6) system afford a maximal efficiency of 14.62%, with a considerable AVT of 20.42%, and the resultant solar windows achieve a stabilized efficiency of 13.34% with excellent waterproof performance.

         <title>An On&#8208;Chip Liquid Metal Plug Generator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator is demonstrated. Reproducible liquid metal plugs of a given size are generated based on Laplace pressure tuning in constricted channels whereas plugs of varying sizes and interspacing are generated for modulated voltages in straight channels prefilled with 1 m NaOH. This device can be used to generate liquid metal plugs on demand directly on&#8208;chip.








Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal nonspherical droplets (plugs) have seen increasing demand recently mainly because their high aspect ratios make them beneficial for a wide range of applications, including microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), microfluidics, sensor technology, radio&#8208;frequency devices, actuators, and switches. However, reproducibility of the generation of such plugs, as well as precise control over their size, is yet challenging. In this work, a simple on&#8208;chip liquid metal plug generator using a commercially available 3D microprinter is presented and the plug generator in poly(dimethylsiloxane) is replicated via soft lithography. Liquid metal plugs are generated via a combination of electrochemical oxidation, design of well&#8208;defined constrictions based on Laplace pressure, and the application of modulated voltage control signals. It is shown that plugs of various aspect ratios can be generated reproducibly for channel widths of 0.5, 0.8, and 1.5&#160;mm with constriction widths of 0.1&#160;mm at 6&#160;V. Laplace&#8208;pressure&#8208;controlled plugs in constricted channels are compared to modulated&#8208;voltage&#8208;generated plugs in straight channels showing that this technique provides significantly enhanced reproducibility and control over the size and spacing between the plugs. This work paves the way to sub&#8208;millimeter liquid metal plugs generated directly on&#8208;chip for on&#8208;demand MEMS and microfluidic applications.

         <title>Automated Laser&#8208;Transfer Synthesis of High&#8208;Density Microarrays for Infectious Disease Screening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated laser&#8208;based synthesis machine is presented, combining laser&#8208;induced forward transfer and robotics to perform parallel chemistry in the microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. By developing an optimization pipeline, peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences can be synthesized in high yield to study the antibody responses in infectious disease patients.








Abstract
Laser&#8208;induced forward transfer (LIFT) is a rapid laser&#8208;patterning technique for high&#8208;throughput combinatorial synthesis directly on glass slides. A lack of automation and precision limits LIFT applications to simple proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept syntheses of fewer than 100 compounds. Here, an automated synthesis instrument is reported that combines laser transfer and robotics for parallel synthesis in a microarray format with up to 10&#8201;000 individual reactions cm&#8722;2. An optimized pipeline for amide bond formation is the basis for preparing complex peptide microarrays with thousands of different sequences in high yield with high reproducibility. The resulting peptide arrays are of higher quality than commercial peptide arrays. More than 4800 15&#8208;residue peptides resembling the entire Ebola virus proteome on a microarray are synthesized to study the antibody response of an Ebola virus infection survivor. Known and unknown epitopes that serve now as a basis for Ebola diagnostic development are identified. The versatility and precision of the synthesizer is demonstrated by in situ synthesis of fluorescent molecules via Schiff base reaction and multi&#8208;step patterning of precisely definable amounts of fluorophores. This automated laser transfer synthesis approach opens new avenues for high&#8208;throughput chemical synthesis and biological screening.

         <title>Crowning Lithium Ions in Hole&#8208;Transport Layer toward Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address the negative impacts of doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity and ion diffusion. Crowning Li+ ions in the hole&#8208;transporting layer enables perovskite solar cells with enhanced power conversion efficiency and significantly improves stability under humid and thermal conditions.








Abstract
State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite solar cells (PSCs) exhibit comparable power conversion efficiency (PCE) to that of silicon photovoltaic devices. However, the device stability remains a major obstacle that restricts widespread application. Doping&#8208;induced hygroscopicity, ion diffusion, and use of polar solvents in the hole&#8208;transport layer are detrimental factors for performance degradation of PSCs. Here, phase&#8208;transfer&#8208;catalyzed LiTFSI doping in Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD is developed to address these negative impacts. 12&#8208;Crown&#8208;4&#160;as an efficient phase&#8208;transfer catalyst promotes the dissolution of LiTFSI without requiring acetonitrile. A combined experimental and theoretical study demonstrates the host&#8211;guest interaction between Li+ ions and 12&#8208;crown&#8208;4. Crowning Li+ ions by forming more stable and less diffusive crown&#8208;ether&#8211;Li+ complexes retards the generation of hygroscopic lithium oxides and mitigates Li+&#8208;ion migration. Optimized PSCs deliver enhanced PCE and significantly improved stability under humid and thermal conditions compared with a control device. This method can also be applied to dope &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymer. The findings provide a facile avenue to improve the long&#8208;term stability of PSCs.

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer with Integrated Soft Thermoelectrics for Shape Memory Actuation and Energy Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A liquid crystal elastomer (LCE) thermoelectric device is reported, which combining active Peltier heating and cooling of LCE, along with environmental and regenerative Seebeck energy harvesting in a 3D printed material architecture. A new method of actuating LCEs, along with a new, more efficient approach to soft robotics, is introduced.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) have attracted tremendous interest as actuators for soft robotics due to their mechanical and shape memory properties. However, LCE actuators typically respond to thermal stimulation through active Joule heating and passive cooling, which make them difficult to control. In this work, LCEs are combined with soft, stretchable thermoelectrics to create transducers capable of electrically controlled actuation, active cooling, and thermal&#8208;to&#8208;electrical energy conversion. The thermoelectric layers are composed of semiconductors embedded within a 3D printed elastomer matrix and wired together with eutectic gallium&#8211;indium (EGaIn) liquid metal interconnects. This layer is covered on both sides with LCE, which alternately heats and cools to achieve cyclical bending actuation in response to voltage&#8208;controlled Peltier activation. Moreover, the thermoelectric layer can harvest energy from thermal gradients between the two LCE layers through the Seebeck effect, allowing for regenerative energy harvesting. As demonstrations, first, closed&#8208;loop control of the transducer is performed to rapidly track a changing actuator position. Second, a soft robotic walker that is capable of walking toward a heat source and harvesting energy is introduced. Lastly, phototropic&#8208;inspired autonomous deflection of the limbs toward a heat source is shown, demonstrating an additional method to increase energy recuperation efficiency for soft systems.

         <title>Giant Spin Hall Effect and Spin&#8211;Orbit Torques in 5d Transition Metal&#8211;Aluminum Alloys from Extrinsic Scattering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Chiral domain walls are moved with current pulses highly efficiently along synthetic antiferromagnetic racetracks formed on thin underlayers of several 5d&#8208;Al alloys. These alloys exhibit very large spin Hall angles of up to &#8776;1.0 and, moreover, template [001] oriented Co&#8211;Ni multilayers with high perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, making them highly useful for racetrack memories compatible with complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor technologies.








Abstract
The generation of spin currents from charge currents via the spin Hall effect (SHE) is of fundamental and technological interest. Here, some of the largest SHEs yet observed via extrinsic scattering are found in a large class of binary compounds formed from a 5d element and aluminum, with a giant spin Hall angle (SHA) of &#8776;1 in the compound Os22Al78. A critical composition of the 5d element is found at which there is a structural phase boundary between poorly and highly textured crystalline material, where the SHA exhibits its largest value. Furthermore, a systematic increase is found in the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) and SHA at this critical composition as the atomic number of the 5d element is systematically increased. This clearly shows that the SHE and SHC are derived from extrinsic scattering mechanisms related to the potential mismatch between the 5d element and Al. These studies show the importance of extrinsic mechanisms derived from potential mismatch as a route to obtaining large spin Hall angles with high technological impact. Indeed, it is demonstrated that a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art racetrack device has a several&#8208;fold increased current&#8208;induced domain wall efficiency using these materials as compared to prior&#8208;art materials.

         <title>A Universal Strategy of Intermolecular Exchange to Stabilize &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 and Manage Crystal Orientation for High&#8208;Performance Humid&#8208;Air&#8208;Processed Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine is introduced via antisolvent engineering into a formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskite film, which promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis and superior stability.








Abstract
Preparation of high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)&#8208;based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, long&#8208;chain n&#8208;heptylamine (nHA) is introduced via antisolvent engineering into an FA&#8208;based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior.

&lt;p&gt;Long-chain n-heptylamine is introduced via antisolvent engineering into a formamidine (FA)-based perovskite film, which promotes the formation of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis and superior stability.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Preparation of high-performance perovskite solar cells without strict environmental control is an inevitable trend of commercialization. Humidity is considered the main factor hindering perovskite performance. Formamidine (FA)-based perovskites suffer from the instability of photoactive black &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3,&lt;/sub&gt; especially in humid air, and numerous defects in the surface and bulk of perovskite films limit their performance. In this work, long-chain n-heptylamine (nHA) is introduced via antisolvent engineering into an FA-based perovskite film. nHA removes the negative intermediate adduct and promotes the formation of &#945;-FAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; at room temperature in humid air via intermolecular exchange behavior. Moreover, the existence of nHA in the final perovskite film also reduces the defects and suppresses ion migration. The champion device delivers a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.7% (certificated 22.76%) with negligible hysteresis, and the fabricated devices exhibit superior reproductivity. The device stability is also enhanced, maintaining 95% of its initial PCE after 1500 h in ambient air. Moreover, the PCE has no attenuation at the maximum power point under continuous 1-sun light soaking for 500 h. The universality of this method is also demonstrated by other perovskite compositions, including methylamine lead iodine (MAPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and FA&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;

         <title>Acid&#8208;in&#8208;Clay Electrolyte for Wide&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Range and Long&#8208;Cycle Proton Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte is prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, ranking top among the solid proton conductors in terms of high proton conductivities, enlarged electrochemical stability window, and reduced chemical reactivity. Benefitting from the above advantages, the acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte can solve two main challenges in proton batteries: gassing and poor cycling performance.








Abstract
Proton conduction underlies many important electrochemical technologies. A family of new proton electrolytes is reported: acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay electrolyte (AiCE) prepared by integrating fast proton carriers in a natural phyllosilicate clay network, which can be made into thin&#8208;film (tens of micrometers) fluid&#8208;impervious membranes. The chosen example systems (sepiolite&#8211;phosphoric acid) rank top among the solid proton conductors in terms of proton conductivities (15 mS cm&#8722;1 at 25&#160;&#176;C, 0.023 mS cm&#8722;1 at &#8722;82&#160;&#176;C), electrochemical stability window (3.35&#160;V), and reduced chemical reactivity. A proton battery is assembled using AiCE as the solid electrolyte membrane. Benefitting from the wider electrochemical stability window, reduced corrosivity, and excellent ionic selectivity of AiCE, the two main problems (gassing and cyclability) of proton batteries are successfully solved. This work draws attention to the element cross&#8208;over problem in proton batteries and the generic &#8220;acid&#8208;in&#8208;clay&#8221; solid electrolyte approach with superfast proton transport, outstanding selectivity, and improved stability for room&#8208; to cryogenic&#8208;temperature protonic applications.

         <title>Photoexcitation Dynamics and Long&#8208;Lived Excitons in Strain&#8208;Engineered Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The transient absorption in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides grown on fused silica by the laser&#8208;assisted synthesis technique exhibits very unusual decay dynamics that feature long&#8208;lived components progressively increasing with the excitation fluence. The experimental observations are interpreted as resulting from the strain&#8208;induced modification of the electronic bands and concomitant interplay of the intervalley and intravalley excitons&#8217; populations.








Abstract
Strain&#8208;engineering in 2D transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors has garnered intense research interest in tailoring the optical properties via strain&#8208;induced modifications of the electronic bands in TMDs, while its impact on the exciton dynamics remains less understood. To address this, an extensive study of transient optical absorption (TA) of both W&#8208; and Mo&#8208;based single&#8208;crystalline monolayer TMDs grown by a recently developed laser&#8208;assisted evaporation method is performed. All spectral features of the monolayers as grown on fused silica substrates exhibit appreciable redshifts relating to the existence of strain due to growth conditions. Moreover, these systems exhibit a dramatic slowing down of exciton dynamics (100s of picoseconds to few nanoseconds) with an increase in carrier densities, which strongly contrasts with the monolayers in their freestanding form as well as in comparison with more traditionally grown TMDs. The observations are related to the modifications of the electronic bands as expected from the strain and associated population of the intervalley dark excitons that can now interplay with intravalley excitations. These findings are consistent across both the Mo&#8208; and W&#8208;based TMD families, providing key information about the influence of the growth conditions on the nature of optical excitations and fostering emerging optoelectronic applications of monolayer TMDs.

         <title>Stretchable Redox&#8208;Active Semiconducting Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymer with stretchability up to 200% strain and 5000 repeated cycles is reported. The strain&#8208;induced electrical performance and structural evolution are systematically studied. An intrinsically stretchable organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) is fabricated to give the a normalized Gm of 233 S cm&#8722;1 and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Real&#8208;time on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram signal recording is realized.








Abstract
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) represent an emerging device platform for next&#8208;generation bioelectronics owing to the uniquely high amplification and sensitivity to biological signals. For achieving seamless tissue&#8211;electronics interfaces for accurate signal acquisition, skin&#8208;like softness and stretchability are essential requirements, but they have not yet been imparted onto high&#8208;performance OECTs, largely due to the lack of stretchable redox&#8208;active semiconducting polymers. Here, a stretchable semiconductor is reported for OECT devices, namely poly(2&#8208;(3,3&#8242;&#8208;bis(2&#8208;(2&#8208;(2&#8208;methoxyethoxy)ethoxy)ethoxy)&#8208;[2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen]&#8208;5)yl thiophene) (p(g2T&#8208;T)), which gives exceptional stretchability over 200% strain and 5000 repeated stretching cycles, together with OECT performance on par with the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art. Validated by systematic characterizations and comparisons of different polymers, the key design features of this polymer that enable the combination of high stretchability and high OECT performance are a nonlinear backbone architecture, a moderate side&#8208;chain density, and a sufficiently high molecular weight. Using this highly stretchable polymer semiconductor, an intrinsically stretchable OECT is fabricated with high normalized transconductance (&#8776;223 S cm&#8722;1) and biaxial stretchability up to 100% strain. Furthermore, on&#8208;skin electrocardiogram (ECG) recording is demonstrated, which combines built&#8208;in amplification and unprecedented skin conformability.

         <title>Adaptive Self&#8208;Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain&#8208;Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain&#8208;insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1&#8208;decanethiol, the nanomaterials self&#8208;organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain&#8208;insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.








Abstract
Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here, a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block&#8208;copolymer matrix is presented. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&lt;50% strain). It is demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self&#8208;organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strain when their surface is conjugated with 1&#8208;decanethiol. Distinct self&#8208;organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions are found. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials can render the resistance of the nanocomposites insensitive to uniaxial or biaxial strains. As a result, the resistance can be maintained with a variance of &lt;&#160;1% during 1000 stretching cycles under uniaxial and biaxial strains of &lt;50% while a high conductivity of &#8776;31&#160;000 S cm&#8722;1 is achieved.

     alt="Adaptive Self-Organization of Nanomaterials Enables Strain-Insensitive Resistance of Stretchable Metallic Nanocomposites"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A material strategy to fabricate a stretchable metallic nanocomposite with strain-insensitive resistance is proposed. When the surface of silver nanomaterials is treated with 1-decanethiol, the nanomaterials self-organize in response to external strain. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials enables preservation of the percolation networks, resulting in strain-insensitive resistance of the nanocompsite.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites are promising material candidates for skin electronics. However, the resistance of stretchable metallic nanocomposites highly depends on external strains, often deteriorating the performance of fabricated electronic devices. Here, a material strategy for the highly conductive and stretchable nanocomposites comprising metal nanomaterials of various dimensions and a viscoelastic block-copolymer matrix is presented. The resistance of the nanocomposites can be well retained under skin deformations (&amp;lt;50% strain). It is demonstrated that silver nanomaterials can self-organize inside the viscoelastic media in response to external strain when their surface is conjugated with 1-decanethiol. Distinct self-organization behaviors associated with nanomaterial dimensions and strain conditions are found. Adopting the optimum composition of 0D/1D/2D silver nanomaterials can render the resistance of the nanocomposites insensitive to uniaxial or biaxial strains. As a result, the resistance can be maintained with a variance of &amp;lt;&#160;1% during 1000 stretching cycles under uniaxial and biaxial strains of &amp;lt;50% while a high conductivity of &#8776;31&#160;000 S cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A Better Choice to Achieve High Volumetric Energy Density: Anode&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The density of Li metal is low, so the abuse of Li foil in Li&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) can easily lead to the loss of their advantage in volumetric energy density over Li&#8208;ion batteries. In addition, Li plating on a Li substrate is not as dense as that on a Cu substrate. Therefore, anode&#8208;free LMBs are more worthy of recommendation.








Abstract
Volumetric energy density is a critical but easily neglected index of lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs). Compared with gravimetric energy density, the volumetric energy density (VED) of LMBs is much more sensitive to the anode/cathode (A/C) ratio due to the low density of lithium (Li) metal and the volume expansion of the Li&#8208;metal anode owing to its pulverization during cycles. Anode&#8208;free LMBs (AF&#8208;LMBs) have high theoretical VED due to the absence of an anode and high retention with relatively low cell expansion. Because Li plating highly depends on the mother substrate, Li plating on copper (Cu) substrates is more reversible and denser than that on Li substrates during cycling, which is beneficial for maintaining high volumetric capacity and efficient Li utilization. Therefore, considering that excess Li must be strictly limited to achieve competitive energy density, AF&#8208;LMBs (with bare Cu foil as the anode current collector) for high&#8208;volumetric&#8208;density batteries are recommended.

         <title>Facile, Energy&#8208;Efficient Microscale Fibrillation of Polyacrylamides under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Insight into fiber formation can provide rationale for the design of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. An energy&#8208;efficient route to formation of fibers with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is reported. This strategy offers a molecular&#8208;level understanding of fiber formation under ambient conditions which reduces current required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude.








Abstract
Insight into fiber formation can provide new rationale for the design and preparation of fibers with programmed mechanical properties. While synthetic bioinspired fibers have shown impressive tensile properties, the fiber formation process remains poorly understood. Moreover, these systems are highly complex and their formation is environmentally and economically costly. Controlled fiber formation under ambient conditions from polyacrylamide solutions with properties comparable to natural fibers such as wool and coir is demonstrated. Photopolymerization and subsequent microscale fibrillation of different acrylamides in water/ethanol mixtures yield a simple and energy&#8208;efficient route to fiber formation. This strategy reduces required processing energy by two&#8208;to&#8208;three orders of magnitude. Through extensive experimental elucidation, insight into precise fiber forming conditions of polymeric solutions is achieved. Ethanol is utilized as a chain transfer agent to control the molecular weight of the polyacrylamides, and the entanglement regimes of the solutions are determined through rheological characterization showing fiber formation above the entanglement concentration. Unique from previously reported hydrogel microfibers, it is shown that fibers with good mechanical properties can be obtained without the need for composites or crosslinkers. The reported approach offers a platform for fiber formation under ambient conditions with molecular&#8208;level understanding of their&#160;assembly.

         <title>Spanning Network Gels from Nanoparticles and Graph Theoretical Analysis of Their Structure and Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogels of lead telluride nanoparticles are structurally characterized using graph theory. The morphology of the gels is quantified, identifying the effect of various salt concentrations and compositions on the connectivity of the network structures. Significant influence by divalent cations on gel structure is observed. Relationships between the structural descriptors and viscoelastic and charge transport properties are evaluated.








Abstract
Gels self&#8208;assembled from colloidal nanoparticles (NPs) translate the size&#8208;dependent properties of nanostructures to materials with macroscale volumes. Large spanning networks of NP chains provide high interconnectivity within the material necessary for a wide range of properties from conductivity to viscoelasticity. However, a great challenge for nanoscale engineering of such gels lies in being able to accurately and quantitatively describe their complex non&#8208;crystalline structure that combines order and disorder. The quantitative relationships between the mesoscale structural and material properties of nanostructured gels are currently unknown. Here, it is shown that lead telluride NPs spontaneously self&#8208;assemble into a spanning network hydrogel. By applying graph theory (GT), a method for quantifying the complex structure of the NP gels is established using a topological descriptor of average nodal connectivity that is found to correlate with the gel's mechanical and charge transport properties. GT descriptions make possible the design of non&#8208;crystalline porous materials from a variety of nanoscale components for photonics, catalysis, adsorption, and thermoelectrics.

         <title>Foldable Solid&#8208;State Batteries Enabled by Electrolyte Mediation in Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state electrolyte by engineering of the molecular channels in lithiated covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is presented. In situ electrolyte mediation in the COF increases charge&#8208;carrier concentration, eliminates interfacial defects, and activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner. The COF&#8208;based electrolyte demonstrates reliable electrochemical cyclability in pouch cells.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state electrolytes with high Li+ conductivity, flexibility, durability, and stability offer an attractive solution to enhance safety and energy density. However, meeting these stringent requirements poses challenges to the existing solid polymeric or ceramic electrolytes. Here, an electrolyte&#8208;mediated single&#8208;Li+&#8208;conductive covalent organic framework (COF) is presented, which represents a new category of quality solid&#8208;state Li+ conductors. In situ solidification of a tailored liquid electrolyte boosts the charge&#8208;carrier concentration in the COF channels, decouples Li+ cations from both COF walls and molecular chains, and eliminates defects by crystal soldering. Such an altered microenvironment activates the motion of Li+ ions in a directional manner, which leads to an increase in Li+ conductivity by 100 times with a transference number of 0.85 achieved at room temperature. Moreover, the electrolyte conversion cements the ultrathin COF membrane with fortified mechanical toughness. With the COF membrane, foldable solid&#8208;state pouch cells are demonstrated.

Quantum imaging of spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;driven magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films is achieved using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. Off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also established, highlighting the significant potential of NV centers in diagnosing the local magnetic properties of emergent quantum materials with vanishingly small magnetic moments.








Abstract
Novel non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets with spontaneous time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking, non&#8208;trivial band topology, and unconventional transport properties have received immense research interest over the past decade due to their rich physics and enormous promise in technological applications. One of the central focuses in this emerging field is exploring the relationship between the microscopic magnetic structure and exotic material properties. Here, nanoscale imaging of both spin&#8211;orbit&#8208;torque&#8208;induced deterministic magnetic switching and chiral spin rotation in non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn films using nitrogen&#8208;vacancy (NV) centers are reported. Direct evidence of the off&#8208;resonance dipole&#8211;dipole coupling between the spin dynamics in Mn3Sn and proximate NV centers is also demonstrated by NV relaxometry measurements. These results demonstrate the unique capabilities of NV centers in accessing the local information of the magnetic order and dynamics in these emergent quantum materials and suggest new opportunities for investigating the interplay between topology and magnetism in a broad range of topological magnets.

         <title>Cascade Downregulation of the HER Family by a Dual&#8208;Targeted Recombinant Protein&#8211;Drug Conjugate to Inhibit Tumor Growth and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#160;and integrin &#945;v&#946;3&#160;dual&#8208;targeted recombinant protein drug conjugate can downregulate the expressions of the HER family including EGFR (HER1), HER2, HER3, and HER4, inhibit the downstream signaling pathways, and improve the drug accumulation and distribution in tumors, leading to reduction of tumor size and significant inhibition of tumor metastasis.








Abstract
Human epidermal growth factor receptor type 2 (HER2)&#8208;targeted therapy can significantly improve the outcome of patients with HER2&#160;positive cancer. However, relapse after this treatment remains a great challenge in the clinic due to tumor resistance, in which the HER network induces constitutive signal transduction. In addition, integrin receptors in the tumor extracellular matrix can mitigate the therapeutic effect of inhibitors to the growth factors receptors and tyrosine kinases. Here, the development of a recombinant protein (RP&#8208;HI) and its drug conjugates (RPDC&#8208;HI) to target both HER2&#160;and integrin is reported. When simultaneously blocking HER2&#160;and integrin by RP&#8208;HI, functions of the HER family and their interactions with the integrin are disrupted by downregulated expressions of HER family members, leading to inhibition of several downstream signal pathways. In combination with targeted delivery of the anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX), RPDC&#8208;HI significantly improves the tumor inhibition efficacy to 97.5% in treating HER2&#8208;positive breast cancer, comparing to 34.3% for free DOX. RPDC&#8208;HI shows even better antitumor efficiency than a monoclonal antibody, trastuzumab, when treating larger tumors. The developed dual&#8208;targeted RPDC platform offers a new and promising strategy for treating HER2&#8208;positive patients with synergistic therapeutic effects against tumor resistance to the conventional HER2&#8208;targeted treatment.

         <title>Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimers that Underpin High&#8208;Efficiency Host&#8208;Free Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rational design of a donor&#8211;acceptor dendrimer emitter that shows remarkable photophysical properties, including efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) and high photoluminescence quantum yield, is reported. Its use is demonstrated in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) that shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;performance solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) remains a challenge. An effective solution, highlighted in this work, is to use highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimers as emitters. Here, the design, synthesis, density functional theory (DFT) modeling, and photophysics of three triazine&#8208;based dendrimers, tBuCz2pTRZ, tBuCz2mTRZ, and tBuCz2m2pTRZ, is reported, which resolve the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small &#916;EST and a large oscillator strength by incorporating both meta&#8208; and para&#8208;connected donor dendrons about a central triazine acceptor. The solution&#8208;processed OLED containing a host&#8208;free emitting layer exhibits an excellent maximum external quantum efficiency (EQEmax) of 28.7%, a current efficiency of 98.8&#160;cd A&#8722;1, and a power efficiency of 91.3&#160;lm W&#8722;1. The device emits with an electroluminescence maximum, &#955;EL, of 540&#160;nm and Commission International de l'&#201;clairage (CIE) color coordinates of (0.37, 0.57). This represents the most efficient host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed OLED reported to date. Further optimization directed at improving the charge balance within the device results in an emissive layer containing 30 wt% OXD&#8208;7, which leads to an OLED with the similar EQEmax of 28.4% but showing a significantly improved efficiency rolloff where the EQE remains high at 22.7% at a luminance of 500&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>A Robust Memristor Based on Epitaxial Vertically Aligned Nanostructured BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 Films on Silicon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composite films system consisting of ferroelectric material and dielectric film is proposed as a memristor medium to improve the comprehensive performances of the resistive&#8208;switching behavior, and epitaxial BaTiO3&#8722;CeO2 ferroelectric films on silicon are obtained successfully. The durability of the device is more than 109 cycles, and the speed can be lower than 10 ns.








Abstract
With the exploration of ferroelectric materials, researchers have a strong desire to explore the next generation of non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memory with silicon&#8208;based epitaxy, high&#8208;density storage, and algebraic operations. Herein, a silicon&#8208;based memristor with an epitaxial vertically aligned nanostructures BaTiO3&#8211;CeO2 film based on La0.67Sr0.33MnO3/SrTiO3/Si substrate is reported. The ferroelectric polarization reversal is optimized through the continuous exploring of growth temperature, and the epitaxial structure is obtained, thus it improves the resistance characteristic, the multi&#8208;value storage function of five states is achieved, and the robust endurance characteristic can reach 109 cycles. In the synapse plasticity modulated by pulse voltage process, the function of the spiking&#8208;time&#8208;dependent plasticity and paired&#8208;pulse facilitation is simulated successfully. More importantly, the algebraic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are realized by using fast speed pulse of the width &#8776;50&#160;ns. Subsequently, a convolutional neural network is constructed for identifying the CIFAR&#8208;10 dataset, to simulate the performance of the device; the online and offline learning recognition rate reach 90.03% and 92.55%, respectively. Overall, this study paves the way for memristors with silicon&#8208;based epitaxial ferroelectric films to realize multi&#8208;value storage, algebraic operations, and neural computing chip applications.

2D MBenes, early transition metal borides, are a very recent derivative of ternary or quaternary transition metal boride (MAB) phases and represent a new member in the flatland.

Theoretical calculations and preliminary experimental attempts demonstrate their rich chemistry, excellent reactivity, mechanical strength/stability, electrical conductivity, transition properties, and energy harvesting possibility. Compared to MXenes, MBenes&#8217; structure appears to be more complex due to multiple crystallographic arrangements, polymorphism, and structural transformations. This makes their synthesis and subsequent delamination into single flakes challenging. Overcoming this bottleneck will enable a rational control over MBenes&#8217; material&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationship. Innovations in MBenes&#8217; postprocessing approaches will allow for the design of new functional systems and devices with multipurpose functionalities thus opening a promising paradigm for the conscious design of high&#8208;performance 2D materials.

         <title>Porous Polymers as Universal Reversal Agents for Heparin Anticoagulants through an Inclusion&#8211;Sequestration Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy is developed by making use of multicationic supramolecular organic frameworks and porous organic polymers as porous antidotes to neutralize heparins. In vitro and in vivo experiments and biocompatibility evaluations confirm that the porous polymers can realize rapid, safe, and universal reversal of heparin&#8208;based anticoagulants, superior to that of clinically used protamine.








Abstract
Heparins are widely used anticoagulants for surgical procedures and extracorporeal therapies. However, all of them have bleeding risks. Protamine sulfate, the only clinically approved antidote for unfractionated heparin (UFH), has adverse effects. Moreover, protamine can only partially neutralize low&#8208;molecular&#8208;weight heparins (LMWHs) and is not effective for fondaparinux. Here, an inclusion&#8211;sequestration strategy for efficient neutralization of heparin anticoagulants by cationic porous supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs) and porous organic polymers (POPs) is reported. Isothermal titration calorimetric and fluorescence experiments show strong binding affinities of these porous polymers toward heparins, whereas dynamic light scattering and zeta potential analysis confirm that the heparin sequences are adsorbed into the interior of the porous hosts. Activated partial thromboplastin time, anti&#8208;FXa, and thromboelastography assays indicate that their neutralization efficacies are higher than or as high as that of protamine for UFH and generally superior to protamine for LMWHs and fondaparinux, which is further confirmed by tail&#8208;transection model in mice and ex vivo aPTT or anti&#8208;FXa analysis in rats. Acute toxicity evaluations reveal that one of the SOFs displays outstanding biocompatibility. This work suggests that porous polymers can supply safe and rapid reversal of clinically used heparins, as protamine surrogates, providing an improved approach for their neutralization.

         <title>Polyiodide Confinement by Starch Enables Shuttle&#8208;Free Zn&#8211;Iodine Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the significant chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, the shuttle effect of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries is effectively addressed by using starch, which strongly anchors polyiodide anions due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. Benefiting from this structure confinement, a Coulombic efficiency of almost 100% and an ultralong life of 50&#160;000 cycles are realized in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8211;iodine (Zn&#8211;I2) batteries have been regarded as a promising energy&#8208;storage system owing to their high energy/power density, safety, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the polyiodide shuttling results in serious active mass loss and Zn corrosion, which limits the cycling life of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries. Inspired by the chromogenic reaction between starch and iodine, a structure confinement strategy is proposed to suppress polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries by hiring starch, due to its unique double&#8208;helix structure. In situ Raman spectroscopy demonstrates an I5&#8722;&#8208;dominated I&#8722;/I2 conversion mechanism when using starch. The I5&#8722; presents a much stronger bonding with starch than I3&#8722;, inhibiting the polyiodide shuttling in Zn&#8211;I2 batteries, which is confirmed by in situ ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectra. Consequently, a highly reversible Zn&#8211;I2 battery with high Coulombic efficiency (&#8776;100% at 0.2 A g&#8722;1) and ultralong cycling stability (&gt;50&#160;000 cycles) is realized. Simultaneously, the Zn corrosion triggered by polyiodide is effectively inhibited owing to the desirable shuttling&#8208;suppression by the starch, as evidenced by X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis. This work provides a new understanding of the failure mechanism of Zn&#8211;I2 batteries and proposes a cheap but effective strategy to realize high&#8208;cyclability Zn&#8211;I2 batteries.

         <title>Platelet Pharmacytes for the Hierarchical Amplification of Antitumor Immunity in Response to Self&#8208;Generated Immune Signals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive platelet pharmacytes, consisting of encapsulated Rab27a siRNA nanocomplexes and backpacked anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 nanogels, are engineered to hierarchically amplify antitumor immunity. The platelet pharmacytes efficiently silence Rab27a in tumor cells to inhibit secretion of tumor&#8208;derived exosomes, which relieves the immunosuppression and cascadingly releases anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1&#8208;mediated immune checkpoint blockade.








Abstract
Systemic immunosuppression mediated by tumor&#8208;derived exosomes is an important cause for the resistance of immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy. Herein, self&#8208;adaptive platelet (PLT) pharmacytes are engineered to mediate cascaded delivery of exosome&#8208;inhibiting siRNA and anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 (aPDL1) toward synergized antitumor immunity. In the pharmacytes, polycationic nanocomplexes (NCs) assembled from Rab27 siRNA (siRab) and a membrane&#8208;penetrating polypeptide are encapsulated inside the open canalicular system of PLTs, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs)&#8208;responsive aPDL1 nanogels (NGs) are covalently backpacked on the PLT surface. Upon systemic administration, the pharmacytes enable prolonged blood circulation and active accumulation to tumors, wherein PLTs are activated to liberate siRab NCs, which efficiently transfect tumor cells, silence Rab27a, and inhibit exosome secretion. The immunosuppression is thus relieved, leading to the activation, proliferation, and tumoral infiltration of cytotoxic T cells, which trigger latent aPDL1 release. As such, the competitive aPDL1 exhaustion by PD&#8208;L1&#8208;expressing exosomes is minimized to sensitize ICB. Synergistically, siRab and aPDL1 induce strong antitumor immunological response and memory against syngeneic murine melanoma. This study reports a bioinspired mechanism to resolve the blood circulation/cell internalization contradiction of polycationic siRNA delivery systems, and renders an enlightened approach for the spatiotemporal enhancement of antitumor immunity.

         <title>pH&#8208;Responsive Polymer Nanoparticles for Efficient Delivery of Cas9 Ribonucleoprotein With or Without Donor DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ&#8208;NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR&#8208;NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.








Abstract
Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)&#8208;associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology&#8208;directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH&#8208;responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ&#8208;NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR&#8208;NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported.

&lt;p&gt;CRISPR-Cas9 may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology-directed repair (HDR). In this work, facilely fabricated pH-responsive polymer nanoparticles, capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (NHEJ-NP) or together with donor DNA (HDR-NP), are developed for gene editing in mouse liver, lung, or skeletal muscle.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)-associated protein 9 (Cas9) may offer new therapeutics for genetic diseases through gene disruption via nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) or gene correction via homology-directed repair (HDR). However, clinical translation of CRISPR technology is limited by the lack of safe and efficient delivery systems. Here, facilely fabricated pH-responsive polymer nanoparticles capable of safely and efficiently delivering Cas9 ribonucleoprotein alone (termed NHEJ-NP, diameter = 29.4&#160;nm), or together with donor DNA (termed HDR-NP, diameter = 33.3&#160;nm) are reported. Moreover, intravenously, intratracheally, and intramuscularly injected NHEJ-NP induces efficient gene editing in mouse liver, lung, and skeletal muscle, respectively. Intramuscularly injected HDR-NP also leads to muscle strength recovery in a Duchenne muscular dystrophy mouse model. NHEJ-NP and HDR-NP possess many desirable properties including high payload loading content, small and uniform sizes, high editing efficiency, good biocompatibility, low immunogenicity, and ease of production, storage, and transport, making them great interest for various genome editing applications with clinical potentials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Negative Phototransistors with Ultrahigh Sensitivity and Weak&#8208;Light Detection Based on 1D/2D Molecular Crystal p&#8211;n Heterojunctions and their Application in Light Encoders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrasensitive negative phototransistors are developed based on 1D/2D molecular crystal (1D/2DMC) p&#8211;n heterojunctions. This unique structure utilizes photogenerated holes of p&#8208;type 1DMCs to dope electron carriers in n&#8208;type 2DMC channels under UV illumination, achieving complete depletion of the channel current. The negative phototransistor exhibits superior performance parameters, accurately controllable threshold voltage by light, and ultrasensitive detection of weak light.








Abstract
Anomalous negative phototransistors in which the channel current decreases under light illumination hold potential to generate novel and multifunctional optoelectronic applications. Although a variety of design strategies have been developed to construct such devices, NPTs still suffer from far lower device performance compared to well&#8208;developed positive phototransistors (PPTs). In this work, a novel 1D/2D molecular crystal p&#8211;n heterojunction, in which p&#8208;type 1D molecular crystal (1DMC) arrays are embedded into n&#8208;type 2D molecular crystals (2DMCs), is developed to produce ultrasensitive NPTs. The p&#8208;type 1DMC arrays act as light&#8208;absorbing layers to induce p&#8208;doping of n&#8208;type 2DMCs through charge transfer under illumination, resulting in ineffective gate control and significant negative photoresponses. As a result, the NPTs show remarkable performances in photoresponsivity (P) (1.9&#160;&#215;&#160;108) and detectivity (D*) (1.7&#160;&#215;&#160;1017 Jones), greatly outperforming previously reported NPTs, which are one of the highest values among all organic phototransistors. Moreover, the device exhibits intriguing characteristics undiscovered in PPTs, including precise control of the threshold voltage by controlling light signals and ultrasensitive detection of weak light. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, the NTPs are demonstrated as light encoders that can encrypt electrical signals by light. These findings represent a milestone for negative phototransistors, and pave the way for the development of future novel optoelectronic applications.

         <title>An Ultrafast, Durable, and High&#8208;Loading Polymer Anode for Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries and Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable, cheap, fast (100 A g&#8722;1), stable (1&#160;000&#160;000 cycles), and high&#8208;loading (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) polymer anode is developed for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte, surpassing the Zn&#8208;metal anode.








Abstract
Zn metal has shown promise as an anode material for grid&#8208;level energy storage, yet is challenged by dendritic growth and low Coulombic efficiency. Herein, an ultrafast, stable, and high&#8208;loading polymer anode for aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries and capacitors (ZIBs and ZICs) is developed by engineering both the electrode and electrolyte. The anode polymer is rationally prepared to have a suitable electronic structure and a large &#960;&#8208;conjugated structure, whereas the electrolyte is manufactured based on the superiority of triflate anions over sulfate anions, as analyzed and confirmed via experiments and simulations. This dual engineering results in an optimal polymer anode with a low discharge potential, near&#8208;theoretical capacity, ultrahigh&#8208;loading capability (&#8776;50&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), ultrafast rate (100 A g&#8722;1), and ultralong lifespan (one million cycles). Its mechanism involves reversible Zn2+/proton co&#8208;storage at the carbonyl site. When the polymer anode is coupled with cathodes for both ZIB and ZIC applications, the devices demonstrate ultrahigh power densities and ultralong lifespans, far surpassing those of corresponding Zn&#8208;metal&#8208;based devices.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Mode Organic Electrochemical Transistors Based on Self&#8208;Doped Conjugated Polyelectrolytes for Reconfigurable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
With PCPDTBT&#8208;SO3K (CPE&#8208;K) as the active material, dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors that operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode are demonstrated. Mode switching is done via changing the polarity of the applied voltages, enabled by the dual&#8208;mode absorption capabilities of CPE&#8208;K. These transistors are used to create reconfigurable logic gates, paving the way for the use of organic electrochemical transistors in emerging reconfigurable electronics.








Abstract
Reconfigurable organic logic devices are promising candidates for next generations of efficient computing systems and adaptive electronics. Ideally, such devices would be of simple structure and design, be power efficient, and compatible with high&#8208;throughput microfabrication techniques. This work reports an organic reconfigurable logic gate based on novel dual&#8208;mode organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), which employ a self&#8208;doped conjugated polyelectrolyte as the active material, which then allows the transistors to operate in both depletion mode and enhancement mode. Furthermore, mode switching is accomplished by simply altering the polarity of the applied gate and drain voltages, which can be done on the fly. In contrast, achieving similar mode&#8208;switching functionality with other organic transistors typically requires complex molecular design or multi&#8208;device engineering. It in shown that dual&#8208;mode functionality is enabled by the concurrent existence of anion doping and cation dedoping of the films. A device physics model that accurately describes the behavior of these transistors is developed. Finally, the utility of these dual&#8208;mode transistors for implementing reconfigurable logic by fabricating a logic gate that may be switched between logic gates AND to NOR, and OR to NAND on the fly is demonstrated.

         <title>Ultrathin Van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrTe3 for Fabrication of In&#8208;Plane CrTe3/CrTe2 Monolayer Magnetic Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrathin CrTe3 films are successfully synthesized. Monolayer (ML) CrTe3 represents a unique van der Waals (vdW) magnet with intralayer antiferromagnetism, which is identified by scanning probe microscopy. A facile method is developed to fabricate CrTe3/CrTe2 magnetic heterostructures from ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface, which is significant for the development of miniaturized spintronic devices based on vdW magnets.








Abstract
Ultrathin van der Waals (vdW) magnets are heavily pursued for potential applications in developing high&#8208;density miniaturized electronic/spintronic devices as well as for topological physics in low&#8208;dimensional structures. Despite the rapid advances in ultrathin ferromagnetic vdW magnets, the antiferromagnetic counterparts, as well as the antiferromagnetic junctions, are much less studied owing to the difficulties in both material fabrication and magnetism characterization. Ultrathin CrTe3 layers have been theoretically proposed to be a vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer (ML) and bilayer CrTe3 on graphite surface is demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the ML CrTe3 are characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non&#8208;contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The CrTe3 MLs can be further utilized for the fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of ML CrTe2 and ML CrTe3 with an atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since ML CrTe2 is a metallic vdW magnet, such a heterostructure presents the first in&#8208;plane magnetic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe3, as well as the magnetic heterojunction, will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.

Ultrathin CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; layers have been theoretically proposed to be a vdW antiferromagnetic semiconductor with intrinsic intralayer antiferromagnetism. Herein, the epitaxial growth of monolayer (ML) and bilayer CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; on graphite surface is demonstrated. The structure, electronic and magnetic properties of the ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are characterized by combining scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy and non-contact atomic force microscopy and confirmed by density functional theory calculations. The CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; MLs can be further utilized for the fabrication of a lateral heterojunction consisting of ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; with an atomically sharp and seamless interface. Since ML CrTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is a metallic vdW magnet, such a heterostructure presents the first in-plane magnetic metal&#8211;semiconductor heterojunction made of two vdW materials. The successful fabrication of ultrathin antiferromagnetic CrTe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as the magnetic heterojunction, will stimulate the development of miniaturized antiferromagnetic spintronic devices based on vdW materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

A facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries is proposed, and 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote the solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O); thus, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ delivers an ultrahigh discharge capacity and Li2O2 yield.








Abstract
Surface discharge mechanism induced cathode passivation is a critical challenge that blocks the full liberation of the ultrahigh theoretical energy density in aprotic Li&#8211;O2 batteries. Herein, a facile and universal concept of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation is proposed to trigger the solution discharge process for averting the shortcomings associated with surface discharge. 2,5&#8208;Di&#8208;tert&#8208;butylhydroquinone (DBHQ), an antioxidant with hydroxyl groups, is introduced as an exemplary soluble catalyst to promote solution discharge by hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solvation of O2&#8722; and Li2O2 (O&#63743;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O). Thus, a Li&#8211;O2 battery with 50&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;3 m DBHQ delivers an extraordinary discharge capacity of 18&#160;945 mAh g&#8722;1 (i.e., 9.47 mAh cm&#8722;2), even surpassing the capacity endowed by the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reduction mediator of 2,5&#8208;di&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;1,4&#8208;benzoquinone. Besides, an ultrahigh Li2O2 yield of 97.1% is also achieved due to the depressed reactivity of the reduced oxygen&#8208;containing species (O2&#8722;, LiO2, and Li2O2) by the solvating and antioxidative abilities of DBHQ. Consequently, the Li&#8211;O2 battery with DBHQ exhibits excellent cycling lifetime and rate capability. Furthermore, the generalizability of this approach of hydrogen&#8208;bond&#8208;assisted solution discharge is verified by other soluble catalysts that contain &#63743;OH or &#63743;NH groups, with implications that could bring Li&#8211;O2 batteries one step closer to being a viable technology.

High&#8208;quality gallium nitride (GaN)&#8208;based heterostructures are epitaxially grown on a 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;silicon carbide (SiC) substrate, based on which, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors are fabricated, suggesting a practical approach to realizing GaN/SiC hybrid field&#8208;effect transistors (HyFETs).

Abstract
A hybrid field&#8208;effect transistor (HyFET), superior for power electronic applications, can be created by harnessing the merits of two representative wide&#8208;bandgap semiconductors, gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC). Yet, the incompactness in the epitaxy techniques hinders the development of the HyFET&#8212;GaN is usually grown on on&#8208;axis foreign substrates including SiC, whereas SiC homoepitaxy prefers off&#8208;axis substrates. This work presents a GaN&#8208;based heterostructure epitaxially grown on a conventional 4&#176; off&#8208;axis 4H&#8208;SiC substrate, which manifests its high quality and suitability for constructing GaN&#8208;based high&#8208;electron&#8208;mobility transistors, thereby suggesting a practical approach to realizing HyFETs. In the meanwhile, a distinct two&#8208;step biaxial strain&#8208;relaxation process is proposed and studied with comprehensive characterizations.

         <title>In Situ Fabrication of Porous CoxP Hierarchical Nanostructures on Carbon Fiber Cloth with Exceptional Performance for Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mixed&#8208;valence strategy and construction of an &#8220;all in one&#8221; electrode is employed to prepare flexible carbon fiber cloth supported porous CoxP hierarchical structures comprising nanoneedles and nanosheets. The as&#8208;prepared CoxP@CFC electrode exhibits enhanced sodium&#8208;storage performance with a high reversible capacity (814&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1), remarkable rate performance (279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1), and record ultralong cycling life (almost 100%&#160;capacity retention after 9000&#160;cycles).








Abstract
Superior high&#8208;rate performance and ultralong cycling life have been constantly pursued for rechargeable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). In this work, a facile strategy is employed to successfully synthesize porous CoxP hierarchical nanostructures supported on a flexible carbon fiber cloth (CoxP@CFC), constructing a robust architecture of ordered nanoarrays. Via such a unique design, porous and bare structures can thoroughly expose the electroactive surfaces to the electrolyte, which is favorable for ultrafast sodium&#8208;ion storage. In addition, the CFC provides an interconnected 3D conductive network to ensure firm electrical connection of the electrode materials. Besides the inherent flexibility of the CFC, the integration of the hierarchical structures of CoxP with the CFC, as well as the strong synergistic effect between them, effectively help to buffer the mechanical stress caused by repeated sodiation/desodiation, thereby guaranteeing the structural integrity of the overall electrode. Consequently, CoxP@CFC as an anode shows a record&#8208;high capacity of 279&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 5.0&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1 with almost no capacity attenuation after 9000 cycles.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>

Abstract
Manipulation of the propagation and energy&#8208;transport characteristics of subwavelength infrared (IR) light fields is critical for the application of nanophotonic devices in photocatalysis, biosensing, and thermal management. In this context, metamaterials are useful composite materials, although traditional metal&#8208;based structures are constrained by their weak mid&#8208;IR response, while their associated capabilities for optical propagation and focusing are limited by the size of attainable artificial optical structures and the poor performance of the available active means of control. Herein, a tunable planar focusing device operating in the mid&#8208;IR region is reported by exploiting highly oriented in&#8208;plane hyperbolic phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3. Specifically, an unprecedented change of effective focal length of polariton waves from 0.7 to 7.4 &#956;m is demonstrated by the following three different means of control: the dimension of the device, the employed light frequency, and engineering of phonon&#8211;plasmon hybridization. The high confinement characteristics of phonon polaritons in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 permit the focal length and focal spot size to be reduced to 1/15 and 1/33 of the incident wavelength, respectively. In particular, the anisotropic phonon polaritons supported in &#945;&#8208;MoO3 are combined with tunable surface&#8208;plasmon polaritons in graphene to realize in situ and dynamical control of the focusing performance, thus paving the way for phonon&#8208;polariton&#8208;based planar nanophotonic applications.

     alt="Tunable Planar Focusing Based on Hyperbolic Phonon Polaritons in &#945;-MoO3"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A planar polariton focusing device based on the natural in-plane hyperbolic van der Waals material &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is developed, which achieves ultrahigh field compression and wide-range tunable performance. Moreover, a graphene/&#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; heterostructure is constructed, which supports hybrid modes consisting of &#945;-MoO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phonon polaritons and graphene plasmons to achieve in situ dynamical control of the focal length.

&lt;/p&gt;

Lead Telluride Nanoparticles
Lead telluride nanoparticles spontaneously assemble into a spanning nanofiber network as reported by Nicholas A. Kotov and co&#8208;workers in article number 2201313. The resulting transparent nanoparticle hydrogels have potential application as UV or X&#8208;ray sensors. The network morphology can be modified through variations in the composition and concentration of added electrolyte. Evaluation of the network morphology with graph theory is used to derive correlations to the gels' mechanical and electrical properties.

Dendrimer Emitters
In article number 2110344, Dianming Sun, Xiaohong Zhang, Anna K&#246;hler, Eli Zysman&#8208;Colman, and co&#8208;workers report the rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimer emitters that show remarkable photophysical properties, resolving the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small activation energy and a large oscillator strength. Their use in a host&#8208;free solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED), which shows record&#8208;high external quantum efficiencies, is demonstrated.

&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dendrimer Emitters&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202110344"&gt;2110344&lt;/a&gt;, Dianming Sun, Xiaohong Zhang, Anna K&#246;hler, Eli Zysman-Colman, and co-workers report the rational design of thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) dendrimer emitters that show remarkable photophysical properties, resolving the conflicting requirements of achieving simultaneously a small activation energy and a large oscillator strength. Their use in a host-free solution-processed organic light-emitting diode (OLED), which shows record-high external quantum efficiencies, is demonstrated. The dendrimer design strategy provides a route to high-performance solution-processed TADF OLEDs and evidences the full potential of dendrimers as emissive materials.

Biohybrid Robots
The next robotics frontier will be led by biohybrids, robots that incorporate living biological cells and tissue, which are addressed by Miriam Filippi, Robert K. Katzschmann, and co&#8208;workers in article number 2108427. Microfluidics substantially contributes to the development of biological tissue in vitro, as microfluidic flow control enables fluid regulation at the microscale and fine tissue structuring during biofabrication. Microfluidics will advance the co&#8208;assembly, scale&#8208;up, and integration of biohybrid robots, and make these robots performant and functional for real&#8208;world use.

         <title>Surface Modification of 2D Photocatalysts for Solar Energy Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Although the research of 2D photocatalysts has made great progress in the past decades, there are still many challenges in understanding the deep relationship between the surface state and the reaction mechanism. The surface modification strategies and reaction mechanisms of 2D photocatalysts are reviewed, and some useful views are put forward for future research in this field.








Abstract
2D materials show many particular properties, such as high surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio, high anisotropic degree, and adjustable chemical functionality. These unique properties in 2D materials have sparked immense interest due to their applications in photocatalytic systems, resulting in significantly enhanced light capture, charge&#8208;transfer kinetics, and surface reaction. Herein, the research progress in 2D photocatalysts based on varied compositions and functions, followed by specific surface modification strategies, is introduced. Fundamental principles focusing on light harvesting, charge separation, and molecular adsorption/activation in the 2D&#8208;material&#8208;based photocatalytic system are systemically explored. The examples described here detail the use of 2D materials in various photocatalytic energy&#8208;conversion systems, including water splitting, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, hydrogen peroxide production, and organic synthesis. Finally, by elaborating the challenges and possible solutions for developing these 2D&#160;materials, the review is expected to provide some inspiration for the future research of 2D materials used on efficient photocatalytic energy conversions.

         <title>Microfluidic Tissue Engineering and Bio&#8208;Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microfluidics enables the engineering of biological tissues through micro&#8208;precision control over the cell microenvironment, fabrication of cell&#8208;laden matrices, and distribution of fluids to perfuse 3D tissue constructs. In particular, microfluidically&#8208;advanced functional muscle tissues can be used as performant actuators in the next generation of bio&#8208;hybrid robots.








Abstract
Bio&#8208;hybrid technologies aim to replicate the unique capabilities of biological systems that could surpass advanced artificial technologies. Soft bio&#8208;hybrid robots consist of synthetic and living materials and have the potential to self&#8208;assemble, regenerate, work autonomously, and interact safely with other species and the environment. Cells require a sufficient exchange of nutrients and gases, which is guaranteed by convection and diffusive transport through liquid media. The functional development and long&#8208;term survival of biological tissues in vitro can be improved by dynamic flow culture, but only microfluidic flow control can develop tissue with fine structuring and regulation at the microscale. Full control of tissue growth at the microscale will eventually lead to functional macroscale constructs, which are needed as the biological component of soft bio&#8208;hybrid technologies. This review summarizes recent progress in microfluidic techniques to engineer biological tissues, focusing on the use of muscle cells for robotic bio&#8208;actuation. Moreover, the instances in which bio&#8208;actuation technologies greatly benefit from fusion with microfluidics are highlighted, which include: the microfabrication of matrices, biomimicry of cell microenvironments, tissue maturation, perfusion, and vascularization.

         <title>Tuning Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen&#8208;Reduction Pathways for H2O2 Electrosynthesis via Engineering Atomically Dispersed Single Metal Site Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 23, June 9, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Engineering atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts in surface functionalization, coordination environments, and local carbon structures can effectively tune two&#8208;electron oxygen&#8208;reduction pathways for efficient hydrogen peroxide production. The review summarizes recent progress on catalyst development and electrode design to electrolyzer fabrication for clean and sustainable hydrogen peroxide electrosynthesis.








Abstract
The hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) generation via the electrochemical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) under ambient conditions is emerging as an alternative and green strategy to the traditional energy&#8208;intensive anthraquinone process and unsafe direct synthesis using H2 and O2. It enables on&#8208;site and decentralized H2O2 production using air and renewable electricity for various applications. Currently, atomically dispersed single metal site catalysts have emerged as the most promising platinum group metal (PGM)&#8208;free electrocatalysts for the ORR. Further tuning their central metal sites, coordination environments, and local structures can be highly active and selective for H2O2 production via the 2e&#8722; ORR. Herein, recent methodologies and achievements on developing single metal site catalysts for selective O2 to H2O2 reduction are summarized. Combined with theoretical computation and advanced characterization, a structure&#8211;property correlation to guide rational catalyst design with a favorable 2e&#8722; ORR process is aimed to provide. Due to the oxidative nature of H2O2 and the derived free radicals, catalyst stability and effective solutions to improve catalyst tolerance to H2O2 are emphasized. Transferring intrinsic catalyst properties to electrode performance for viable applications always remains a grand challenge. The key performance metrics and knowledge during the electrolyzer development are, therefore, highlighted.

Abstract
Aqueous rechargeable zinc&#8208;iodine batteries (ZIBs), including zinc&#8208;iodine redox flow batteries and static ZIBs, are promising candidates for future grid&#8208;scale electrochemical energy storage. They are safe with great theoretical capacity, high energy, and power density. Nevertheless, to make aqueous rechargeable ZIBs practically feasible, there are quite a few hurdles that need to be overcome, including self&#8208;discharge, sluggish kinetics, low energy density, and instability of Zn metal anodes. This article first reviews the electrochemistry in aqueous rechargeable ZIBs, including the flow and static battery configurations and their electrode reactions. Then the authors discuss the fundamental questions of ZIBs and highlight the key strategies and recent accomplishments in tackling the challenges. Last, they share their thoughts on the future research development in aqueous rechargeable ZIBs.

         <title>Magnetic Alignment for Plasmonic Control of Gold Nanorods Coated with Iron Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Plasmonic nanoparticles that can be manipulated with magnetic fields are of interest for advanced optical applications, diagnostics, imaging, and therapy. Alignment of gold nanorods yields strong polarization&#8208;dependent extinction, and use of magnetic fields is appealing because they act through space and can be quickly switched. In this work, cationic polyethyleneimine&#8208;functionalized superparamagnetic Fe3O4 nanoparticles (NPs) are deposited on the surface of anionic gold nanorods coated with bovine serum albumin. The magnetic gold nanorods (MagGNRs) obtained through mixing maintain the distinct optical properties of plasmonic gold nanorods that are minimally perturbed by the magnetic overcoating. Magnetic alignment of MagGNRs arising from magnetic dipolar interactions on the anisotropic gold nanorod core is comprehensively characterized, including structural characterization and enhancement (suppression) of the longitudinal surface plasmon resonance and suppression (enhancement) of the transverse surface plasmon resonance for light polarized parallel (orthogonal) to the magnetic field. MagGNRs can also be driven in rotating magnetic fields to rotate at frequencies of at least 17&#160;Hz. For suitably large gold nanorods (148&#160;nm long) and Fe3O4 NPs (13.4&#160;nm diameter), significant alignment is possible even in modest (&lt;500&#160;Oe) magnetic fields. An analytical model provides a unified understanding of the magnetic alignment of MagGNRs.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Mixing Enhanced Proximity Effect in Aluminum&#8208;Based Superconductor&#8208;Semiconductor Hybrids</title>

Abstract
In superconducting quantum circuits, aluminum is one of the most widely used materials. It is currently also the superconductor of choice for the development of topological qubits. In this application, however, aluminum&#8208;based devices suffer from poor magnetic field compatibility. In this article, we&#160;resolve this limitation by showing that adatoms of heavy elements (e.g. platinum) increase the critical field of thin aluminum films by more than a factor of two. Using tunnel junctions, we&#160;show that the increased field resilience originates from spin&#8208;orbit scattering introduced by Pt. we&#160;exploit this property in the context of the superconducting proximity effect in semiconductor&#8208;superconductor hybrids, where we&#160;show that InSb nanowires strongly coupled to Al/Pt films can maintain superconductivity up to 7&#160;T. The two&#8208;electron charging effect, a fundamental requirement for topological quantum computation, is shown to be robust against the presence of heavy adatoms. Additionally, we&#160;use non&#8208;local spectroscopy in a three&#8208;terminal geometry to probe the bulk of hybrid devices, showing that it remains free of sub&#8208;gap states. Finally, we&#160;demonstrate that semiconductor states which are proximitized by Al/Pt films maintain their ability to Zeeman&#8208;split in an applied magnetic field. Combined with the chemical stability and well&#8208;known fabrication routes of aluminum, Al/Pt emerges as the natural successor to Al&#8208;based systems and is a compelling alternative to other superconductors, whenever high&#8208;field resilience is&#160;required.

         <title>Geometric Phase and Localized Heat Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Many unusual wave phenomena in artificial structures are governed by their topological properties. However, the topology of diffusion remains almost unexplored. One reason is that diffusion is fundamentally different from wave propagation because of its purely dissipative nature. The other is that the diffusion field is mostly composed of modes that extend over wide ranges, making it difficult to be rendered within the tight&#8208;binding theory as commonly employed in wave physics. Here, we overcome the above challenges and perform systematic studies on the topology of heat diffusion. Based on a continuum model, we analytically obtain the band structure and geometric phase without using the tight&#8208;binding approximation. A deterministic parameter is found to link the geometric phase with the edge state, thereby proving the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence for heat diffusion. We experimentally demonstrate the topological edge state as localized heat diffusion and verify its dependence on the boundary conditions. Our approach is general, rigorous, and able to reveal rich knowledge about the system with great accuracy. The findings set up a solid foundation to explore the topology in novel thermal management applications.

         <title>Rhombohedral Pd&#8208;Sb Nanoplate with Pd&#8208;Terminated Surface: An Efficient Bifunctional Fuel Cell Catalyst</title>

Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance electrocatalysts for both ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is essential for the commercialization of direct ethanol fuel cells (DEFCs), but it is still formidable challenging. Herein, for the first time we have successfully prepared a novel Pd&#8208;Sb hexagonal nanoplate for boosting both cathodic and anodic fuel cell reactions. Detailed structural characterizations reveal that the nanoplates have ordered rhombohedral phase of Pd8Sb3 (denoted as Pd8Sb3 HPs) with Pd&#8208;terminated surface. Significantly, the unique Pd8Sb3 HPs can exhibit much enhanced activity towards the oxidation of various alcohols in alkaline media. In particular, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C displays superior specific and mass activities of 29.3&#160;mA cm&#8211;2 and 4.5 A mgPd&#8211;1 towards EOR, which are 7.0 and 11.3 times higher than those of commercial Pd/C, and 9.8 and 3.8 times higher than those of commercial Pt/C, respectively, representing one of the best EOR catalysts reported to date. In&#8208;situ electrochemical ATR&#8208;SEIRAS measurements reveal that Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can effectively promote the C2 pathway of EOR, which is the key to the improved activity. As further disclosed by the density functional theory calculations, the higher EOR intrinsic catalytic activity of Pd8Sb3 HPs can be ascribed to the reduced energy barrier of ethanol dehydrogenation. In addition, Pd8Sb3 HPs/C can also show superior performance to both commercial Pd/C and Pt/C in cathodic ORR. This work advances the controllable synthesis of Pd&#8208;Sb nanostructure, which give huge impetus to the design of high&#8208;efficiency bifunctional electrocatalysts for energy conversion and beyond.

         <title>Designing a Redox Heterojunction for Photocatalytic &#8220;Overall Nitrogen Fixation&#8221; under Mild Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In a heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in different components, realizing synchronous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products&#8212;photocatalytic &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation&#8221; reactions.








Abstract
Ammonia and nitrates are the most fundamental and significant raw ingredients in human society. Till now, industrial synthetic ammonia by Haber&#8211;Bosch process and industrial synthetic nitrates by the Ostwald process have encountered increasingly serious challenges, i.e., high energy consumption, high cost, and environment&#8208;harmful gas emissions. Therefore, developing alternative approaches to achieve nitrogen fixation to overcome the inherent deficiencies of the well&#8208;established Haber&#8211;Bosch and Ostwald processes has fascinated scientists for many years, especially the simultaneous formation of ammonia and nitrate directly from N2 molecules, which has been rarely studied. Herein, a heterojunction&#8208;based photocatalytic system is designed to successfully achieve &#8220;overall nitrogen fixation,&#8221; a sustainable and simultaneous conversion of N2 molecules into ammonia and nitrate products under mild conditions. In this heterojunction, interfacial charge redistribution (ICR) promotes selective accumulations of photogenerated electrons and holes in the CdS and WO3 components. As a result, N2 molecules can be activated and reduced to ammonia products with yields of 35.8&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a multi&#8208;electron process, and synchronously oxidized into nitrate products with yields of 14.2&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 by a hole&#8208;induced oxidation coupling process. This work provides a novel insight and promising approach to realize artificial nitrogen fixation under mild condition.

         <title>Doping Compensation Enables High&#8208;Detectivity Infrared Organic Photodiodes for Image Sensing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A doping compensation strategy is utilized to reduce the trap density and to enhance the external quantum efficiency simultaneously, leading to a greatly improved detectivity in infrared organic photodiodes. Consequently, high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density organic photodiodes arrays without pattering sensing layers are successfully applied in image capture.








Abstract
Infrared organic photodiodes have gained increasing attention due to their great application potentials in night vision, optical communication, and all&#8208;weather imaging. However, the commonly occurring high dark current and low detectivity impede infrared photodetectors from portable applications at room temperature. Herein, an efficient and generic doping compensation strategy is developed to improve the detectivity of infrared organic photodiodes. A series of n&#8208;type organic semiconductors is investigated, and it is found that doping compensation strategy not only reduces the trap density of states and dark currents, but also restrains the nonradiative recombination with improved charge transport and collection. As a result, an ultralow noise spectral density of 8&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;15 A Hz&#8722;1/2 as well as a high specific detectivity over 1013 Jones in 780&#8211;1070&#160;nm is achieved at room temperature. More importantly, the high&#8208;performance infrared organic photodiodes can be successfully applied in high&#8208;pixel&#8208;density image arrays without patterning sensing layers. These findings provide important compensation design insights that will be crucial to further improve the performance of infrared organic photodiodes in the future.

         <title>Observation of Topological Edge States in Thermal Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The topological band theory predicts that bulk materials with nontrivial topological phases support topological edge states. This phenomenon is universal for various wave systems and has been widely observed for electromagnetic and acoustic waves. Here, we extend the notion of band topology from wave to diffusion dynamics. Unlike the wave systems that are usually Hermitian, the diffusion systems are anti&#8208;Hermitian with purely imaginary eigenvalues corresponding to decay rates. Via direct probe of the temperature diffusion, we experimentally retrieve the Hamiltonian of a thermal lattice, and observe the emergence of topological edge decays within the gap of bulk decays. Our results show that such edge states exhibit robust decay rates, which are topologically protected against disorders. This work constitutes a thermal analogue of topological insulators and paves the way to exploring defect&#8208;immune heat dissipation.

         <title>A Sparse and Spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based Adaptive Photo Encoder for Augmenting Machine Vision for Spiking Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Representation of external stimuli in the form of action potentials or spikes constitute the basis of energy efficient neural computation that emerging spiking neural networks (SNNs) aspire to imitate. With recent evidence suggesting that information in the brain is more often represented by explicit firing times of the neurons rather than mean firing rates, it is imperative to develop novel hardware that can accelerate sparse and spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding. Here we introduce a medium scale integrated (MSI) circuit comprised of two cascaded three&#8208;stage inverters and one XOR logic gate fabricated using a total of 21 memtransistors based on photosensitive two&#8208;dimensional (2D) monolayer MoS2 for spike&#8208;timing&#8208;based encoding of visual information. We show that different illumination intensities can be encoded into sparse spiking with time&#8208;to&#8208;first&#8208;spike representing the illumination information, i.e., higher intensities invoke earlier spikes and vice versa. In addition, non&#8208;volatile and analog programmability in our photo encoder is exploited for adaptive photo encoding that allows expedited spiking under scotopic (low&#8208;light) and deferred spiking under photopic (bright&#8208;light) conditions, respectively. Finally, low energy expenditure of less than 1 &#956;J by the 2D memtransistor&#8208;based photo encoder highlights the benefits in&#8208;sensor and bio&#8208;inspired design that can be transformative for the acceleration of SNNs.

         <title>Uneven Stripping Behavior, A killer of Mg Anode in Mist</title>

Abstract
Uniform magnesium (Mg) plating/striping under high areal capacity utilization is critical for the practical application of Mg metal anode in rechargeable Mg batteries. However, the Mg metal anode failure has raising concerns when cycling under practical areal capacity (&gt; 4&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . The mechanism behind these failures remains controversial. In this work, we illustrate that the initial plating Mg can be undoubtedly uniform in wide range of current densities (&#8804; 5&#160;mA cm&#8211;2) and under a practical areal capacity (6&#160;mA h cm&#8211;2) . However, an unusual self&#8208;accelerating pit growth is observed in the Mg stripping side under the moderate current densities (0.1&#8208;1&#160;mA cm&#8211;2), which severely deteriorates the anode integrity and subsequent Mg plating uniformity, causing Mg metal anode failure or short circuit of battery. The stripping morphology depends on the applied current density, as non&#8208;uniformity versus the current density displays a volcano plot during the stripping process. Through in&#8208;situ spectroscopy, we illustrate that this current dependent behavior is determined by the evolution of chlorine&#8208;containing complex ions near the interface. This research reminds that the plating/stripping process of Mg metal anode must be considered comprehensively for the practical Mg metal batteries.

         <title>Euryhaline&#8208;Fish&#8208;Inspired Salinity Self&#8208;adaptive Nanofluidic Diode Leads to High Performance Blue Energy Harvester</title>

Abstract
The adaptability to wide salinities remains a big challenge for artificial nanofluidic systems, which plays a vital role in water&#8208;energy nexus science. Here, inspired by euryhaline fishes, we construct sandwich&#8208;structured nanochannel systems to realize salinity self&#8208;adaptive nanofluidic diodes which lead to high performance salinity gradient power generator with low internal resistance. Adaptive to changing salinity, pore morphology of one side of the nanochannel system switches from 1D straight nanochannel (45 nm) to 3D network pores (1.9 nm pore size and &#8764;1013 pore density), along with three orders of magnitude for charge density. Thus, abundant surface charge and narrow pores render the membrane&#8208;based osmotic power generator with power density up to 26.22 Wm&#8722;2. The salinity&#8208;adaptive membrane solves the surface charge shielding problem caused by abundant mobile ions in high salinity and increases the overlapping degree of electric double layer. The dynamic adaption process of the membrane to the hypersaline environment endows it with good salt endurance and stability. We demonstrate new routes for designing nanofluidic devices functionally adaptable to different salinities and building power generators with excellent salt endurance.

         <title>Intracellular Crowding by Bio&#8208;Orthogonal Hydrogel Formation Induces Reversible Molecular Stasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
To survive extreme conditions, certain animals enter a reversible protective stasis through vitrification of the cytosol by polymeric molecules such as proteins and polysaccharides. In this work, synthetic gelation of the cytosol in living cells is used to induce reversible molecular stasis. Through the sequential lipofectamine&#8208;mediated transfection of complementary poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) macromers into mammalian cells, intracellular crosslinking occurs through bio&#8208;orthogonal strain&#8208;promoted azide&#8208;alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) click reactions. This achieves efficient polymer uptake with minimal cell death (99% viable). Intracellular crosslinking decreases DNA replication, protein synthesis, and increases the quiescent population by 2.5&#8208;fold. Real&#8208;time tracking of single cells containing intracellular crosslinked polymers identifies increases in intermitotic time (15&#160;versus 19 h) and decreases in motility (30&#160;versus 15&#160;&#956;m/h). The cytosol viscosity increases 3&#8208;fold after intracellular crosslinking and results in disordered cytoskeletal structure in addition to the disruption of cellular coordination in a scratch assay. By incorporating photodegradable nitrobenzyl moieties into the polymer backbone, the effects of intracellular crosslinking are reversed upon exposure to light, thereby restoring proliferation (80% phospho&#8208;Rb+ cells), protein translation, and migration. Reversible intracellular crosslinking provides a novel method for dynamic manipulation of intracellular mechanics, altering essential processes that determine cellular function.

         <title>Reprogramming Mitochondrial Metabolism in Synovial Macrophages of Early Osteoarthritis by A Camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Osteoarthritis (OA) is a low&#8208;grade inflammatory and progressive joint disease, and its progression is closely associated with an imbalance in M1/M2 synovial macrophages. Repolarizing pro&#8208;inflammatory M1 macrophages into the anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 phenotype is emerging as a strategy to alleviate OA progression but is compromised by unsatisfactory efficiency. In this study, we pioneer the reprogramming of mitochondrial dysfunction with a camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensome, which can transform M1 synovial macrophages into the M2 phenotype with a high efficiency of 82.3%. The meta&#8208;Defensome recognizes activated macrophages via receptor&#8208;ligand interactions and accumulates in mitochondria through electrostatic attraction. These meta&#8208;Defensomes are macrophage membrane&#8208;coated polymeric nanoparticles decorated with dual ligands and co&#8208;loaded with S&#8208;methylisothiourea and MnO2. In vitro results indicate that the meta&#8208;Defensomes successfully reprogram mitochondrial metabolism of RAW 246.7&#8208;differentiated M1 macrophages by restoring aerobic respiration by scavenging mtROS and inhibiting mtNOS, thereby increasing TFAM expression. Furthermore, meta&#8208;Defensomes are intravenously injected into CIOA mice and effectively suppress synovial inflammation and progression of early OA, as evident from the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) score. Therefore, reprogramming mitochondrial metabolism can serve as a novel and practical approach to repolarize M1 synovial macrophages. The camouflaged meta&#8208;Defensomes are a promising therapeutic agent for impeding OA progression in clinical practice.

         <title>Fabrications of Topological Solitons Array in Patterned Chiral Liquid Crystals for Real&#8208;time Observation of Morphogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Topological solitons have knotted continuous field configurations embedded in a uniform background, which occur in cosmology, biology, and electromagnetism. However, real&#8208;time observation of their morphogenesis and dynamics is still challenging because their size and time scale are enormously large or tiny. Liquid crystal (LC) structures are promising candidates for model&#8208;system to study the morphogenesis of topological solitons, enabling direct visualization due to the proper size and time scale. Here, we find a way to rationalize the real&#8208;time observation of the generation and transformation of topological solitons using the cholesteric LC confined in the patterned substrates. Our experimental demonstration shows the topologically protected structures arise via the transformation of topological defects. Numerical modeling based on free energy minimization closely reconstructs our experimental findings. The fundamental insights obtained from direct observations pose new theoretical challenges in understanding the morphogenesis of different types of topological solitons within a broad range of scales.

         <title>Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high&#8208;performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.








Abstract
Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in&#8208;depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms.

     alt="Insights into Redox Processes and Correlated Performance of Organic Carbonyl Electrode Materials in Rechargeable Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic carbonyl compounds have been considered as promising electrode materials for high-performance rechargeable batteries. However, their redox processes and performance need to be fully understood. An in-depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided, with the aim of promoting their practical applications in the foreseeable future.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic carbonyl electrode materials have shown great prospects for rechargeable batteries in view of their high capacity, flexible designability, and sustainable production. However, organic carbonyl electrode materials still suffer from unsatisfactory electrochemical performance, which is highly relevant to their redox processes. Herein, an in-depth understanding on redox processes and the correlated electrochemical performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials is provided. The redox processes discussed mainly involve molecular structure evolution (intermediates), crystal structure evolution (phase transition), and charge storage mechanisms. The properties of intermediates can affect voltage, cycling stability, reversible capacity, and rate performance of batteries. Moreover, the reversible capacity/cycling stability and rate performance would be also influenced by phase transition and charge storage mechanisms (diffusion- or surface-controlled), respectively. To accelerate the practical applications of organic carbonyl electrode materials, future work should focus on developing more in situ or operando characterization techniques and further understanding the intrinsic relationships between redox processes and performance. It is hoped that the work discussed herein will stimulate more attention to the detailed redox processes and their correlations with the performance of organic carbonyl electrode materials in rechargeable batteries.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Polyelectrolytes: Underexplored Materials for Pseudocapacitive Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugated polyelectrolytes are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. Moreover, that conjugated polyelectrolytes are miscible in aqueous media enables living materials that can switch from energy production to energy storage.








Abstract
Conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPEs) are characterized by an electronically delocalized backbone bearing ionic functionalities. These features lead to properties relevant for use in energy&#8208;storing pseudocapacitor devices, including ionic conductivity, water processability, gel&#8208;formation, and formation of polaronic species stabilized by electrostatic interactions. In this Perspective, the basis for evaluating the figures of merit for pseudocapacitors is provided, together with the techniques used for their evaluation. The general utility and challenges encountered with neutral conjugated polymers are then discussed. Finally, recent advances on the use of CPEs in pseudocapacitor devices are reviewed. The article is concluded by discussing how their miscibility in aqueous media permits the incorporation of CPEs in living materials that are capable of switching function from extraction of energy from bacterial metabolic pathways to pseudocapacitor energy storage.

         <title>Assessing the Photovoltaic Quality of Vacuum&#8208;Thermal Evaporated Organic Semiconductor Blends</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art vacuum thermal&#8208;evaporated organic solar cells (VTE OSCs) in their photovoltaic material quality is assessed. The comprehensive optoelectronic characterization yields four key metrics governing OSC performance&#8212;a new methodology that equally applies to solution&#8208;processed OSCs. The five studied material blends give a representative overview of today's VTE OSCs and needs for improvement are identified for this industrially leading OSC technology.








Abstract
Vacuum&#8208;thermal evaporation (VTE) is a highly relevant fabrication route for organic solar cells (OSCs), especially on an industrial scale as proven by the commercialization of organic light emitting diode&#8208;based displays. While OSC performance is reported for a range of VTE&#8208;deposited molecules, a comprehensive assessment of donor:acceptor blend properties with respect to their photovoltaic performance is scarce. Here, the organic thin films and solar cells of three select systems are fabricated and ellipsometry, external quantum efficiency with high dynamic range, as well as OTRACE are measured to quantify absorption, voltage losses, and charge carrier mobility. These parameters are key to explain OSC performance and will help to rationalize the performance of other material systems reported in literature as the authors&#8217; methodology is applicable beyond VTE systems. Furthermore, it can help to judge the prospects of new molecules in general. The authors find large differences in the measured values and find that today's VTE OSCs can reach high extinction coefficients, but only moderate mobility and voltage loss compared to their solution&#8208;processed counterparts. What needs to be improved for VTE OSCs is outlined to again catch up with their solution&#8208;processed counterparts in terms of power conversion efficiency.

         <title>Tuning Conjugated Polymer Chain Packing for Stretchable Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Bulky additive molecules residing between amorphous chain networks can disrupt the crystalline ordering of polymer semiconductors. The long&#8208;range crystalline domains are suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, leading to an improved thin&#8208;film stretchability without affecting charge transport under an external strain up to 100%.








Abstract
In order to apply polymer semiconductors to stretchable electronics, they need to be easily deformed under strain without being damaged. A small number of conjugated polymers, typically with semicrystalline packing structures, have been reported to exhibit mechanical stretchability. Herein, a method is reported to modify polymer semiconductor packing&#8208;structure using a molecular additive, dioctyl phthalate (DOP), which is found to act as a molecular spacer, to be inserted between the amorphous chain networks and disrupt the crystalline packing. As a result, large&#8208;crystal growth is suppressed while short&#8208;range aggregations of conjugated polymers are promoted, which leads to an improved mechanical stretchability without affecting charge&#8208;carrier transport. Due to the reduced conjugated polymer intermolecular interactions, strain&#8208;induced chain alignment and crystallization are observed. By adding DOP to a well&#8208;known conjugated polymer, poly[2,5&#8208;bis(4&#8208;decyltetradecyl)pyrrolo[3,4&#8208;c]pyrrole&#8208;1,4&#8208;(2H,5H)&#8208;dione&#8208;(E)&#8208;1,2&#8208;di(2,2&#8242;&#8208;bithiophen&#8208;5&#8208;yl)ethene] (DPPTVT), stretchable transistors are obtained with anisotropic charge&#8208;carrier mobilities under strain, and stable current output under strain up to 100%.

         <title>Controlled n&#8208;Doping of Naphthalene&#8208;Diimide&#8208;Based 2D Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The bulk conductivity of naphthalene&#8208;diimide&#8208;based 2D polymers is increased by controlled stoichiometric n&#8208;doping with cobaltocene. Following single&#8208;electron reduction, these 2DPs retain their periodic structure and become paramagnetic. Substoichiometric doping leads to the highest bulk electronic conductivities, which is found to proceed through a hopping&#8208;mechanism.








Abstract
2D polymers (2DPs) are promising as structurally well&#8208;defined, permanently porous, organic semiconductors. However, 2DPs are nearly always isolated as closed shell organic species with limited charge carriers, which leads to low bulk conductivities. Here, the bulk conductivity of two naphthalene diimide (NDI)&#8208;containing 2DP semiconductors is enhanced by controllably n&#8208;doping the NDI units using cobaltocene (CoCp2). Optical and transient microwave spectroscopy reveal that both as&#8208;prepared NDI&#8208;containing 2DPs are semiconducting with sub&#8208;2&#160;eV optical bandgaps and photoexcited charge&#8208;carrier lifetimes of tens of nanoseconds. Following reduction with CoCp2, both 2DPs largely retain their periodic structures and exhibit optical and electron&#8208;spin resonance spectroscopic features consistent with the presence of NDI&#8208;radical anions. While the native NDI&#8208;based 2DPs are electronically insulating, maximum bulk conductivities of &gt;10&#8722;4&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 are achieved by substoichiometric levels of n&#8208;doping. Density functional theory calculations show that the strongest electronic couplings in these 2DPs exist in the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (&#960;&#8208;stacking) crystallographic directions, which indicates that cross&#8208;plane electronic transport through NDI stacks is primarily responsible for the observed electronic conductivity. Taken together, the controlled molecular doping is a useful approach to access structurally well&#8208;defined, paramagnetic, 2DP n&#8208;type semiconductors with measurable bulk electronic conductivities of interest for electronic or spintronic devices.

         <title>Developing the Nondevelopable: Creating Curved&#8208;Surface Electronics from Nonstretchable Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Curved&#8208;surface electronics promise to bring new levels of interactivity, sensitivity, and energy efficiency to our&#160;everyday lives. These curved shapes, however, pose a challenge to established fabrication methods for high&#8208;performance electronics. In this work, ultrathin, nonstretchable planar electronics are attached to nondevelopable surfaces by introducing a shrinkage&#8208;based wrinkling paradigm that can enable future curved devices to leverage developments in flexible electronics.








Abstract
The incorporation of electronics onto curved surfaces promises to bring new levels of intelligence to the ergonomic, aesthetic, aerodynamic, and optical surfaces that are ever&#8208;present in our&#160;lives. However, since many of these surfaces have 2D (i.e., nondevelopable) curvature, they cannot be formed from the deformation of a flat, nonstretchable sheet. This means that curved electronics cannot capitalize on the rapid technological advances taking place in the field of ultrathin electronics, since ultrathin devices, though ultraflexible, are not stretchable. In this work, a shrink&#8208;based paradigm is presented to apply such thin&#8208;film electronics to nondevelopable surfaces, expanding the capabilities of current nondevelopable electronics, and linking future developments in thin&#8208;film technology to similar developments in curved devices. The wrinkling of parylene&#8208;based devices and the effects of shrinkage on common electrical components are examined, culminating in shrinkable touch sensors and organic photovoltaics, laminated to various nondevelopable surfaces without loss of performance.

         <title>De Novo Synthesis of Free&#8208;Standing Flexible 2D Intercalated Nanofilm Uniform over Tens of cm2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded water network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported. The film can be laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The film is uniform over an area of 30 cm2, and shows electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending and proton conductivity up to 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Of a variety of intercalated materials, 2D intercalated systems have attracted much attention both as materials per se, and as a platform to study atoms and molecules confined among nanometric layers. High&#8208;precision fabrication of such structures has, however, been a difficult task using the conventional top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approaches. The de novo synthesis of a 3&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm intercalating a hydrogen&#8208;bonded network between two layers of fullerene molecules is reported here. The two&#8208;layered film can be further laminated into a multiply film either in situ or by sequential lamination. The 3 nm film forms uniformly over an area of several tens of cm2 at an air/water interface and can be transferred to either flat or perforated substrates. A free&#8208;standing film in air prepared by transfer to a gold comb electrode shows proton conductivity up to 1.4&#160;&#215; 10&#8722;4 S cm&#8722;1. Electron&#8208;dose&#8208;dependent reversible bending of a free&#8208;standing 6&#8208;nm&#8208;thick nanofilm hung in a vacuum is observed under electron beam irradiation.

         <title>14&#160;GHz Schottky Diodes Using a p&#8208;Doped Organic Polymer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Combining asymmetric co&#8208;planar nanogap electrodes with a p&#8208;doped organic polymer semiconductor yields Schottky diodes that are capable of operating at 14&#160;GHz, making them the fastest organic electronic devices reported to date.








Abstract
The low carrier mobility of organic semiconductors and the high parasitic resistance and capacitance often encountered in conventional organic Schottky diodes hinder their deployment in emerging radio frequency (RF) electronics. Here, these limitations are overcome by combining self&#8208;aligned asymmetric nanogap electrodes (&#8776;25&#160;nm) produced by adhesion lithography, with a high mobility organic semiconductor, and RF Schottky diodes able to operate in the 5G frequency spectrum are demonstrated. C16IDT&#8208;BT is used, as the high hole mobility polymer, and the impact of p&#8208;doping on the diode performance is studied. Pristine C16IDT&#8208;BT&#8208;based diodes exhibit maximum intrinsic and extrinsic cutoff frequencies (fC) of &gt;100&#160;and 6&#160;GHz, respectively. This extraordinary performance is attributed to the planar nature of the nanogap channel and the diode's small junction capacitance (&lt;2&#160;pF). Doping of C16IDT&#8208;BT with the molecular p&#8208;dopant C60F48 improves the diode's performance further by reducing the series resistance resulting to intrinsic and extrinsic fC of &gt;100&#160;and &#8776;14&#160;GHz respectively, while the DC output voltage of an RF rectifier circuit increases by a tenfold. Our&#160;work highlights the importance of the planar nanogap architecture and paves the way for the use of organic Schottky diodes in large&#8208;area RF electronics of the future.

Combining interface assembly of 2D organic semiconductor crystal (2DOSCs) with a poly(dimethylsiloxane)&#8208;mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique, large&#8208;area, high&#8208;resolution (1271 dpi), and layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated. OFETs based on the 2DOSC arrays show high electrical performance and a small relative variation of 12.5% in mobility. This method will promote the research and application of 2DOSCs.








Abstract
2D organic semiconductor crystals (2DOSCs) have extraordinary charge transport capability, adjustable photoelectric properties, and superior flexibility, and have stimulated continuous research interest for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic applications. The prerequisite for achieving large&#8208;area and high&#8208;throughput optoelectronic device integration is to fabricate high&#8208;resolution 2DOSC arrays. Patterned substrate&#8208; and template&#8208;assisted self&#8208;assembly is an effective strategy to fabricate OSC arrays. However, the film thickness is difficult to control due to the complicated crystallization process during solvent evaporation. Therefore, the manufacturing of 2DOSC arrays with high&#8208;resolution and controllable molecular&#8208;layer numbers through solution&#8208;based patterning methods remains a challenge. Herein, a two&#8208;step strategy to produce high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays is reported. First, large&#8208;scale 2DOSCs with well&#8208;defined layer numbers are obtained by a solution&#8208;processed organic semiconductor crystal engineering method. Next, the high&#8208;resolution layer&#8208;controlled 2DOSC arrays are fabricated by a polydimethylsiloxane mold&#8208;assisted selective contact evaporation printing technique. The organic field&#8208;effect transistors (OFETs) based on 2DOSC arrays have high electrical performance and excellent uniformity. The 2,6&#8208;bis(4&#8208;hexylphenyl)anthracene 2DOSC arrays&#8208;based OFETs have a small variation of 12.5% in mobility. This strategy can be applied to various organic semiconductors and pattern arrays. These demonstrations will offer more opportunities for 2DOSCs for integrated optoelectronic devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Ion&#8208;Exchange Doping of Conducting Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
An extremely efficient ion&#8208;exchange doping process for conjugated polymers which enables conductivities exceeding 1000 S cm&#8722;1 is demonstrated. Factors which affect ion exchange, such as electrolyte concentration, doping solvent, and film crystallinity are discussed. When exchange is efficient there is a direct correspondence between ion exchange electrochemical doping, which is used to reveal the detrimental impact of off&#8208;target oxidation reactions.








Abstract
Molecular doping&#8212;the use of redox&#8208;active small molecules as dopants for organic semiconductors&#8212;has seen a surge in research interest driven by emerging applications in sensing, bioelectronics, and thermoelectrics. However, molecular doping carries with it several intrinsic problems stemming directly from the redox&#8208;active character of these materials. A recent breakthrough was&#160;a doping technique based on ion&#8208;exchange, which separates the redox and charge compensation steps of the doping process. Here, the equilibrium and kinetics of ion exchange doping in a model system, poly(2,5&#8208;bis(3&#8208;alkylthiophen&#8208;2&#8208;yl)thieno(3,2&#8208;b)thiophene) (PBTTT) doped with FeCl3 and an ionic liquid, is studied, reaching conductivities in excess of 1000 S cm&#8722;1 and ion exchange efficiencies above 99%. Several factors that enable such high performance, including the choice of acetonitrile as the doping solvent, which largely eliminates electrolyte association effects and dramatically increases the doping strength of FeCl3, are demonstrated. In this high ion exchange efficiency regime, a simple connection between electrochemical doping and ion exchange is illustrated, and it is shown that the performance and stability of highly doped PBTTT is ultimately limited by intrinsically poor stability at high redox potential.

         <title>Short Excited&#8208;State Lifetimes Mediate Charge&#8208;Recombination Losses in Organic Solar Cell Blends with Low Charge&#8208;Transfer Driving Force</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells that employ donor:acceptor blends with near&#8208;zero driving force for charge transfer are becoming prevalent because of their superior performance. In this work, the factors affecting charge transfer and subsequent dissociation of the charge&#8208;transfer state are experimentally and theoretically analyzed. Short excited&#8208;state lifetime and hybridization open up new recombination channels with detrimental effects on free&#8208;charge generation.








Abstract
A blend of a low&#8208;optical&#8208;gap diketopyrrolopyrrole polymer and a fullerene derivative, with near&#8208;zero driving force for electron transfer, is investigated. Using femtosecond transient absorption and electroabsorption spectroscopy, the charge transfer (CT) and recombination dynamics as well as the early&#8208;time transport are quantified. Electron transfer is ultrafast, consistent with a Marcus&#8211;Levich&#8211;Jortner description. However, significant charge recombination and unusually short excited (S1) and CT state lifetimes (&#8776;14&#160;ps) are observed. At low S1&#8211;CT offset, a short S1 lifetime mediates charge recombination because: i) back&#8208;transfer from the CT to the S1 state followed by S1 recombination occurs and ii) additional S1&#8211;CT hybridization decreases the CT lifetime. Both effects are confirmed by density functional theory calculations. In addition, relatively slow (tens of picoseconds) dissociation of charges from the CT state is observed, due to low local charge mobility. Simulations using a four&#8208;state kinetic model entailing the effects of energetic disorder reveal that the free charge yield can be increased from the observed 12% to 60% by increasing the S1 and CT lifetimes to 150&#160;ps. Alternatively, decreasing the interfacial CT state disorder while increasing bulk disorder of free charges enhances the yield to 65% in spite of the short lifetimes.

         <title>Temperature&#8208;Triggered Supramolecular Assembly of Organic Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly process is reported for fabricating highly ordered organic semiconductor arrays. The central concept of the molecule design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy"&#8212;is to increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, thereby inducing conformation locking of adjacent molecules through cooperative [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions.

Abstract
Supramolecular assembly is a promising bottom&#8208;up approach for producing materials that behave as charge transporting components in electronic devices. Although extensive advances have been made during the past two decades, formidable challenges exist in controlling the local randomness present in supramolecular assemblies. Here, a temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly strategy using heat to heal defects and disorders is reported. The central concept of the molecular design&#8212;named the "Tetris strategy" in this research&#8212;is to: i) increase the rotational freedom of the molecules through thermal perturbation, ii) induce conformation&#8208;fitting of adjacent molecules through two different kinds of intermolecular [&#960;&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960;] interactions, and finally iii) lock the nearby molecules in inactive co&#8208;conformations. Experimentally, upon heating to 57&#160;&#176;C, amorphous solid&#8208;state films undergo spontaneous assembly, leading to the growth of uniform and highly ordered microwire arrays. Temperature&#8208;triggered supramolecular assembly provides an approach closer to the precision control of assembled structures and presents with a broad canvas to work on in approaching a new generation of supramolecular electronics.

         <title>Oligoethylene Glycol Side Chains Increase Charge Generation in Organic Semiconductor Nanoparticles for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in nanoparticle photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency. Glycolation facilitates charge generation and suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in donor/acceptor nanoparticles. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation and H2 evolution.








Abstract
Organic semiconductor nanoparticles (NPs) composed of an electron donor/acceptor (D/A) semiconductor blend have recently emerged as an efficient class of hydrogen&#8208;evolution photocatalysts. It is demonstrated that using conjugated polymers functionalized with (oligo)ethylene glycol side chains in NP photocatalysts can greatly enhance their H2&#8208;evolution efficiency compared to their nonglycolated analogues. The strategy is broadly applicable to a range of structurally diverse conjugated polymers. Transient spectroscopic studies show that glycolation facilitates charge generation even in the absence of a D/A heterojunction, and further suppresses both geminate and nongeminate charge recombination in D/A NPs. This results in a high yield of photogenerated charges with lifetimes long enough to efficiently drive ascorbic acid oxidation, which is correlated with greatly enhanced H2&#8208;evolution rates in the glycolated NPs. Glycolation increases the relative permittivity of the semiconductors and facilitates water uptake. Together, these effects may increase the high&#8208;frequency relative permittivity inside the NPs sufficiently, to cause the observed suppression of exciton and charge recombination responsible for the high photocatalytic activities of the glycolated NPs.

         <title>Emissive Charge&#8208;Transfer States at Hybrid Inorganic/Organic Heterojunctions Enable Low Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination and High&#8208;Performance Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge&#8208;transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub&#8208;picowatt near&#8208;infrared light.








Abstract
Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT&#8208;4F, Y6, PC70BM, C70, C60) proceeds via emissive charge&#8208;transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all&#8208;organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT&#8208;exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non&#8208;radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non&#8208;radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost&#8208;effective near&#8208;IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&#8722;2) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&#8722;1/2) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 1013 Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high&#8208;performance opto&#8208;electronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;Efficient charge generation mediated by an emissive charge-transfer state is observed in hybrid heterojunctions comprising the inorganic semiconductor copper thiocyanate and common organic semiconductors. This enables the fabrication of solar cells with very low voltage losses and highly sensitive photodetectors that can detect sub-picowatt near-infrared light.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hybrid devices based on a heterojunction between inorganic and organic semiconductors have offered a means to combine the advantages of both classes of materials in optoelectronic devices, but, in practice, the performance of such devices has often been disappointing. Here, it is demonstrated that charge generation in hybrid inorganic&#8211;organic heterojunctions consisting of copper thiocyanate (CuSCN) and a variety of molecular acceptors (ITIC, IT-4F, Y6, PC&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;BM, C&lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;) proceeds via emissive charge-transfer (CT) states analogous to those found at all-organic heterojunctions. Importantly, contrary to what has been observed at previous organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunctions, the dissociation of the CT-exciton and subsequent charge separation is efficient, allowing the fabrication of planar photovoltaic devices with very low non-radiative voltage losses (0.21&#160;&#177; &#8197;0.02&#160;V). It is shown that such low non-radiative recombination enables the fabrication of simple and cost-effective near-IR (NIR) detectors with extremely low dark current (4 pA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and noise spectral density (3 fA Hz&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;) at no external bias, leading to specific detectivities at NIR wavelengths of just under 10&lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt; Jones, close to the performance of commercial silicon photodetectors. It is believed that this work demonstrates the possibility for hybrid heterojunctions to exploit the unique properties of both inorganic and organic semiconductors for high-performance opto-electronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intrinsic Linear Dichroism of Organic Single Crystals toward High&#8208;Performance Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
A superior organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is selected to develop polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors. High&#8208;quality DPA crystals exhibit strong anisotropic nature. Their photodetectors show remarkable polarization sensitivity with a dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. It is revealed that intrinsic linear dichroism is responsible for the observed polarization sensitivity. This work demonstrates the potential of developing efficient polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors for diverse applications.








Abstract
The ability to detect light in photodetectors is central to practical optoelectronic applications, which has been demonstrated in inorganic semiconductor devices. However, so far, the study of polarization&#8208;sensitive organic photodetectors, which have unique applications in flexible and wearable electronics, has not received much attention. Herein, the construction of polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors based on the single crystals of a superior optoelectronic organic semiconductor, 2,6&#8208;diphenyl anthracene (DPA), is demonstrated. The systematic characterization of two&#8208;dimensionally grown DPA crystals with various techniques definitely show their strong anisotropy in molecular vibration, optical reflectance and optical absorption. In terms of polarization sensitivity, DPA&#8208;crystal based photodetectors exhibit a linear dichroic ratio up to &#8776;1.9. Theoretical calculations confirm that intrinsic linear dichroism, originated from the anisotropic in&#8208;plane crystal structure, is responsible for the polarization sensitivity of DPA crystals. This work opens up a new door for exploiting organic semiconductors for developing highly compact polarization photodetectors and providing new functionalities in novel flexible optical and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable All&#8208;Fluorescent White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with a High External Quantum Efficiency Over 30% and Extended Device Lifetime</title>

Color&#8208;tunable white organic light&#8208;emitting diodes with hole&#8208;trapping thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence&#8208;sensitized emissions realize significant Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage coordinates and correlated&#160;color&#160;temperature shifts from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, with a reported maximum external quantum efficiency of 30.7% and long lifetime of over 20&#160;000 h at 80% of the initial luminance.








Abstract
White organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (WOLEDs) with high efficiencies and tunable colors attracts considerable interest from the industry and academia. Thermally activated delayed&#8208;fluorescence (TADF) emitters can revolutionize such WOLED devices; however, they still suffer from poor performances. In this study, an advanced double&#8208;emissive&#8208;layer device architecture capable of hole&#8208;trapping TADF&#8208;sensitized emissions is proposed to not only achieve a recombination zone shift for the tunable colors but also accelerate exciton emission dynamics for high efficiency and alleviated roll&#8208;off. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept WOLEDs exhibit significant shifts in their Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates and correlated color temperatures from (0.40, 0.47) and 4088 K at 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2 to (0.27, 0.33) and 9269 K at 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2. Additionally, the maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) reaches 30.7% and remains &gt;25%&#160;over a wide luminance range of 500&#8211;5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2, along with an extended LT80 of over 20&#160;000 h at an initial luminance of 100&#160;cd m&#8722;2. This is the first time that all&#8208;fluorescent WOLEDs have been used to realize an EQE exceeding 30%, thereby establishing a new benchmark in this field.

         <title>Molecular Oligothiophene&#8211;Fullerene Dyad Reaching Over 5% Efficiency in Single&#8208;Material Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
The novel structurally defined and covalently linked donor&#8211;acceptor dyad 4 is implemented into single&#8208;material organic solar cells as the essential ambipolar and photoactive layer. The combination of an oligothiophene donor and PC71BM fullerene as acceptor not only leads to enhanced 5.34% power conversion efficiency, but also to impressive long&#8208;term stability after 750 hours (one month) of continuous illumination.








Abstract
A novel donor&#8211;acceptor dyad, 4, in which the conjugated oligothiophene donor is covalently connected to fullerene PC71BM by a flexible alkyl ester linker, is synthesized and applied as photoactive layer in solution&#8208;processed single&#8208;material organic solar cells (SMOSCs). Excellent photovoltaic performance, including a high short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) of 13.56&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, is achieved, leading to a power conversion efficiency of 5.34% in an inverted cell architecture, which is substantially increased compared to other molecular single materials. Furthermore, dyad 4&#8208;based SMOSCs display excellent stability maintaining 96% of the initial performance after 750 h (one month) of continuous illumination and operation under simulated AM 1.5G irradiation. These results will strengthen the rational molecular design to further develop SMOSCs for potential industrial application.

Conformal Films
In article number 2106683, Kenjiro Fukuda, Takao Someya, and co&#8208;workers demonstrate how a variety of ultrathin, ultraflexible organic photovoltaics that differ in layout, active area, and active material can be laminated to glass spheres of different sizes using a thermally activated shrink film. The wrinkling pattern that occurs in these ultrathin sheets allows even nonstretchable devices to conform to surfaces with a 3D curvature.

Multiscale organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices. The intrinsic properties of OSs can be regulated through chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control.








Abstract
Currently, organic semiconductors (OSs) are widely used as active components in practical devices related to energy storage and conversion, optoelectronics, catalysis, and biological sensors, etc. To satisfy the actual requirements of different types of devices, chemical structure design and self&#8208;assembly process control have been synergistically performed. The morphology and other basic properties of multiscale OS components are governed on a broad scale from nanometers to macroscopic micrometers. Herein, the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design strategies for fabricating multiscale OSs are comprehensively reviewed. Related representative works are introduced, applications in practical devices are discussed, and future research directions are presented. Design strategies combining the advances in organic synthetic chemistry and supramolecular assembly technology perform an integral role in the development of a new generation of multiscale OSs.

         <title>Color&#8208;Tunable Supramolecular Luminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Supramolecular chemistry has provided a platform for the rational design of smart optical materials. Noncovalent bonding interactions, not only afford convenient and efficient approaches to fabricate emissive materials, but also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness. This review highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of color&#8208;tunable luminescent materials.








Abstract
Constructing multicolor photoluminescent materials with tunable properties is an attractive research objective on account of their abundant applications in materials science and biomedical engineering. By comparison with covalent synthesis, supramolecular chemistry has provided a more competitive and promising strategy for the production of organic materials and the regulation of their photophysical properties. By taking advantage of dynamic and reversible noncovalent bonding interactions, supramolecular strategies can, not only simplify the design and fabrication of organic materials, but can also endow them with dynamic reversibility and stimuli responsiveness, making it much easier to adjust the superstructures and properties of the materials. Occasionally, it is possible to introduce emergent properties into these materials, which are absent in their precursor compounds, broadening their potential applications. In an attempt to highlight the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art noncovalent strategies available for the construction of smart luminescent materials, an overview of color&#8208;tunable materials is presented in this Review, with the emphasis being placed on the examples drawn from host&#8211;guest complexes, supramolecular assemblies and crystalline materials. The noncovalent synthesis of room&#8208;temperature phosphorescent materials and the modulation of their luminescent properties are also described. Finally, future directions and scientific challenges in the emergent field of color&#8208;tunable supramolecular emissive materials are discussed.

         <title>Slip&#8208;Stacked J&#8208;Aggregate Materials for Organic Solar Cells and Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
J&#8208; and H&#8208;aggregates constitute archetype functional materials due to unique properties originating from exciton coupling. Here, a broader perspective on the origin of red&#8208;shifted absorption bands including intermolecular charge transfer&#8208;mediated J&#8208;coupling is provided. Further, important classes of dye aggregates with regard to the prevailing intermolecular couplings and their relevance for organic solar cells and photodetectors are analyzed.








Abstract
Dye&#8211;dye interactions affect the optical and electronic properties in organic semiconductor films of light harvesting and detecting optoelectronic applications. This review elaborates how to tailor these properties of organic semiconductors for organic solar cells (OSCs) and organic photodiodes (OPDs). While these devices rely on similar materials, the demands for their optical properties are rather different, the former requiring a broad absorption spectrum spanning from the UV over visible up to the near&#8208;infrared region and the latter an ultra&#8208;narrow absorption spectrum at a specific, targeted wavelength. In order to design organic semiconductors satisfying these demands, fundamental insights on the relationship of optical properties are provided depending on molecular packing arrangement and the resultant electronic coupling thereof. Based on recent advancements in the theoretical understanding of intermolecular interactions between slip&#8208;stacked dyes, distinguishing classical J&#8208;aggregates with predominant long&#8208;range Coulomb coupling from charge transfer (CT)&#8208;mediated or &#8208;coupled J&#8208;aggregates, whose red&#8208;shifts are primarily governed by short&#8208;range orbital interactions, is suggested. Within this framework, the relationship between aggregate structure and functional properties of representative classes of dye aggregates is analyzed for the most advanced OSCs and wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs, providing important insights into the rational design of thin&#8208;film optoelectronic materials.

         <title>Structures and Materials in Stretchable Electroluminescent Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review discusses the challenges in fabricating stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices, with focus on providing a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and introducing important techniques to fabricate the devices. The developments of stretchable transparent electrodes and EL materials relevant to intrinsically stretchable EL devices are described in detail.








Abstract
Stretchable electroluminescent (EL) devices are obtained by partitioning a large emission area into areas specifically for stretching and light&#8208;emission (island&#8211;bridge structure). Buckled and textile structures are also shown effective to combine the conventional light emitting diode fabrication with elastic substrates for structure&#8208;enabled stretchable EL devices. Meanwhile, intrinsically stretchable EL devices which are characterized with uniform stretchability down to microscopic scale are relatively less developed but promise simpler device structure and higher impact resistance. The challenges in fabricating intrinsically stretchable EL devices with high and robust performance are in many facets, including stretchable conductors, emissive materials, and compatible processes. For the stretchable transparent electrode, ionically conductive gel, conductive polymer coating, and conductor network in surface of elastomer are all proven useful. The stretchable EL materials are currently limited to conjugated polymers, conjugated polymers with surfactants and ionic conductors added to boost stretchability, and phosphor particles embedded in elastomer matrices. These emissive materials operate under different mechanisms, require different electrode materials and fabrication processes, and the corresponding EL devices face distinctive challenges. This review aims to provide a basic understanding of the materials meeting both the mechanical and electronic requirements and important techniques to fabricate the stretchable EL devices.

         <title>Acceptor Modulation Strategies for Improving the Electron Transport in High&#8208;Performance Organic Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review illustrates the significance of improving electron transport of semiconducting polymers. To improve the electron mobilities, acceptor modulation strategies are summarized and discussed. The introduction of electron&#8208;withdrawing groups into polymers is also involved. High&#8208;performance organic field&#8208;effect transistors are reviewed. The relationship between device performance and chemical structure, energy levels, molecular packing orientation, and processing condition is comprehensively discussed.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance ambipolar and electronic type semiconducting polymers are essential for fabricating various organic optoelectronic devices and complementary circuits. This review summarizes the strategies of improving the electron transport of semiconducting polymers via acceptor modulation strategies, which include the use of single, dual, triple, multiple, and all acceptors as well as the fusion of multiple identical acceptors to obtain new heterocyclic acceptors. To further improve the electron transport of semiconducting polymers, the introduction of strong electron&#8208;withdrawing groups can enhance the electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of donors and acceptors, thereby facilitating electron injection and suppressing hole accumulation. In addition, the relationships between the molecular structure, frontier molecular orbital energy levels, thin film morphology, microstructure, processing conditions, and device performances are also comprehensively discussed. Finally, the challenges encountered in this research area are proposed and the future outlook is presented.

         <title>Recent Progress in External&#8208;Stimulus&#8208;Responsive 2D Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the recent process of stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is summarized. The responsive behaviors and design strategies of these smart 2D COFs under physical or chemical stimuli are well described. Moreover, their applications in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed.








Abstract
Recently, smart 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs), combining the advantages of both inherent structure features and functional building blocks, have been demonstrated to show reversible changes in conformation, color, and luminescence in response to external stimuli. This review provides a summary on the recent progress of 2D COFs that are responsive to external stimuli such as metal ions, gas molecules, pH values, temperature, electricity, light, etc. Moreover, the responsive mechanisms and design strategies, along with the applications of these stimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs in chemical sensors and photoelectronic devices are also discussed. It is believed that this review would provide some guidelines for designing novel single&#8208;/multistimulus&#8208;responsive 2D COFs with controllable responsive behaviors for advanced photoelectronic applications.

         <title>Quinoxaline&#8208;Based D&#8211;A Copolymers for the Applications as Polymer Donor and Hole Transport Material in Polymer/Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent developments of the quinoxaline&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as polymer donor in polymer solar cells and as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells are reviewed.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) have achieved great progress recently, benefiting from the rapid development of narrow bandgap small molecule acceptors and wide bandgap conjugated polymer donors. Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A&#8208;unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D&#8208;unit and difluoro&#8208;quinoxalline A&#8208;unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron&#8208;deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A&#8208;unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions. In this review article, recent developments of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymer donors, including synthetic method of the Qx unit, backbone modulation, side chain optimization, and functional substitution of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, are summarized and discussed. Furthermore, the application of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers as hole transport material in perovskite solar cells (pero&#8208;SCs) is also introduced. The focus mainly on the molecular design strategies and structure&#8211;properties relationship of the Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers, aiming to provide a guideline for developing high&#8208;performance Qx&#8208;based D&#8211;A copolymers for the applications as donor in PSCs and as hole transport material in pero&#8208;SCs.

Among the polymer donors, the D&#8211;A copolymers with quinoxaline (Qx) as A-unit have received increasing attention since the report of the low-cost and high-performance D&#8211;A copolymer donor based on thiophene D-unit and difluoro-quinoxalline A-unit in 2018. In addition, the weak electron-deficient characteristic and the multiple substitution positions of the Qx unit make it an ideal A-unit in constructing the wide bandgap polymer donors with different functional substitutions.

         <title>Research Progress of Intramolecular &#960;&#8208;Stacked Small Molecules for Device Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 34, Issue 22, June 2, 2022. </description>
         <dc:description>
Unlike traditional covalent bond&#8208;connected conjugated molecules, &#960;&#8208;stacked small molecules have special advantages in organic semiconductors. This review mainly focuses on the research development of &#960;&#8208;stacked molecular systems and introduces the new characteristics brought by the special molecular configuration and its application in organic semiconductors.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors can be designed and constructed in &#960;&#8208;stacked structures instead of the conventional &#960;&#8208;conjugated structures. Through&#8208;space interaction (TSI) occurs in &#960;&#8208;stacked optoelectronic materials. Thus, unlike electronic coupling along the conjugated chain, the functional groups can stack closely to facilitate spatial electron communication. Using &#960;&#8208;stacked motifs, chemists and materials scientists can find new ways for constructing materials with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), circularly polarized luminescence (CPL), and room&#8208;temperature phosphorescence (RTP), as well as enhanced molecular conductance. Organic optoelectronic devices based on &#960;&#8208;stacked molecules have exhibited very promising performance, with some of them exceeding &#960;&#8208;conjugated analogues. Recently, reports on various organic &#960;&#8208;stacked structures have grown rapidly, prompting this review. Representative molecular scaffolds and newly developed &#960;&#8208;stacked systems could stimulate more attention on through&#8208;space charge transfer the well&#8208;known through&#8208;bond charge transfer. Finally, the opportunities and challenges for utilizing and improving particular materials are discussed. The previous achievements and upcoming prospects may provide new insights into the theory, materials, and devices in the field of organic semiconductors.
