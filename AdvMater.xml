         <title>Responsive Metasurface for Directional Control of Laser and Thermal Emission Dynamic Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multispectral&#8208;responsive metasurface simultaneously modulates directional laser reflection and dynamic infrared emissivity, enabling robust dual&#8208;band camouflage and dual&#8208;modal anti&#8208;counterfeiting. By synergistically integrating spatial and spectral control, this approach greatly expands capabilities for manipulating multiple physical parameters, providing a versatile approach for advanced information encryption, holography, and thermal management applications in complex scenarios.









Abstract
Responsive metasurfaces can efficiently control the propagation and spectral properties of electromagnetic (EM) waves, emerging as an attractive technology in energy and information fields. However, achieving non&#8208;interference manipulation of near&#8208;infrared (NIR) laser wavelength and mid&#8208;infrared (MIR) region with spatial and spectral responsive capabilities is a challenging and long&#8208;sought task for applications, such as multispectral adaptive camouflage and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. Here, a multispectral responsive metasurface is demonstrated that enables independent modulation of MIR thermal emission while maintaining robust, spatially directional control of NIR laser reflections. This metasurface simultaneously achieves superior ultralow specular reflectivity of 0.049 (0.8&#8211;1.2 &#181;m) and high thermal emission regulation capability of 0.51 (8&#8211;13 &#181;m), attributed to NIR reflection splitting and a photonically amplified metal&#8208;insulator transition, respectively. The metasurface's exceptional capability to realize temperature&#8208;invariant NIR laser and dynamic MIR camouflage is experimentally proved under significant fluctuating thermal environments, superior to existing laser&#8208;IR&#8208;compatible camouflage technologies. Dual&#8208;mode information anti&#8208;counterfeiting is further demonstrated through independent channels for detection angles and temperature responses. This work provides a new pathway for stimulus&#8208;responsive materials with spatial and spectral modulation toward diverse multispectral application scenarios.

         <title>Multifunctional Interfacial Molecular Bridging Strategy Enables Efficient and Stable Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy is proposed, for the first time, to address the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs by stabilizing the upper interface between perovskites and PCBM electron transport layer (ETL), passivating interfacial defects, and improving the energy band alignment.








Abstract
Interface engineering in inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) faces critical challenges arising from nonideal interfacial contact, defect accumulation, impeded carrier transport, and energy&#8208;level misalignment between the perovskite and electron transport layer, for example, phenyl&#8208;C61&#8208;butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM). These interfacial deficiencies collectively induce nonradiative recombination and degrade device stability. Herein, a multifunctional interfacial molecular bridging strategy using (benzhydrylthio)acetic acid (DSA) addresses the upper interfacial issues of inverted PSCs, achieving three synergistic roles. 1) Interfacial stabilization. A stable molecular&#8208;bridging layer is constructed with DSA at the perovskite/PCBM interface through carboxylate&#8211;Pb2&#8314; coordination bonds, along with &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions between DSA and PCBM. 2) Defect passivation. Multiple active sites in DSA molecules, such as thioether and carboxylic acid groups, can synchronously achieve chemical passivation with undercoordinated Pb2+ sites. 3) Energy band alignment: DSA induces n&#8208;type band bending through electron donation by the thioether, reducing the work function and enhancing the electron&#8208;extraction kinetics. As a result, DSA&#8208;treated devices achieve a champion power conversion efficiency of 26.08% along with an open&#8208;circuit voltage loss of only 53&#160;mV. Finally, the DSA&#8208;treated devices demonstrate remarkable operational stability, retaining 96% of the initial efficiency after being tracked at the maximum power point for 2000&#160;h.

         <title>Adaptive Epitaxy of C&#8208;Si&#8208;Ge&#8208;Sn: Customizable Bulk and Quantum Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work pushes the boundaries of epitaxy by achieving all&#8208;group&#8208;IV semiconductor heterostructures and extensive characterization. The alloys open new research topics in material properties investigation for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic device technologies.








Abstract
The successful demonstration of (Si)Ge1&#8208;xSnx alloys as direct&#8208;gap materials for infrared lasers has driven intense research on group IV&#8208;based devices for nanoelectronics, energy harvesting, and quantum computing applications. The material palette of direct&#8208;gap group&#8208;IV alloys can be further extended by introducing carbon to fine&#8208;tune their structural and electronic properties, significantly expanding their functionality. This work presents heteroepitaxial growth of C(Si)GeSn alloys using an industry&#8208;standard reduced&#8208;pressure chemical vapor deposition reactor. The introduction of CBr4 as a precursor enables controlled incorporation of C atoms (&lt;1 at.%) into the epilayer lattice, while simultaneously increasing the Sn content in the CGeSn alloy up to &#8776;18 at.%. Carbon plays a key role in modulating strain, stabilizing the crystal structure, and influencing material properties. By leveraging alloying and strain engineering, quaternary CSiGeSn bulk layers and CGeSn/GeSn heterostructures are epitaxially grown. The impact of C incorporation on optical emission is investigated in LEDs based on CGeSn/GeSn multiple quantum wells, demonstrating enhanced near&#8208;infrared emission at 2.54 &#181;m, which is sustained up to room temperature.

         <title>Smart Materials and Devices for Enhanced Delivery of Extracellular Vesicles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart materials and biomedical devices are increasingly used to overcome limitations in extracellular vesicle (EV) delivery. This review highlights recent advances in surface modification, exogenous and endogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive systems, and device&#8208;assisted strategies including scaffolds, microneedles, hydrogels, and microfluidic platforms, to achieve precise, efficient, and targeted EV&#8208;based therapeutic delivery.








Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are vesicle&#8208;like structures secreted by various cell types, playing a crucial role in cell communication. As an efficient and safe therapeutic carrier, EVs offer new insights and methods for disease treatment and drug development due to high stability, low immunogenicity, and broad resources. However, current applications on EV&#8208;based delivery systems are still challenging, and additional strategies are needed to achieve precise and targeted delivery, enhance stability and safety, and avoid unnecessary immune reactions or side effects. This review summarizes the latest progress in using smart materials or devices to enhance EV delivery, aiming to provide a reference for designing novel and efficient EV&#8208;based targeted delivery strategies.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Spin Transport in Chiral Gold</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is demonstrated that in chiral gold film, spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by the Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. The spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates spin effective lifetime on the order of nanoseconds.








Abstract
Any attempt to use spintronics&#8208;based logic elements will need to have spin interconnects to transfer information between its elements. Typically, the mean free path of an electron's spin in metals, at room temperature, is of the order of tens to hundreds of nanometers. Here chiral gold films are used to demonstrate that spin information can be transferred to distances of several microns at room temperature. The conduction of spins is accompanied by a Hall effect that exists without applying an external magnetic field. It is verified that the spin diffusion length is consistent with the frequency&#8208;dependent Hall effect which indicates a spin&#8208;effective lifetime in the order of nanoseconds. A theoretical model is presented that involves the anisotropic electronic polarizability of the system, its spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and spin exchange interactions.

A theoretical model is presented that involves the anisotropic electronic polarizability of the system, its spin&#8211;orbit coupling, and spin exchange interactions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Regulating Electron Transfer in Vanadium&#8208;Based Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks via the Synergy of Linker Engineering and Machine Learning for Efficient and Reversible Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a ligand&#8208;engineering strategy to construct a series of functionalized X&#8208;MIL(V)&#8208;47 framework materials, enabling a systematic elucidation of the synergistic mechanisms between surface functionalization and morphological features in enhancing the electrochemical performance of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. By integrating machine learning with advanced characterization techniques, the zinc&#8208;storage mechanism and the structural evolution during cycling are comprehensively revealed.








Abstract
Precise regulation of ligands in metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) to modulate the local electronic structure and charge distribution has become an effective strategy for optimizing their electrochemical performance. However, utilizing ligand&#8208;functionalized MOFs to activate their potential in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries remains a challenge. Herein, eight ligand&#8208;functionalized X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 (X represents the functional groups) samples are prepared using a one&#8208;pot solvothermal method. The polar substituents on the ligand regulated the electronic structure of the MOFs through inductive and conjugative effects, altering the electron density of the metal center and thereby facilitating the optimization of the Zn2+ insertion/extraction kinetics. The coordination environment of X&#8208;MIL&#8208;47 is analyzed using X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure spectroscopy, and the Zn2+ storage mechanism is thoroughly investigated through both in situ/ex situ spectroscopic techniques. The experimental results are consistent with DFT calculations, indicating that the introduction of polar substituents induces charge redistribution within the MOFs, thereby enhancing the reversibility of the redox reaction. Furthermore, a machine learning model based on the orthogonal expansion method and experimental data is developed to predict electrode material performance under varying conditions. This study provides new insights into the design of functional MOFs for energy storage applications.

         <title>Engineering CRISPR System&#8208;Based Bacterial Outer Membrane Vesicle Potentiates T Cell Immunity for Enhanced Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a multifunctional CRISPR&#8208;dCas9&#8208;based OMV platform termed OMV&#8208;C9I12, which facilitates the coexpression of CXCL9 and IL&#8208;12 within tumor cells. This platform enhances T cell recruitment and activation, synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 immunotherapy, and amplifies antitumor T cell immunity. This demonstrates significant therapeutic efficacy in a broad range of tumors and offers a promising strategy to overcome immunotherapy resistance.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has revolutionized cancer treatment but only benefits a subset of patients because of insufficient infiltration and inactivation of effector T cells. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) can activate immunity and deliver therapeutic agents for immunotherapy. However, efficiently targeting and packaging therapeutic molecules into OMVs remains challenging. Here, the engineered E. coli BL21&#8208;derived OMVs enable the packaging of multiple genes, resulting in a 7&#8208;fold increase in DNA enrichment efficiency and gene silencing in vitro. Moreover, the engineered OMVs carrying genes encoding CXCL9 and IL12 (OMV&#8208;C9I12) reprogram tumor cells to secrete these factors, significantly enhancing T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation. More importantly, this system markedly inhibits tumors, extends survival, and synergizes with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 therapy in murine MB49 and B16F10 tumor models. Single&#8208;cell RNA sequencing (scRNA&#8208;seq) further reveals significant upregulation of T&#8208;cell chemotaxis and activation&#8208;related pathways following OMV&#8208;C9I12 treatment. Finally, OMV&#8208;C9I12 potentiates T cell&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and suppresses the growth of bladder and breast cancer tumors in humanized mouse models. These findings highlight the potential of this engineered OMV platform for cancer gene therapy and provide novel strategies to overcome resistance to immunotherapy.

         <title>Hierarchically Structured Hollow Fiber Membranes for Efficient, Selective, and Scalable Mercury Ion Removal from Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hierarchically structured sulfurized polyacrylonitrile hollow fiber membranes are fabricated via wet spinning for efficient and selective mercury ion removal. The membranes demonstrate excellent adsorption performance and exceptional reusability, maintaining over 99% efficiency after multiple regeneration cycles. Integrated into a scalable purification device, they provide a robust and sustainable solution for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation in water systems.









Abstract
Mercury ions (Hg2+) pose serious threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health due to their high toxicity and bioaccumulation. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) nanoparticles, which contain soft Lewis base groups interact strongly with the soft Lewis acid Hg2+, demonstrating excellent adsorption performance and chemical stability. However, traditional methods typically involve dispersing SPAN nanoparticles in water or coating them on substrates, leading to uneven distribution, poor material stability, and potential secondary pollution. To overcome challenges in mercury removal, this study presents a highly selective, regenerable, and structurally stable SPAN&#8208;integrated hollow fiber membrane fabricated by wet spinning. The hierarchical structure significantly improves pore architecture, adsorption capacity, and long&#8208;term stability. The membrane achieves an initial Hg2+ removal efficiency of 98.31% and retains &#8776;99.7% efficiency after five regeneration cycles. When integrated into a scalable purification device, it removes 90.94% of Hg2+ from water with an initial Hg2+ concentration of 4.69 mg L&#8722;1. This work offers a novel, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective approach for large&#8208;scale mercury remediation.

         <title>Polymerization&#8208;Induced Crystallization to Form Stretchable Hydrogels with Banded Spherulites and Circularly Polarized Luminescence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites are developed by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites are obtained in soft gels. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance, affording the gels with circularly polarized luminescence.








Abstract
Reported here is the synthesis of stretchable hydrogels with large spherulites of different morphologies by polymerization&#8208;induced crystallization of dopant molecules. By varying the concentrations of chemical crosslinker and initiator, or the light intensity for photopolymerization, the stiffness of polyacrylamide network is tunable to regulate the crystallization of dibenzo&#8208;24&#8208;crown&#8208;8&#8208;ether molecules that form spherulites in the hydrogels. Regular spherulites are formed in relatively stiff gels, whereas banded spherulites with twisted crystal fibers are obtained in soft gels. The structure of spherulites is investigated by microscopy and scattering measurements. The formation of twisted crystal fibers is related to dynamic variations of crystallization pressure and network impedance. The gels with regular spherulites show stronger fluorescence and phosphorescence than those with banded spherulites. A remarkable fact is that the latter gels exhibit circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with dissymmetry factor up to +1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;2. This luminescence arises from the clusterization&#8208;triggered emission of the network constrained by the crystals, while the twisted fibers render the achiral clusterluminogens with CPL. The mutual influences between polymer network and crystal growth account for the collective functions of the composite gels. The design principle and chiral transfer mechanism should open opportunities for developing other soft materials with tailored crystals and optical properties.

         <title>From Physical Cross&#8208;Linking to Tailored Phosphorylation: Unlocking High&#8208;Performance and Biocompatible Xanthan&#8208;Konjac Hydrogels for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte, is crafted from xanthan gum and konjac gum through physical crosslinking and targeted phosphorylation. This design balances mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, enabling Zn//MnO&#8322; batteries with long cycle life and high Coulombic efficiency. Its biocompatibility and biodegradability offer a sustainable solution for flexible, wearable energy storage electronics.








Abstract
Natural polymer&#8208;based hydrogel electrolytes, though biocompatible and cost&#8208;effective, often exhibit poor mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, limiting their use in high&#8208;performance energy storage. Phos&#8208;XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte derived from xanthan gum (XG) and konjac glucomannan (KGM), has been developed via physical cross&#8208;linking and targeted phosphorylation. Specifically, physical cross&#8208;linking forms a robust 3D network that provides a stable structural foundation. Building on this, the phosphorylation process introduces phosphate monoesters (MPE) and diesters (DPE) in a precisely controlled ratio.

&lt;p&gt;Phos-XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte, is crafted from xanthan gum and konjac gum through physical crosslinking and targeted phosphorylation. This design balances mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, enabling Zn//MnO&#8322; batteries with long cycle life and high Coulombic efficiency. Its biocompatibility and biodegradability offer a sustainable solution for flexible, wearable energy storage electronics.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Natural polymer-based hydrogel electrolytes, though biocompatible and cost-effective, often exhibit poor mechanical strength and ionic conductivity, limiting their use in high-performance energy storage. Phos-XK, a novel hydrogel electrolyte derived from xanthan gum (XG) and konjac glucomannan (KGM), has been developed via physical cross-linking and targeted phosphorylation. Specifically, physical cross-linking forms a robust 3D network that provides a stable structural foundation. Building on this, the phosphorylation process introduces phosphate monoesters (MPE) and diesters (DPE) in a precisely controlled ratio. MPE groups enhance ionic conductivity by facilitating Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; desolvation and ion migration, while DPE strengthens mechanical integrity through enhanced cross-linking. These distinct roles of MPE and DPE are confirmed through both theoretical calculations and experimental results. Optimizing the phosphorylation ratio achieves a balance between mechanical strength (2.524&#160;MPa) and ionic conductivity (20.72 mS cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), resulting in remarkable electrochemical performance, including an extended cycle life exceeding 3000 h and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.45% in Zn//Cu batteries. Moreover, Phos-XK is biocompatible and biodegradable, ideal for sustainable energy storage. This work highlights the potential of bio-based materials to overcome the limitations of traditional hydrogel electrolytes and stresses the importance of molecular engineering in achieving high-performance, eco-friendly energy storage.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>A PROTAC&#8208;Based Cuproptosis Sensitizer in Lung Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS is developed in this work, which sensitizes cells to cuprotosis by modulating the p53 pathway through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome systemcan. CuS&#8208;MD@CS not only can effectively deplete endogenous glutathione but also can promote the transition from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, thereby enhancing cancer cells' sensitivity to cuproptosis and achieving effective therapeutic effects of cuprotosis and apoptosis.








Abstract
As an autonomous form of regulated cell death, cuproptosis depends on copper (Cu) and mitochondrial metabolism. However, the principle metabolic pathway known as glycolysis (Warburg effect) and high glutathione (GSH) levels of tumor cells inevitably lead to suboptimal efficacy in cuproptosis. Hence, depleting the endogenous GSH within tumors and shifting from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration are crucial factors for augmenting cuproptosis. In this study, a proteolysis targeting chimera (PROTAC)&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer (CuS&#8208;MD@CS) is innovatively constructed, which not only can induce cuproptosis and reactive oxygen species production via copper ions but also can regulate the expression of p53 protein via PROTACs through the ubiquitin&#8208;proteasome system in tumor cells, thus achieving endogenous GSH depletion and a shift from glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration, making cancer cells more sensitive to cuproptosis. Importantly, in vitro and in vivo experiments have verified that CuS&#8208;MD@CS effectively targets A549 cells and suppresses tumor growth through cuproptosis and apoptosis, exhibiting promising therapeutic responses. The novel PROTAC&#8208;based cuproptosis sensitizer CuS&#8208;MD@CS provides a new strategy for sensitizing cuproptosis and offers new hope for effective lung cancer treatment.

         <title>Bimetallic Nanocluster&#8208;Based Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes With High External Quantum Efficiency and Saturated Red Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, the fabrication of light&#8208;emitting diodes (LED) using self&#8208;emissive bimetallic gold&#8208;copper nanoclusters (NCs) is reported. The NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and the highest external quantum efficiency (EQE; 12.60%) value with pure red emission among the solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;based LEDs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;emissive atomically precise metal nanoclusters (NCs) are emerging as promising emissive layer material for next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs), thanks to their solid&#8208;state luminescence, well&#8208;defined structures, photo/thermal stability, low toxicity, and unique excited&#8208;state properties. However, achieving high external quantum efficiency (EQE) in solid&#8208;state NCs remains a formidable challenge. In this study, a highly stable bimetallic gold&#8208;copper NC forming [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] stabilized with 1&#8208;adamantanethiol (HSadm) and 1,2&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (DPPE) as the primary and secondary ligands, respectively is reported. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction and spectroscopic analyses suggest that the as&#8208;synthesized NC contains one phosphine bound to gold and the second phosphine has oxidized to phosphine oxide (P&#9552;O). The presence of such P&#9552;O moieties in the NC facilitated C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O interactions along with C&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;&#960; and H&#183;&#183;&#183;H interactions between ligands, promoting rapid crystallization. Due to the exceptional photo/thermal stability and enhanced solid&#8208;state photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY), [Au2Cu6(Sadm)6(DPPEO)2] NC is utilized to fabricate the NC&#8208;based LED (NC&#8208;LED) via the solution&#8208;processed technique, without using any additional host materials. The fabricated NC&#8208;LED shows a maximum brightness of 1246 cd&#160;m&#8722;2 and an EQE of 12.60% with a pure red emission &#8776;668 nm. This EQE value coupled with saturated pure red emission is the best among solution&#8208;processed and non&#8208;doped NC&#8208;LEDs, suggesting the enormous potential of the NCs for electro&#8208;optical devices.

         <title>Natural Design of a Stabilized Cross&#8208;&#946; Fold: Structure of the FuA FapC from Pseudomonas Sp. UK4 Reveals a Critical Role for Stacking of Imperfect Repeats</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We report a 3.2 &#197; cryoEM structure of functional amyloid protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4, an essential component of bacterial biofilm, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament, supports bioinformatically determined motifs, nuances AlphaFold predictions, emphasizes heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding and shows strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. FapC fibrils are intrinsically catalytic. This provides a structural foundation to design novel biomaterials.








Abstract
An essential structural component of bacterial biofilms is functional amyloid (FuA), which also has great potential as an engineerable nano&#8208;biomaterial. However, experimentally based high resolution structures of FuA that resolve individual residues are lacking. A fully experimentally based 3.2 &#197; resolution cryo&#8208;electron microscopy density map of the FuA protein FapC from Pseudomonas sp. UK4 is presented, which reveals a Greek key&#8208;shaped protofilament. The structure supports bioinformatic identification of conserved motifs and is broadly consistent with the AlphaFold prediction but with important modifications. Each FapC monomer consists of three imperfect repeats (IRs), with each repeat forming one cross&#8208;&#946; layer. An array of highly conserved Asn and Gln residues with an extensive H&#8208;bonding network underpins this conserved Greek key&#8208;shape and reveals the role of heterogeneous cross&#8208;&#946; stacking in amyloid cross&#8208;seeding. The covariation of residues in the hydrophobic core among different IRs suggests a cooperative monomer folding process during fibril elongation, while heterogeneous stacking of IRs reduces charge repulsion between layers to stabilize the monomer fold. The FapC fibrils show intrinsic catalytic activity and strain&#8208;dependent nanomechanical properties. Combined with mutagenesis data, the structure provides mechanistic insights into formation of FapC FuA from disordered monomers and a structural foundation for the design of novel biomaterials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;Mode Mechanochromic Responses from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomer Tubes of Uniform Sheath</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The structural&#8208;colored tube is created from cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers, exhibiting uniform color changes with high strain sensitivity upon extension and inflation. The color change occurs across multiple mechanochromic modes, highlighting the influence of molecular anisotropy and tubular geometry on strain sensitivity. The tubes demonstrate reconfigurable alphabet displays and 3D photonic skins.









Abstract
Materials that exhibit varied optical responses to different modes of mechanical stimuli are attractive for complex sensing and adaptive functionalities. However, most mechanochromic materials are fabricated from films or fibers with limited actuation modes. Here, hollow tubes of a symmetric sheath are created using cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) at the sub&#8208;millimeter scale. The oligomeric precursor is sheared in an elastomeric microchannel to form uniform thickness, overcoming gravity effect and Plateau&#8208;Rayleigh instability. In addition, the coloration is achieved to be faster and have higher reflectivity compared to that of solid fibers. The tube can undergo axial, circumferential, and radial strains upon extension and inflation. The combination of molecular anisotropy and geometry of the tube enables highly sensitive mechanochromic responses in both azimuthal and axial directions: inflation causes red&#8208;to&#8208;violet shift (&#8776;220&#160;nm) at a circumferential strain of 0.57. The inflation of a bent tube generates another mechanochromic mode with a higher sensitivity to strain. Finally, display of 26 alphabets is achieved using 5 tubes, of which the positions can be reconfigured, and curvature&#8208;dependent 3D photonic skins are demonstrated from tubes wrapped around 3D objects. The multi&#8208;mode mechanochromic tubes will find applications for soft robotics, adaptive displays, wearable sensors, and spectrometers.

     alt="Multi-Mode Mechanochromic Responses from Cholesteric Liquid Crystal Elastomer Tubes of Uniform Sheath"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The structural-colored tube is created from cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers, exhibiting uniform color changes with high strain sensitivity upon extension and inflation. The color change occurs across multiple mechanochromic modes, highlighting the influence of molecular anisotropy and tubular geometry on strain sensitivity. The tubes demonstrate reconfigurable alphabet displays and 3D photonic skins.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Materials that exhibit varied optical responses to different modes of mechanical stimuli are attractive for complex sensing and adaptive functionalities. However, most mechanochromic materials are fabricated from films or fibers with limited actuation modes. Here, hollow tubes of a symmetric sheath are created using cholesteric liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs) at the sub-millimeter scale. The oligomeric precursor is sheared in an elastomeric microchannel to form uniform thickness, overcoming gravity effect and Plateau-Rayleigh instability. In addition, the coloration is achieved to be faster and have higher reflectivity compared to that of solid fibers. The tube can undergo axial, circumferential, and radial strains upon extension and inflation. The combination of molecular anisotropy and geometry of the tube enables highly sensitive mechanochromic responses in both azimuthal and axial directions: inflation causes red-to-violet shift (&#8776;220&#160;nm) at a circumferential strain of 0.57. The inflation of a bent tube generates another mechanochromic mode with a higher sensitivity to strain. Finally, display of 26 alphabets is achieved using 5 tubes, of which the positions can be reconfigured, and curvature-dependent 3D photonic skins are demonstrated from tubes wrapped around 3D objects. The multi-mode mechanochromic tubes will find applications for soft robotics, adaptive displays, wearable sensors, and spectrometers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Exclusive Encapsulation Adhesive in a Neutral&#8208;Plane Model for Ultrahigh Mechanical Stability of Flexible Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The detachment behavior between the adhesives and the electrodes are always caused by significant interlayer shear stress during bending in neutral plane flexible perovskite solar cells (NP&#8208;FPSCs). A crosslinkable polymer named acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is introduced to form a stable network, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability &#8212; the most mechanically stable devices reported to date.









Abstract
The functional layers of flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) are subjected to significant stress during bending, causing structural failure and declining power conversion efficiency. To alleviate stress, a neutral plane (NP) is introduced by positioning the functional layers at the center of the device, with top metal electrode encapsulated by a protective layer. However, adhesive detachment remains a critical issue during multiple bending cycles, and the underlying mechanism remains unclear. In this study, a systematic analysis of the detachment behavior in NP&#8208;FPSC reveals that commercial adhesives with high Young's modulus and low adhesion strength struggle to withstand interlayer shear stress during bending, which triggers detachment between adhesives and electrodes. To address this issue, a crosslinkable polymer acrylated isoprene rubber (AIR) is designed with long linear polyisoprene main chain and acrylate side chains, providing high flexibility and reduced chain segment movement. AIR can be crosslinked under UV irradiation to form a stable network with ultralow Young's modulus and high adhesion strength, ensuring a strong bond between the protective layer and FPSCs, constructing stable NP&#8208;FPSCs. The resultant NP&#8208;FPSCs demonstrate excellent mechanical stability, retaining 92.8% of their initial efficiency after 50&#8201;000 bending cycles at a radius of 4 mm, meeting the IEC 62715&#8208;6&#8208;3 standards.

         <title>Deep Reconstruction of RuPdOx Hollow Nanofibers for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrazine Oxidation&#8208;Assisted Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid and deep reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers to generate RuO2/Pd heterostructure is achieved to regulate the local electronic environment of catalyst during hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) processes. Thus the obtained material exhibits exceptional ampere&#8208;grade&#8208;current&#8208;density HER and HzOR properties, enabling significnat energy&#8208;saving H2 production performance.








Abstract
Manipulating the reconstruction of a heterostructured material is highly desirable to achieve high&#8208;performance electrocatalytic performance. Here, an in situ reconstruction of RuPdOx hollow nanofibers (HNFs) is presented to generate RuO2/Pd from both the electrochemical and chemical reconstruction processes. The reconstructed catalyst is highly efficient for both hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at industrial&#8208;grade current densities, significantly outperforming the benchmark Pt/C catalyst. Furthermore, it maintains a record&#8208;breaking durability of 500 h for HzOR at 1 A cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, with the catalyst as electrodes, a two&#8208;electrode overall hydrazine splitting (OHzS) cell is constructed, which requires only 0.263 kWh of electricity to produce 1 m3 H2 at 100 mA cm&#8722;2, significantly lower than that in overall water splitting (OWS) system (4.286 kWh m&#8722;3 H2), exhibiting an exceptional energy&#8208;saving H2 production property. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal an efficient electron transfer from Pd to RuO2 at their interface from the reconstruction of RuPdOx HNFs, which regulates the local electronic environment of atoms, modulates the adsorption and desorption for intermediates, and reduces the energy barriers for enhancing the electrocatalytic process. This study offers a robust reconstruction strategy for the design of electrocatalysts that exhibit superior efficiency in energy conversion devices.

         <title>Origami Crawlers: Exploring A Single Origami Vertex for Complex Path Navigation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates that the nonlinear kinematics of origami sheets can be exploited to realize crawlers capable of multimodal locomotion under a single actuation input. In particular, it focuses on one of the simplest origami building blocks &#8208; a rigid degree&#8208;four vertex &#8208; and identifies designs that enable movement in a straight line as well as turning left or right by simply controlling the folding range of the actuated fold.








Abstract
The ancient art of origami, traditionally used to transform simple sheets into intricate objects, also holds potential for diverse engineering applications, such as shape morphing and robotics. In this study, it is demonstrated that one of the most basic origami structures&#8211;a rigid, foldable degree&#8208;four vertex&#8211;can be engineered to create a crawler capable of navigating complex paths using only a single input. Through a combination of experimental studies and modeling, it is shown that modifying the geometry of a degree&#8208;four vertex enables sheets to move either in a straight line or turn. Furthermore, it is illustrated that leveraging the nonlinearities in folding allows the design of crawlers that can switch between moving straight and turning. Remarkably, these crawling modes can be controlled by adjusting the range of the folding angle's actuation. This study opens avenues for simple machines that can follow intricate trajectories with minimal&#160;actuation.

         <title>Designing the Self&#8208;Assembly of Disordered Materials Via Color Frustration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
What if disorder can be designed? This work introduces a strategy to self&#8208;assemble amorphous materials by designing bonding rules for patchy particles that suppress crystallinity and promote frustration. The designer particles nucleate a network of dodecahedral cages from the liquid, yielding a novel equilibrium amorphous phase. This approach redefines how disorder and function can be programmed at the colloidal scale.








Abstract
The ability to control self&#8208;assembly with atomic&#8208;level precision has led to remarkable advances in the rational design of crystalline materials. However, similar design strategies have yet to be developed for amorphous materials. Here, a strategy is devised for programming the self&#8208;assembly of amorphous structures by encoding frustration into the building block design. The building blocks are tailored to locally favor the formation of five&#8208;member rings and yield a network of face&#8208;sharing dodecahedral cages whose icosahedral symmetry prevents long&#8208;range order. Surprisingly, unlike geometrically frustrated glasses that form through kinetic arrest, the network nucleates spontaneously from the liquid phase, representing a novel type of thermodynamically stable disordered phase. The stabilization of this frustrated phase via programmable interactions paves the way for a new generation of disordered&#160;materials.

         <title>Morphotropic Phase Boundary in Irradiated Ferroelectric Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Irradiation rather than composition is used to induce helix/trans morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectric polymers. Markedly enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is achieved in ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;trifluoroethylene) copolymers. This postprocessing approach is generally applicable to different ferroelectric polymer compositions and sources of irradiation, offering a scalable tool to design of ferroelectric polymers with high piezoelectric properties.








Abstract
Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) enables a large piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric polymers. However, till now MPB has only been observed in a few polymers, which is induced by compositional tuning of the polymer composition. Here a distinct approach to design MPB in ferroelectric polymers is reported via ion irradiation. Without changing composition as required by the conventional compositional approach, the formation of helix/trans MPB in ferroelectric polymers is achieved upon increasing the irradiation dose, near which a substantially enhanced piezoelectric coefficient d33 of &#8208;69.8 pC N&#8722;1 is observed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by using different sources of irradiation and polymer compositions, which offers a general and scalable postprocessing tool to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric polymers.

&lt;p&gt;Irradiation rather than composition is used to induce helix/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) in ferroelectric polymers. Markedly enhanced piezoelectric coefficient &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; of -69.8 pC N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved in ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-&lt;i&gt;co&lt;/i&gt;-trifluoroethylene) copolymers. This postprocessing approach is generally applicable to different ferroelectric polymer compositions and sources of irradiation, offering a scalable tool to design of ferroelectric polymers with high piezoelectric properties.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) enables a large piezoelectric effect in ferroelectric polymers. However, till now MPB has only been observed in a few polymers, which is induced by compositional tuning of the polymer composition. Here a distinct approach to design MPB in ferroelectric polymers is reported via ion irradiation. Without changing composition as required by the conventional compositional approach, the formation of helix/&lt;i&gt;trans&lt;/i&gt; MPB in ferroelectric polymers is achieved upon increasing the irradiation dose, near which a substantially enhanced piezoelectric coefficient &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; of -69.8 pC N&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; is observed. The effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by using different sources of irradiation and polymer compositions, which offers a general and scalable postprocessing tool to effectively improve the piezoelectric response of ferroelectric polymers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Kinetics and Stability of Zn&#8208;MnO2 Batteries with a Multifunctional TiO2 Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TiO2&#8208;coated MnO2 cathodes enhance the cycling stability and capacity of zinc&#8208;ion batteries by improving kinetics and inhibiting Mn dissolution. The multifunctional TiO2 coating forms a coherent interface with MnO2, creating an electron&#8208;enriched surface that promotes rapid electron/ion transport and proton&#8208;dominated reactions. Additionally, the coating mitigates Mn dissolution and buffers volume changes, offering a promising solution for advanced energy storage.









Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries are a promising energy storage alternative, offering safety, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environment&#8208;friendliness. MnO2 is appealing for its high capacity and output voltage, but it suffers from slow kinetics and poor stability due to severe Mn dissolution during cycling. Here, the performance of MnO2 is enhanced by coating it with a uniform TiO2 nanolayer that incorporates oxygen vacancies. The TiO2&#8208;MnO2 heterogeneous interface results in the formation of Ti&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bonds and a reduction in the interfacial valence state, thereby leading to the creation of an interface electron&#8208;enriched region that facilitates faster electron and ion transport. This multifunctional TiO2 coating not only promotes proton&#8208;dominated electrochemical reactions and ion diffusion but also acts as a protective barrier, preventing Mn dissolution and buffering volume changes during cycling. Consequently, the MnO2@TiO2 cathode demonstrates excellent specific capacity (299 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1) and cycling stability, achieving 91.4% capacity retention after 2500 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1 and 92.7% capacity retention after 600 cycles at a low current density of 0.2 A g&#8722;1. These results outperform many previously reported manganese&#8208;based cathodes, demonstrating MnO2@TiO2&#8217;s potential as a high&#8208;performance and durable cathode material for zinc&#8208;ion batteries and advancing the development of efficient energy storage solutions.

         <title>Efficient Cu&#9472;Co Dual&#8208;Sites in Cobalt Oxide Nanoboxes for Electrocatalytic Reduction of Low&#8208;Concentration NO to NH3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical reduction of low&#8208;concentration NO presents a promising avenue for NH3 production, offering a sustainable solution to environmental challenges. Cu&#9472;Co dual&#8208;sites in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are developed for NO electroreduction, boasting a Faraday efficiency of 94.13% and an NH3 yield of 54.28 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1. A Zn&#8208;NO battery has also been successfully demonstrated for simultaneous NO elimination, NH3 generation, and power output.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic conversion of nitric oxide (NO) to ammonia (NH3) epitomizes an advanced approach in NH3 synthesis, crucial for efficiently converting low&#8208;concentration industrial NO exhaust and contributing significantly to environmental preservation. Catalyst design remains one pivotal element in addressing this challenge. Here, efficient Cu&#9472;Co dual active sites embedded in hollow cobalt oxide nanoboxes are created for the electrocatalytic low&#8208;concentration NO reduction reaction (NORR). Cu&#8208;modified cobalt oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4) and its heterophase interface with copper oxide (Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO) both exhibit over 93% Faraday efficiency for NH3 synthesis, with a yield reaching up to 59.10 &#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.4 V versus reversible hydrogen electrode by utilizing simulated industrial NO exhaust (1 vol %) as the feedstock, surpassing those of pure cobalt oxide and some reported catalysts. Theoretical calculations and NO temperature&#8208;programmed desorption experiments demonstrate that the incorporation of Cu significantly enhances NO adsorption and reduces the energy barrier of the rate&#8208;determining step. The integration of Cu&#8208;Co3O4 and Cu&#8208;Co3O4/CuO within the cathode of the Zn&#8211;NO battery demonstrates a notable power density of 2.02 mW cm&#8722;2, highlighting a propitious direction for investigating highly efficient conversion of low&#8208;concentration NO exhaust gas.

         <title>Effect of Combination Model of MoTe2 and MXene Layers on Sodium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, in which the (002) crystal plane of MoTe2 is perpendicular to the MXene layer, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) crystal plane parallel to MXene layer has a more stable interface structure and more sodium ion storage sites, thereby achieving excellent electrochemical performance.








Abstract
The integration of different crystal planes between two&#8208;dimensional (2D) materials results in various combinations, which always exert different effects on the electrochemical properties of materials. The metallic 1T&#8242; phase of molybdenum telluride is a promising anode for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs), but its rearrangement and restacking during charge/discharge process causes a decline in cycle. Herein, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P with MoTe2 (002) planes parallel to MXene layers and MX@MoTe2&#8208;V with MoTe2 (002) planes perpendicular to MXene layers are controllably constructed. Compared with MX@MoTe2&#8208;V, the new interface formed between MoTe2 and MXene in MX@MoTe2&#8208;P has a stronger van der Waals interaction and larger contact area, helpful to store more sodium ions and contributing to its excellent structural stability and battery capacity. Although MX@MoTe2&#8208;V has a higher sodium adsorption energy than MX@MoTe2&#8208;P, the small interface area lowers the storage capacity and it further aggravates the collapse of the structure. When used as the anode for SIBs, MX@MoTe2&#8208;P offers excellent cycle stability and specific capacity. In particular, sodium&#8208;ion full cell consisting of MX@MoTe2&#8208;P anode and Na3V2(PO4)3 cathode shows the excellent performance (147.2 mAh g&#8722;1@1000 cycles at 5 A g&#8722;1) surpassing all the reported MoTe2&#8208;based materials. This work provides a guide for the manufacture of new electrode materials.

         <title>Nanozyme&#8208;Reinforced Hydrogel Spray as a Reactive Oxygen Species&#8208;Driven Oxygenator to Accelerate Diabetic Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The authors fabricate a reactive oxygen species&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray, which can rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the OxyGel spray accelerates full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats.









Abstract
The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and poor oxygen supply are two prominent factors of the inflammatory microenvironment that delay diabetic wound healing. However, current clinical treatments cannot achieve effective ROS scavenging and sustained oxygenation. Herein, a ROS&#8208;driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray that integrates a multifunctional nanozyme with a dynamically crosslinked sprayable hydrogel matrix is presented. The nanozyme, which is fabricated based on the ceria&#8208;zoledronic acid nanoparticles modified with tannic acid (TCZ nanozymes), can mimic the cascade catalytic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to effectively scavenge ROS while generating oxygen. These synergistic actions rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1&#8208;to&#8208;M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the nanozyme via the hydrogel spray stably deposits the nanozymes at the target sites to accelerate full&#8208;thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats. Furthermore, RNA&#8208;seq results revealed the upregulation of multiple signaling pathways related to wound healing by the OxyGel spray, highlighting the potential of this platform not only for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds but also other diseases associated with oxidative stress and hypoxia.

A single administration of the OxyGel spray accelerates full-thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and poor oxygen supply are two prominent factors of the inflammatory microenvironment that delay diabetic wound healing. However, current clinical treatments cannot achieve effective ROS scavenging and sustained oxygenation. Herein, a ROS-driven oxygenation hydrogel (OxyGel) spray that integrates a multifunctional nanozyme with a dynamically crosslinked sprayable hydrogel matrix is presented. The nanozyme, which is fabricated based on the ceria-zoledronic acid nanoparticles modified with tannic acid (TCZ nanozymes), can mimic the cascade catalytic activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) to effectively scavenge ROS while generating oxygen. These synergistic actions rebalance the oxidative and hypoxic microenvironment of the diabetic wound, promote M1-to-M2 macrophage repolarization, and enhance the survival, migration, and angiogenesis of endothelial cells. A single administration of the nanozyme via the hydrogel spray stably deposits the nanozymes at the target sites to accelerate full-thickness back skin wound and refractory foot ulcer wound healing in diabetic rats. Furthermore, RNA-seq results revealed the upregulation of multiple signaling pathways related to wound healing by the OxyGel spray, highlighting the potential of this platform not only for the treatment of refractory diabetic wounds but also other diseases associated with oxidative stress and hypoxia.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Crystalline&#8208;Dependent Magnon Torques in All&#8208;Sputtered Hf/Cr2O3/Ferromagnet Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Magnon torques can overcome the Joule heating issue in traditional spintronic devices. The crystalline dependence of magnon torques in Hf/Cr2O3/FM heterostructures is demonstrated. Magnon torques are generated when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 is parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf. Furthermore, the magnetization switching of perpendicularly magnetized CoFeB is achieved using magnon torques.








Abstract
Electron motion in spin&#8208;orbit torque devices inevitably leads to the Joule heating issue. Magnon torques can potentially circumvent this issue, as it enables the transport of spin angular momentum in insulating magnetic materials. In this work, a sandwich structure composed of Hf/antiferromagnetic Cr2O3/ferromagnet is fabricated and demonstrates that the magnon torque is strongly dependent on the crystalline structure of Cr2O3. Magnon torques are stronger when the N&#233;el vector of Cr2O3 aligns parallel to the spin polarization generated in Hf, while they are suppressed when the N&#233;el vector is perpendicular to the spin polarization. The magnon torque efficiency is estimated to be &#8722;0.134 using in&#8208;plane second harmonic Hall measurements. Using magnon torques, perpendicular magnetization switching of CoFeB is achieved, with a critical switching current density of 4.09 &#215; 107 A&#160;cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the spin angular momentum loss due to the insertion of Cr2O3 is found to be lower than that of polycrystalline NiO. The work highlights the role of antiferromagnet crystalline structures in controlling magnon torques, broadening the potential applications of magnon torques.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Splitting Magnetoresistance in Altermagnetic RuO2 Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel magnetoresistance effect termed spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) is demonstrated in (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers. The SSMR is underpinned by the spin&#8211;charge interconversion process induced by the nonrelativistic spin&#8208;splitting effect in altermagnets. Utilizing the SSMR, a [001]&#8208;oriented N&#233;el vector in an epitaxial thin film of RuO2 is revealed, which evidences its altermagnetism.








Abstract
The recently discovered altermagnets, featured by the exotic correlation of magnetic exchange interaction and alternating crystal environments, have offered exciting cutting&#8208;edge opportunities for spintronics. Nevertheless, the altermagnetism of RuO2, one of the earliest&#8208;discovered altermagnets, is currently under intense debate. Here, this controversy is attempted to be resolved by demonstrating a spin&#8208;splitting magnetoresistance (SSMR) effect that is driven by a spin current associated with the giant nonrelativistic spin splitting of an altermagnet. Compared to the spin Hall magnetoresistance induced by a conventional relativistic spin current, the SSMR is characterized by unusual angular dependence with a phase&#8208;shift feature underpinned by the N&#233;el&#8208;vector orientation and pronounced temperature dependence caused by its susceptibility to electron scattering. Through systematical investigations on the magnetoresistance of (101)&#8208;RuO2/Co bilayers, a sizable SSMR is disentangled and hence a N&#233;el vector along [001] direction is unveiled. This work not only demonstrates a simple electric avenue for probing the N&#233;el vector of altermagnets, but also indicates long&#8208;range magnetic order in thin films of RuO2.

         <title>Native Defect Elimination and Lattice Framework Reinforcement Toward Ultra&#8208;Stable Sodium&#8208;Ion Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conventional solid&#8208;phase sintered samples have native surface defects, mainly consisting of lattice mismatches and elemental distortions, and pose problems of TM dissolution and crack growth during subsequent cycles. With an understanding of the spatial distribution of the defects and an appreciation of the importance of the surface state, a strategy of surface defect elimination and crystal framework enhancement is applied and demonstrated to provide strong stability of the cathodes treated by this strategy.








Abstract
Structural and performance degradation in layered transition metal oxide (TMO) cathode materials is often attributed to phase transition induction during sodium de&#8208;embedding, while the significance of native defects during complex synthesis is frequently overlooked. Here, the role of native surface remodeling in progressive capacity degradation in P2&#8208;type Na2/3Ni1/3Mn2/3O2 is emphasized, where lattice mismatches and elemental distortions are found on the surface of the particles and result in the accumulation of low&#8208;valent TMs. Interestingly, the accumulation gradually became the center of cathodic degradation rather than phase transition induction. Given the apparent spatiality of the primary defects and recognizing the importance of the surface state, the stripping repair of the defects and gradient introduction of La can be manipulated. The unique LaO6 configuration enhanced the rigid framework of TMO6 and suppressed the emergence of low&#8208;valent TMs, resulting in surface&#8208;corrected and reinforced particles, which can be explained by generalized functional density calculations and ex&#8208;situ hard X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy. As a result, the reinforced cathode brought about a capacity retention of up to 98% for 500 cycles at 2 C and 87% for 4000 cycles at 10 C and stable electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range (&#8722;20&#160;&#176;C&#8211;60&#160;&#176;C).

         <title>Highly Robust and Conductive Polymer Electrodes for Droplet Energy Harvesting and Printable On&#8208;Skin Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is developed by using PBFDO as the electrical phase and TPU as the mechanical phase, featuring exceptional properties including high conductivity, mechanical toughness, robustness, stretchability, stability, recyclability, and biocompatibility. Leveraging the capabilities of the BC&#8208;PE, a record high&#8208;performance droplet electricity generator and a self&#8208;powered electronic skin for the human&#8208;machine interface are achieved.








Abstract
Solution&#8208;processable conductive polymers have exhibited promising electrical properties. However, their brittleness and unsatisfactory mechanical characteristics have hindered their creation of flexible electrodes. Here, a robust bi&#8208;continuous polymer electrode (BC&#8208;PE) is reported that features a stable and high electrical conductivity (&gt;60&#8201;S&#8201;cm&#8722;1), remarkable stretchability (&gt;600%), high fracture strength (&gt;57 MPa), excellent toughness (&gt;230&#160;MJ&#8201;m&#8722;3), recyclability, and biocompatibility. The BC&#8208;PE is fabricated by facilely blending a high&#8208;conducting polymer poly(benzodifurandione)(PBFDO) with thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). Serving as a flexible electrode for a droplet electricity generator, a record high current density of 29.2 A m&#8722;2 and a power density of 1124.2 W m&#8722;2 have been attained. Moreover, the versatility of the BC&#8208;PE is validated by the direct ink writing technique, and a soft, thin, BC&#8208;PE&#8208;based self&#8208;powered electronic skin is demonstrated for touch&#8208;track recognition. This work presents a straightforward strategy for the development of advanced conductive polymer electrodes that well address the tradeoffs between conductivity and mechanical properties, showcasing their promising applications in energy harvesting and on&#8208;skin human&#8208;machine interfaces.

         <title>Designing an Anionic Layer in Low&#8208;Concentration Electrolytes to Promote In&#8208;Plane Ion Diffusion for Dendrite&#8208;Free Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An optimization model for zinc anodes centered on anion traction in a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte system is proposed. The fluoride&#8208;ion enriched interfacial layer on the zinc anode surface enhances the concentration of Zn2+ in a lateral direction through electrostatic forces, thereby facilitating horizontal zinc plating. Moreover, the repulsion between the anion&#8208;rich layer and sulfate ions can effectively inhibit the formation of byproducts.








Abstract
In contrast to high&#8208;concentration electrolyte systems, low&#8208;concentration electrolytes provide a cost&#8208;effective strategy to advance the commercialization of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). However, such electrolytes frequently exhibit severe dendrite formation caused by localized Zn2+ concentration gradients, which critically compromise the cycling stability and operational safety of AZIBs. In this work, an innovative approach is proposed that involves the in situ construction of a fluoride&#8208;ion (F&#8722;) enriched interfacial layer on zinc anodes. This method facilitates in&#8208;plane diffusion of zinc ions at the anode interface, resulting in accelerated lateral growth of zinc deposits rather than dendritic formation. The results indicate that this orientated growth is closely associated with an anionic layer that effectively reduces random and irregular deposition as well as undesirable side reactions. The proposed system exhibits exceptional electrochemical performance within a low&#8208;concentration electrolyte framework, achieving a battery lifespan exceeding 1500 h at a current density of 2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, it maintains Coulombic efficiency above 99% after 800 h of cycling. Additionally, the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O (NVO)//Zn full battery incorporating this additive showcases enhanced long&#8208;term cycling performance and improved capacity retention, further confirming the excellent reversibility of the plating/stripping processes for zinc anode.

         <title>Broadband Excitation from X&#8208;Ray to UV for Afterglow Emission in Monodisperse Lanthanide&#8208;Doped Nanoengineered Molecular Nanotransducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cyan and green long&#8208;afterglow luminescence in NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@SiO2 is achieved through a molecular doping strategy under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation, respectively. The rationally designed structure of NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4@4&#8208;PP&#8208;doped SiO2 NCs, facilitated by hydrogen bonding and physical interactions, stabilizes the triplet state of 4&#8208;PP, thereby enabling afterglow emission under UV and X&#8208;ray excitation. This approach expands the library of optical codes for information encryption.








Abstract
The rational design of uniform afterglow nanoparticles (NPs) is critical for applications such as bioimaging and information storage. However, excitation of afterglow NPs remains largely limited to either X&#8208;ray or UV light. Integrating both X&#8208;ray&#8208; and UV&#8208;responsive afterglow components into a single NP platform remains a major challenge. Here, a broadband excitation strategy (X&#8208;ray to UV) is reported for afterglow emission using lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoengineered molecular nanotransducers. A 4&#8208;phenylpyridine (4&#8208;PP)&#8208;doped SiO2 shell is grown on NaLuF4:Tb(15 mol%)@NaYF4 NPs. The SiO2 shell is first coated onto the core, then functionalized via hydrothermal reaction with 4&#8208;PP. Hydrogen bonding and physical interactions between 4&#8208;PP and the SiO2 matrix enable blue afterglow emission at 472&#160;nm with a 2.41 s lifetime under 290&#160;nm excitation. Under X&#8208;ray excitation, high&#8208;energy photons induce defect formation in the NaLuF4:Tb3+ core, where stored energy is transferred to Tb3+ ions, producing green afterglow with a persistence time exceeding 600 s. This dual&#8208;mode excitation expands the operational versatility of afterglow materials. This approach demonstrates a promising strategy for integrating multiple optically active components into a single core&#8211;shell NP structure, offering tunable and extended afterglow performance for advanced optoelectronic and imaging applications.

         <title>Monodisperse Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co Modules Enable Ampere&#8208;Level Hydrazine&#8208;Assisted Seawater Splitting in Membraneless Electrolyzers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monodispersed Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single&#8208;atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst (Os&#8208;Co(OH)2). By leveraging d&#8208;p orbital hybridization, the adsorption energy of active sites is optimally tuned, endowing the catalyst with exceptional intrinsic activity for both the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR).








Abstract
Hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted seawater electrolysis (HzOR&#8208;SWE) is critical for addressing freshwater scarcity and energy crises. However, the development of this technology has been significantly impeded by the absence of efficient catalysts capable of cleaving N&#9472;H bonds during the hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Herein, Monodispersed Os&#8208;O&#8208;Co modules are constructed within a cobalt hydroxide structure via an in situ osmium (Os) single&#8208;atom modification strategy to serve as a bifunctional catalyst. The d&#8208;p orbital hybridization in the structure shifts the d&#8208;band center of Os sites away from the Fermi level, weakening the adsorption energy of reaction intermediates and exhibiting the lowest N&#9472;H dehydrogenation energy barrier for HzOR and moderate active hydrogen adsorption energy for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). When integrated into a membraneless flow cell (MFC), the catalyst demonstrates exceptional performance in HzOR&#8208;SWE, requiring only 0.768 V to deliver 1.0 A cm&#8722;2 with a remarkable rate of 31.9 moles of hydrogen per kilowatt&#8208;hour (kWh). This represents a 70.7% energy saving compared to conventional seawater splitting systems (2.62 V, 7.6 kWh mol&#8722;1). This work holds significant importance for advancing the economic viability of low&#8208;energy seawater electrolysis for hydrogen production.

         <title>Oxygen&#8208;Evolving Covalent Organic Frameworks via Phosphonate Ylide&#8208;Engineering for Enhanced Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting. However, the high electron density at aromatic carbon in COFs generates inert oxygen evolution, significantly hindering photocatalytic activity. Developing phosphonate ylide&#8208;sites in COFs enables polaron&#8208;enhanced charge separation and low oxygen evolution barriers, achieving a 62&#8208;fold increase in H2/O2 production over pristine COFs and enabling scalable outdoor hydrogen generation.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) exhibit significant promise for photocatalytic overall water splitting to hydrogen generation. However, the high electron density distribution at aromatic carbon in COFs results in inert oxygen evolution, significantly hindering photocatalytic overall water splitting activity. Here, a universal strategy is developed for localized electron density manipulation by utilizing the reactivity of unsaturated carbon at the linkers in the COFs to construct phosphonate ylide polar sites, featuring positively charged phosphorus and negatively charged carbon. Under photoexcitation, this local electron distribution generates a polaron effect, enhances photogenerated exciton dissociation, prevents radiative relaxation, accelerates photogenerated charge separation, and induces an extremely low oxygen evolution barrier at the phosphorus sites. The results show the phosphonate ylide COF has achieved H2 and O2 evolution rates of 24.7 and 12.0&#160;&#181;mol&#160;h&#8722;1 under visible light irradiation, with the 62 times increase over the pristine COF. Furthermore, this strategy has been successfully validated in several other COFs, demonstrating its broad applicability. To further validate its practical utility, a large&#8208;scale outdoor device of 4&#160;m2 using this catalyst is fabricated, which achieved a hydrogen production rate exceeding 300&#160;mmol&#160;day&#8722;1, highlighting its excellent potential for practical applications.

Ferroelectric nitrides attract immense attention due to their excellent electrical, mechanical, and thermal properties as well as for their compatibility with scalable semiconductor technology. The availability of high&#8208;quality nitride films possessing tailorable coercive voltage and field, however, remains challenging, and is a key for deeper exploration of switching dynamics and practical applications in low&#8208;power devices. 2D growth of epitaxial thin (&#8818;20&#160;nm) c&#8208;axis&#8208;oriented Sc0.3Al0.7N films is reported on Al2O3 (0001) and on electrically conductive 4H&#8208;SiC (0001), obtained by reflection high&#8208;energy electron diffraction&#8208;monitored layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer physical vapor deposition growth. Films exhibit high quality, as evidenced by rocking curve full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) as narrow as &#8776;0.02&#176;, and an atomically abrupt film&#8208;substrate interface with low dislocation density. The coercive field of Sc0.3Al0.7N/4H&#8208;SiC (0001) heterostructures is as low as 2.75 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1. Moreover, a high endurance of &gt;109 cycles at saturation polarization is achieved. Density functional theory calculations of a model system reveal that an improved crystal quality, including atomically abrupt ferroelectric nitride&#8208;metal interface, facilitates the reduction in the switching barriers, and leads to reduced coercivity. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of obtaining high&#8208;quality epitaxial ferroelectric nitride films on highly scalable and radiation&#8208;resistant substrates, and their potential for energy&#8208;efficient electronic devices.

         <title>Potential&#8208;Controlled Pre&#8208;SEI Regulation for Improved Lithium Reversibility in Anode&#8208;Free Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A pre&#8208;solid electrolyte interphase (pre&#8208;SEI) is designed by a potentiostatic controlling electrolyte decomposition method to reduce Li loss for SEI formation and smooth Li deposition/dissolution behavior, prolonging the cycling life of anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
Anode&#8208;free solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries (AF&#8208;SSLMBs) with high safety and improved energy density receive increasing attention but are restricted by the low Coulombic efficiencies (CEs) that result from undesirable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) formation and irreversible Li deposition/dissolution. Herein, a pre&#8208;SEI is designed by a potentiostatic controlling electrolyte decomposition method to reduce Li loss for SEI formation and smooth Li deposition/dissolution behavior. When holding the potential at 0.5&#160;V, the electrolyte additive ethoxy&#8208;pentafluoro&#8208;cyclotriphosphazene (PFPN) and lithium salts simultaneously decompose to form a dense double&#8208;layered pre&#8208;SEI with high ionic conductivity, enabling fast Li+ transport across the interface and suppressing the following Li loss of building SEI. As a result, a high initial CE (ICE: 95.5%) and stable CE of 98.7% in Li|Cu cells are achieved, which is a 12.7% and 0.7% improvement compared with the&#160;counterpart without pre&#8208;SEI. Moreover, the cycling life of the assembled AF&#8208;SSLMB pouch cell (Cu||LFP) with pre&#8208;SEI is prolonged by 5 times, with a capacity retention rate of 44.9% after 100 cycles. This work provides a scalable strategy to reduce Li loss for both building SEI and following the Li plating/stripping process in AF&#8208;SSLMBs.

         <title>Machine&#8208;Learning&#8208;Aided Advanced Electrochemical Biosensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical biosensors are highly sensitive, portable, and versatile. Advanced nanomaterials enhance their performance, while machine learning (ML) improves data analysis, minimizes interference, and optimizes sensor design. Despite progress in both fields, their combined potential in diagnostics remains underexplored. This review highlights ML applications in electrochemical biosensors, showcasing their transformative impact on diagnostics and screening.








Abstract
Electrochemical biosensors offer numerous advantages, including high sensitivity, specificity, portability, ease of use, rapid response times, versatility, and multiplexing capability. Advanced materials and nanomaterials enhance electrochemical biosensors by improving sensitivity, response, and portability. Machine learning (ML) integration with electrochemical biosensors is also gaining traction, being particularly promising for addressing challenges such as electrode fouling, interference from non&#8208;target analytes, variability in testing conditions, and inconsistencies across samples. ML enhances data processing and analysis efficiency, generating actionable results with minimal information loss. Additionally, ML is well&#8208;suited for handling large, noisy datasets often generated in continuous monitoring applications. Beyond data analysis, ML can also help optimize biosensor design and function. While extensive research has expanded applications of advanced and nanomaterials&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors and ML in their respective fields, fewer studies explore their combined potential in diagnostics; their synergy holds immense promise for advancing diagnostics and screening. This review highlights recent ML applications in advanced and nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensing, categorized into biocatalytic sensing, affinity&#8208;based sensing, bioreceptor&#8208;free sensing, electrochemiluminescence, high&#8208;throughput sensing, and continuous monitoring. Together, these developments underscore the transformative potential of ML&#8208;aided advanced/nanomaterial&#8208;enhanced electrochemical biosensors in diagnostics and screening, paving new pathways in the field.

         <title>Application of Novel Drug&#8208;Delivery Strategies in Neurological Disorders</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neurological disorders are the top cause of global health loss, but drug development faces major challenges, primarily due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). Other obstacles include gastrointestinal irritation, poor stability, rapid metabolism, imprecise targeting, and toxicity. Emerging drug&#8208;delivery strategies offer promising solutions. This review examines these challenges, explores innovative drug delivery strategies, and discusses their applications in neurological disorders.








Abstract
Neurological disorders are the leading cause of global health loss and disability. However, the success rate of drug development in the nervous system is very low, mainly because of the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB). In addition, gastrointestinal irritation, low stability, rapid metabolism, imprecise targeting, and organ toxicity of drugs are also important constraints in the development and application of neurological drugs. Emerging technologies, such as nano&#8208;delivery technology, offer a number of strategies to address these challenges drugs face entering the central nervous system. This review systematically introduces the various challenges of existing drug development in neurological disorders and summarizes BBB regulation strategies, drug delivery strategies, and modes of administration. It's summarized that the challenges of BBB can be addressed with the help of strategies including physical stimulation and modification of nanocarriers, and drug delivery in the nervous system can be achieved with the help of passive and active nanocarriers and self&#8208;assembly. Moreover, drug delivery strategies in major neurological disorders are discussed in detail. Finally, the limitations of some drug delivery strategies are summarized and the future development direction is prospected, which can provide new ideas and technologies for the optimization of drug delivery for neurological disorders.

         <title>A Fully Integrated Wearable Sweat Sensing Patch for Online Analysis of Multiple Parkinson's Disease&#8208;Related Biomarkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A fully integrated wearable sweat&#8208;sensing patch capable of real&#8208;time detection of three critical PD&#8208;related biomarkers: L&#8208;Dopa, ascorbic acid, and glucose is presented. The system integrates a biomimetic microfluidic module for sedentary sweat collection, an advanced electrochemical sensing platform for biomarker detection, on&#8208;site signal processing circuitry for data handling, and custom software for real&#8208;time data visualization.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is marked by a prolonged asymptomatic &#8220;window period&#8221; (several years). Early prediction and diagnosis during this window are crucial, as timely interventions can slow disease progression. In this study, a fully integrated wearable sweat&#8208;sensing patch capable of real&#8208;time detection of three key PD biomarkers: L&#8208;Dopa, ascorbic acid, and glucose is developed. The system includes a biomimetic microfluidic module for sedentary sweat collection, an advanced electrochemical sensing platform for biomarker analysis, on&#8208;site signal processing circuitry for data management, and custom software for real&#8208;time data visualization. A universal strategy is proposed to significantly extend the stability of oxidase enzymes without activity loss, achieved through the design of Cu&#8208;oxidase hybrid nanoflowers. The patch is successfully tested on dozens of volunteers (healthy and PD patients in various stages), demonstrating its capability to monitor biomarkers in real time, assess PD progression, and optimize medication management.

         <title>Overall Performance Improvement of Perovskite Green LEDs by CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 Nanocrystals and Molecular Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A co&#8208;additive strategy regulates perovskite crystallization, enabling CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 dual&#8208;phase nanocrystals and nanoscale concave&#8208;convex morphology with polarity tuning via molecular doping. The resulting PeLEDs achieve record performance: 28.2% EQE, 4291&#160;h T50 lifetime, 16.5&#160;nm linewidth, and&#160;92% Rec. 2020 gamut coverage, surpassing prior benchmarks in efficiency, stability, and color purity.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites hold great promise for display technologies owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Recent advances in perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have improved their efficiency, brightness, and operational stability, but simultaneously boosting these metrics remains challenging. Additionally, other critical metrics such as power consumption, color purity, and gamut have received little attention. Here, a co&#8208;additive approach is proposed to regulate the perovskite crystallization, enabling the synthesis of CsPbBr3&amp;Cs4PbBr6 dual&#8208;phase nanocrystals (NCs) and the formation of nanoscale concave&#8208;convex morphology, as well as to change its semiconductor polarity by molecular doping. Due to the reduced defect density, balanced charge injection, and improved light extraction efficiency, the PeLEDs achieve a remarkable external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 28.2%, a high brightness of over 150000&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a T50 lifetime of 4291&#160;h, along with an ultra&#8208;narrow spectral linewidth (16.5&#160;nm), an ultra&#8208;low driving voltage (1.9&#160;V), and a superior Rec. 2020 color gamut coverage (CGC) of 92%.

         <title>A Bipolar Solvent Molecule Design for Wide&#8208;Temperature High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An S&#8208;F group is directly grafted onto the SO2 group in the sulfone solvent, enabling rapid defluorination and decomposition of the solvent to form a robust SEI layer dominated by inorganics, thereby effectively isolating the LMA. The design ensures stable operation of Li&#8208;metal full cells from ambient to extreme conditions, offering a novel perspective for the molecular engineering of electrolytes tailored for Li&#8208;metal batteries.








Abstract
Integrating Li metal anode (LMA) with a high&#8208;voltage NCM811 cathode is considered a pragmatic path in the pursuit of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density electrochemical energy storage systems. Yet, their practical application is still plagued by suboptimal cycling behavior. Numerous reports have already upgraded the cycle life of Li metal batteries (LMB) through anion&#8208;derived electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase (EEI), but the adverse consequence brought by the inevitable decomposition of organic solvents is often underestimated. Here, a bipolar solvent molecule (1&#8208;Butanesulfonyl fluoride, BSF), is engineered by fusing an F&#8208;SO2 polar head for dissociating Li salts and contributing to the construction of EEI, along with a (CH2)4 nonpolar tail to lower molecular polarity and enhance wettability. Within the BSF&#8208;based electrolyte, FSI&#8722; anions and BSF coexist in the Li+ solvation shell, jointly contributing to the development of inorganic&#8208;rich EEI. Supported by robust interphases and expedited interfacial kinetics, the Li||NCM811 full cells (N/P = 1.05&#8211;1.8) exhibit favorable electrochemical performance over a wide temperature range from &#8722;40 to +55&#160;&#176;C. Furthermore, a 5.2 Ah Li metal pouch cell with a high cathode loading of 30&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte (1.9&#160;g Ah&#8722;1) delivers an energy density of 470&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and achieves 100 stable cycles.

         <title>Long&#8208;Lifespan and High&#8208;Rate Energy Storage Enabled by Lithium&#8208;Free Batteries with External Li Supply</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lithium&#8208;free battery is designed by integrating a graphite|TiS2 pouch cell with a standard electrolyte modified by lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). Through electrochemical activation, the additive liberates Li ions without compromising structural stability or leaving detrimental residues. An unprecedented cycle life exceeding 14&#8201;000 cycles is achieved at a high current rate of 10C.








Abstract
Energy storage batteries are pivotal for enabling reliable integration of renewable energy systems, yet further advancements in their longevity and rate performance remain imperative. Lithium (Li)&#8208;free cathode materials, while offering exceptional electrochemical stability, rate capability, and cost efficiency, face a critical limitation: the absence of active Li ions when paired with conventional graphite anodes. To address this challenge, a Li&#8208;free battery design is presented that integrates a graphite|TiS2 pouch cell architecture with a standard electrolyte modified by lithium trifluoromethanesulfinate (LiSO2CF3). This additive serves as an in situ Li&#8208;ion reservoir, electrochemically releasing Li ions during operation without generating deleterious residues or compromising structural integrity. The optimized cell achieves an unprecedented cycle life exceeding 14&#8201;000 cycles at a high current rate of 10C, alongside remarkable sustainability and cost&#8208;effectiveness. This work establishes a practical pathway for deploying long&#8208;lasting, fast&#8208;charging Li&#8208;free batteries in grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Cell Surface&#8208;Confined DNAzyme Coordination&#8208;Facilitated Logical Engineering for Precise Cell Identification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work designs a new DNA logical processing strategy based on cell surface&#8208;confined DNAzyme coordination for high&#8208;precision engineering and identification of cells. This strategy integrates the advantage of spatially&#8208;confined DNA&#8208;based reactions and allows for concurrently and logically analyzing multiple cell surface proteins, and demonstrates successful application even in tumor tissues from breast and lung cancer patients.








Abstract
DNA logical processing, which employs DNA as a building block to perform logic operations, attracts considerable attention in biomedical applications. Herein, a new DNA logical processing strategy is explored for selective cell engineering and to develop a feasible technology for precise cell identification. Specifically, this cell identification technology accomplishes logical engineering through the employment of cell surface&#8208;confined DNAzyme coordination, which not only enables the labeling of versatile DNA probes at specific cells but also avoids false&#8208;positive outputs caused by the neighboring non&#8208;target cells. In proof&#8208;of&#8208;principle studies, this cell identification technology achieves precise magnetic isolation and electrochemical determination of specific cancer cells (i.e., stem cell&#8208;like subpopulations in breast cancer). When further applied to tumors taken from mouse models, this technology exhibits accuracy comparable to that of flow cytometry; however, it is simple to operate and offers superior recognition capabilities for revealing multiple biomarkers. More importantly, this cell identification technology can be successfully applied in tumor tissues from breast cancer and lung cancer patients, demonstrating satisfactory practicability. Therefore, this work may provide new insights for the precise identification of cells, especially cancer cells, and is expected to offer technical support for clinical diagnosis and related biomedical research.

         <title>Stiffening Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Liquid Crystal Inclusions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporation of low molecular weight liquid crystals (LC) into liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) leads to a significant increase in their stiffness and output work density. Such remarkable stiffening is attributed to nanoscale phase&#8208;separation and the formation of induced&#8208;smectic domains in polydomain and monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs, respectively.








Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are promising building blocks for soft robots, given their large, programmable, reversible, and stimuli&#8208;responsive shape change. Enhancing LCEs&#8217; stiffness and toughness has been a longstanding desire previously explored by reinforcing them with fillers, crystalline microdomains, and interpenetrating polymer networks. While promising, these methods adversely affect molecular order and thermal strain. Here, a significant enhancement of the&#160;stiffness of LCEs is reported by loading them with low molecular weight liquid crystals (LMWLCs) without sacrificing thermal strain and molecular order. While pristine LCEs rapidly transition to a soft elastic plateau when strained from poly&#8208; to monodomain, LC&#8208;loaded samples (LC&#8208;LCEs) first experience a pronounced linear elasticity, followed by a soft elastic plateau at higher stresses. Further thermomechanical and X&#8208;ray analysis confirm the emergence of an additional mesophase in polydomain LC&#8208;LCEs, which evolves to short&#8208;range smectic (cybotactic) during the poly&#8208; to monodomain transition. Monodomain LC&#8208;LCEs show between 6.5&#8208; and 9.0&#8208;fold stiffness enhancement with improved molecular order and thermal strain. Their work densities are more than double that of pristine LCEs, with active thermal stroke of up to 25% under loads of over 2000 times their weight. Such remarkable behaviors are attributed to the interplay between post&#8208;polymerization phase separation of LCs and their strain&#8208;enhanced smectic ordering. The results suggest that LMWLC inclusion can be a simple yet robust method to significantly improve the mechanical properties of LCEs.

     alt="Stiffening Liquid Crystal Elastomers with Liquid Crystal Inclusions"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incorporation of low molecular weight liquid crystals (LC) into liquid crystal elastomers (LCE) leads to a significant increase in their stiffness and output work density. Such remarkable stiffening is attributed to nanoscale phase-separation and the formation of induced-smectic domains in polydomain and monodomain LC-LCEs, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are promising building blocks for soft robots, given their large, programmable, reversible, and stimuli-responsive shape change. Enhancing LCEs&#8217; stiffness and toughness has been a longstanding desire previously explored by reinforcing them with fillers, crystalline microdomains, and interpenetrating polymer networks. While promising, these methods adversely affect molecular order and thermal strain. Here, a significant enhancement of the&#160;stiffness of LCEs is reported by loading them with low molecular weight liquid crystals (LMWLCs) without sacrificing thermal strain and molecular order. While pristine LCEs rapidly transition to a soft elastic plateau when strained from poly- to monodomain, LC-loaded samples (LC-LCEs) first experience a pronounced linear elasticity, followed by a soft elastic plateau at higher stresses. Further thermomechanical and X-ray analysis confirm the emergence of an additional mesophase in polydomain LC-LCEs, which evolves to short-range smectic (cybotactic) during the poly- to monodomain transition. Monodomain LC-LCEs show between 6.5- and 9.0-fold stiffness enhancement with improved molecular order and thermal strain. Their work densities are more than double that of pristine LCEs, with active thermal stroke of up to 25% under loads of over 2000 times their weight. Such remarkable behaviors are attributed to the interplay between post-polymerization phase separation of LCs and their strain-enhanced smectic ordering. The results suggest that LMWLC inclusion can be a simple yet robust method to significantly improve the mechanical properties of LCEs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Intranasal and Intravenous Sequential Administration of Survivin Peptide&#8208;CpG Nanovaccines Elicits Potent Immunity Toward Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A survivin peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccine, SPOD&#8208;NV, is designed for GBM immunotherapy. Using a strategic sequential administration through intranasal and intravenous routes, it capitalizes on the advantages of both methods exhibiting enhanced accumulation in tumors, NALT, CLNs and spleen. Combined with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 therapy, it effectively activates local and systemic T&#8208;cell and humoral responses, achieving 43% complete remission and long&#8208;lasting immune memory in orthotopic GBM models.








Abstract
Peptide vaccines hold great promise for treatment of glioblastoma (GBM), though their efficacy remains suboptimal due to factors such as immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, poor accessibility to tumor site and inadequate activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells. Here, this work reports on survivin peptide&#8208;CpG oligodeoxynucleotide (ODN) nanovaccines (SPOD&#8208;NV), which feature antigen peptides strategically displayed on polymersomes with CpG ODN encapsulated as an immunostimulatory adjuvant. Sequential administration via intranasal and intravenous routes elicits robust immune response against murine GBM. These results demonstrate that SPOD&#8208;NV significantly enhances mucosa penetration and markedly improves dendritic cell uptake and activation. Notably, the intranasal administration of SPOD&#8208;NV to orthotopic murine GL261 tumor models reveals marked accumulation in cervical lymph nodes and tumors, likely facilitated by lymphatic transport from nasal mucosa and pathways via olfactory bulb and trigeminal nerve, bypassing the blood&#8208;brain barrier. Interestingly, the therapeutic strategy, comprising three intranasal and two intravenous administrations of SPOD&#8208;NV in combination with anti&#8208;CTLA&#8208;4 antibody, results in substantial tumor inhibition, achieving a 43% complete regression rate, in line with the stimulation of robust and long&#8208;lasting local and systemic anti&#8208;GBM immune responses. These intranasal&#8208;intravenous administration strategy of peptide&#8208;CpG nanovaccines provides a potential curative therapy for brain tumors, paving the way for further developments in GBM immunotherapy.

         <title>Pyrolysis&#8208;Free Covalent Organic Polymer Efficiently Driving Proton&#8208;Exchange&#8208;Membrane Fuel Cells by Covalent Grafting Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent grafting strategy is proposed to fabricate a lamellar COP network COP@G, which is achieved by edge&#8208;functionalizing COP with aromatic primary amine groups, followed by diazotization reactions and covalent attachment of graphene dispersions. COP@G demonstrates an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in maximum power density compared to van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;carbon composites in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cell device.








Abstract
Covalent organic polymers (COPs) have emerged as promising oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) catalysts due to their structural tunability and well&#8208;defined active sites. However, their practical application is hindered by inherent electrical conductivity and restricted active site accessibility in bulk configurations. While van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;carbon composites enhance conductivity, persistent stacking, and weak interfaces still impede electron/mass transport during ORR. Herein, a covalent grafting strategy is proposed to fabricate a lamellar COP network COP@G, which is achieved by edge&#8208;functionalizing COP with aromatic primary amine groups, followed by diazotization reactions and covalent attachment of graphene dispersions. The resulting hybrid exhibits significantly improved active site accessibility and a tenfold increase in conductivity compared to pristine COP. As a result, in 0.1&#160;M HClO4, COP@G delivers an exceptional acidic ORR performance, with a record half&#8208;wave potential of 801&#160;mV, surpassing van der Waals&#8208;assembled COP&#8208;G by 194&#160;mV. When integrated into proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) cathodes, COP@G demonstrates an order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude enhancement in maximum power density compared to conventional COP&#8208;carbon composites.

         <title>Precisely Tuning 3D/Quasi&#8208;2D Perovskite Heterojunctions in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskites for High&#8208;Performance Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this research, 3D/2D or 3D/quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterojunctions with tunable energy levels and uniform n&#8208;values are developed. The well&#8208;refined heterogeneous structure effectively mitigates the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses and facilitates carrier extraction at the WBG perovskite/C60 interface. As a result, the optimized WBG PSCs and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells exhibit improved performance and stability.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite sub&#8208;cells in all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (AP&#8208;TSCs) suffer from severe open&#8208;circuit voltage loss and poor light stability. The formation of 3D/2D or 3D/quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterojunctions can effectively passivate interface defects and optimize energy level alignments at the 3D perovskite/C60 interface, thereby enhancing both the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Herein, a combined evaporation/solution technique is employed to construct Dion&#8208;Jacobson (DJ) 2D or quasi&#8208;2D perovskites with uniform&#8208;phase distribution on wide&#8208;bandgap 3D perovskite substrates. By tuning the n values of the DJ phase perovskites, well&#8208;refined WBG 3D/2D or quasi&#8208;2D perovskite heterostructures are achieved, which exhibit tunable energy levels and mitigate the non&#8208;radiative recombination losses at the WBG 3D perovskite/C60 interface. The devices with the WBG (1.78&#160;eV) 3D/quasi&#8208;2D n = 3 perovskite heterostructures achieve the champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.71% (certified 20.53%). When combined with narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) perovskite sub&#8208;cells, the fabricated 2&#8208;terminal AP&#8208;TSCs achieve a PCE of 28.99% (certified 28.81%). The tandem device maintains 80% of its initial PCE after 501&#160;h of operation at maximum power point.

         <title>Directly Evolved Nanovaccines Modulate Disrupted Circadian Rhythm and Enhance Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Directly evolved biovesicles are developed as biological clock&#8208;modulated nanovaccines (Clock&#8208;NVs) to augment circadian gene expression in tumors, enhance mitochondrial metabolism and antigen processing in dendritic cells for amplified antitumor immune responses, and potentiate the antitumor efficiency of anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 and adoptive T cells in multiple cancer mice models.








Abstract
The circadian rhythm, as a crucial endogenous biological oscillator, often undergoes disruptions, thus fostering severe immunosuppression within tumors. Here, this work develops directly evolved biovesicles as biological clock&#8208;modulated nanovaccines (Clock&#8208;NVs) to augment circadian clock gene expression and enhance cancer immunotherapy. These biovesicles act as bioreactors, transforming an unfavorable factor, ROS, into a beneficial circadian clock enhancer, oxygen. By targeting HIF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;BMAL1 axis, Clock&#8208;NVs restore the disrupted circadian rhythm within tumors. Upregulation of the core clock gene, BMAL1, initiates tumor cell death, enhances mitochondrial metabolism and antigen processing in dendritic cells to amplify antitumor immune responses. Clock&#8208;NVs effectively inhibit tumor growth, diminish metastasis, and demonstrate robust antitumor activity in a model of chemotherapy&#8208;resistant senescent tumors. Notably, Clock&#8208;NVs combined with adoptive T cell&#8208;based therapies achieve a 60% regression of primary tumors, while their use with anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 results in 100% inhibition of tumor recurrence. This strategy introduces nanovaccines designed to enhance temporal immunotherapy by precisely restoring the suppressed rhythm gene expression within tumors.

         <title>Designing Physical Unclonable Functions From Optically Active Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Assigning unforgeable &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; to manufactured goods is a key strategy to fight global counterfeiting. Optical physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are chemically generated random patterns of optically active materials serving as unique authenticators. Here, recent advances in optical PUF devices are presented for anticounterfeiting via an overview of available optical taggants and compatible fabrication techniques.








Abstract
Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are artificial &#8220;fingerprints&#8221; provided by physical devices to authenticate manufactured goods. Their inherent unclonable nature positions them as one of the most promising tools to tackle global counterfeiting challenges. Leveraging the large parameter space in solution chemistry, chemically generated PUFs can achieve excellent device performance. Particularly, optically active materials have become valuable security inks thanks to their versatile, non&#8208;invasive, and non&#8208;destructive readouts, and PUF devices generated from stochastic nano&#8208;/micro&#8208;patterns of optical inks hold great potential. This review highlights recent advances in the design of optical PUF devices. A range of resonant and non&#8208;resonant optical materials used as security taggants are presented and their incorporation in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PUF devices is examined using non&#8208;deterministic fabrication techniques. By outlining design criteria, challenges, and opportunities, a roadmap is provided for developing next&#8208;generation PUFs using established and emerging optical probes and help advance security and reliability in anticounterfeiting technologies.

         <title>De Novo Design of Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 Modulating Proteins to Enhance Biomaterial Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NeoNectins are de novo&#8208;designed miniproteins that selectively bind and stabilize the extended open form of integrin &#945;5&#946;1. When grafted onto biomaterials including hydrogel and titanium, they promote cell attachment and spreading in vitro and promoting tissue integration and bone growth in animal models, demonstrating broad potential for regenerative medicine and biomaterials.








Abstract
Integrin &#945;5&#946;1 is crucial for cell attachment and migration in development and tissue regeneration, and &#945;5&#946;1 binding proteins can have considerable utility in regenerative medicine and next&#8208;generation therapeutics. We use computational protein design&#160;to create de novo &#945;5&#946;1&#8208;specific modulating miniprotein binders, called NeoNectins, that bind to and stabilize the open state of &#945;5&#946;1. When immobilized onto titanium surfaces and throughout 3D hydrogels, the NeoNectins outperform native fibronectin (FN) and RGD peptides in enhancing cell attachment and spreading, and NeoNectin&#8208;grafted titanium implants outperformed FN&#8208; and RGD&#8208;grafted implants in animal models in promoting tissue integration and bone growth. NeoNectins should be broadly applicable for tissue engineering and biomedicine.

         <title>Observation of N&#233;el&#8208;Skyrmions in Bilayered Oxide Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study elucidates the evolution of ferroelectric skyrmion&#8208;bubbles with thickness, revealing pure N&#233;el&#8208;type ferroelectric skyrmions in ultrathin bilayer oxide films. The stability of these pure N&#233;el&#8208;type skyrmions is primarily governed by electric and gradient energy variations, establishing them as the electrical counterparts of magnetic skyrmions and pushing the size limits of topological phases.








Abstract
Skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials exhibit either N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics. Although skyrmions in ferromagnetic materials can be readily obtained via inter&#8208;spin interactions, a skyrmion in ferroelectric materials exhibiting solely N&#233;el or Bloch characteristics has not yet been discovered. Here, by modulating the formation of skyrmion&#8208;bubbles in [(PbTiO3)n/(SrTiO3)n]1 [(PTOn/STOn)1] bilayers grown on STO substrates, the atomic morphology of pure N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmion is observed with a topological charge of &#177; 1 in the ultrathin bilayered films with the thickness of 2 unit cells (u.c.). Such a pure N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmion is confirmed by a combination of atomic mappings, geometric phase analysis, and X&#8208;ray 3D reciprocal space mapping (RSM). It is found that decreasing the thickness of bilayered films from 50 to 2 u.c., the characteristics of skyrmion&#8208;bubbles exhibiting both N&#233;el and Bloch features disappear along with the Bloch features. The formation mechanism of the N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmions is unveiled using Phase&#8208;field simulations, showing the critical role of electric and gradient energy variation in the stable phase of N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmions. These nanoscale pure N&#233;el&#8208;skyrmions represent the electrical equivalents of their magnetic counterparts, extending the size limits of topological phases and offering potential advancements in the field of ferroelectric physics.

         <title>Magnetically Controlled Mechanical Cutting of Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study introduces a transformative strategy of mechanical cutting water by magnetically manipulating a hydrophobic sphere moving across hydrophobic particles&#8208;encapsulated water (HPEW). The patterned HPEWs manufactured by mechanical cutting are designed as open millifluidic chips with various interdisciplinary applications in biochemical assays, chemical synthesis, and 3D cell culture.








Abstract
Precisely controlling the cutting of water using mechanical forces remains challenging due to water's inherent surface tension and rapid self&#8208;healing properties. Inspired by the effortless movement of water striders, a strategy is developed involving magnetic manipulation of a hydrophobic sphere across hydrophobic particle&#8208;encapsulated water (HPEW). Stable mechanical cutting of water is first demonstrated by coating its surface with hydrophobic particles (silica nanoparticles, paraffin, and polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)) and maintaining the water thickness below 1&#160;mm. Through systematic theoretical and numerical analyses, it is clarified how water thickness and particle distribution influence cutting performance and accuracy. Moreover, a magnetically controlled approach is established for precise cutting, creating versatile open millifluidic chips suitable for diverse applications such as biochemical assays, chemical synthesis, and 3D cell culture. The approach thus offers a robust platform with wide&#8208;ranging implications in materials science, chemistry, physics, biomedical engineering, and microfluidics.

         <title>A Polychromatic Neuromorphic Visual System Inspired by Biomimetics for Miniature Insect Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) for neuromorphic electronics, enabling ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection and low&#8208;energy near&#8208;infrared perception with bio&#8208;synaptic features. A neuromorphic visual system based on BHJ&#8208;OPS that can sense visual information and coordinate movements in response to environmental stimuli is successfully achieved.








Abstract
The emergence of electronics influenced by visual neural perception and action is increasingly crucial for enhancing interactive human&#8208;machine interfaces and advancing the capabilities of intelligent robots. There is an urgent demand for a system that incorporates neuromorphic environmental information encoding, synaptic signal processing, and motion control. Taking inspiration from the polychromatic visual system, it is initially employed bulk heterojunction organic photosynapses (BHJ&#8208;OPS) to replicate the functionalities of human&#8208;like visual nerve system. The BHJ&#8208;OPS, utilizing a two&#8208;terminal architecture, exhibits an ultra&#8208;broadband photodetection range (365&#8211;1060&#160;nm). For near&#8208;infrared (NIR) perception, an optical energy consumption as low as 0.2 fJ per synaptic event is demonstrated, which is the lowest energy consumption achieved so far with NIR light stimulation. By combining the photovoltaic effect in heterojunctions with electron trapping in the buffer layer, BHJ&#8208;OPS displays bio&#8208;synaptic characteristics such as short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory, as well as experiential learning, which endows the synapse array with multispectral color&#8208;discrimination capabilities. Finally, it is implemented miniature insect robots capable of night&#8208;time foraging and predator evasion based on a simulated 26 &#215; 26 memristor network. This demonstrates significant potential for the development of miniature insect robots with self&#8208;regulation and adaptability, particularly in exploration, monitoring, and rescue missions.

This demonstrates significant potential for the development of miniature insect robots with self-regulation and adaptability, particularly in exploration, monitoring, and rescue missions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Practical Photo&#8208;Assisted Li&#8208;O2 Batteries: a Four&#8208;Electron Pathway Enabled by Ru&#8208;Doped &#946;&#8208;MnO2</title>

         <dc:description>
Doping Ru into the interstices of &#946;&#8208;MnO2 significantly enhances the performance as a photocathode for photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries. In a simulated oxygen environment with 57% relative humidity, the batteries achieved an exceptional round&#8208;trip efficiency of 98.4%, a prolonged cycling lifespan exceeding 720 h, and stable operation at a high current density of 1000 mA g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 batteries, which utilize solar energy to reduce overpotentials, have attracted significant interest. However, challenges such as sluggish redox kinetics, limited photogenerated carrier availability, excessive byproduct formation, and oxygen evolution constraints persist. This study integrates computational and experimental approaches to demonstrate that Ru doping at interstitial sites in &#946;&#8208;MnO2 induces lattice expansion, introduces additional reactive sites, enhances light absorption, and accelerates redox reaction kinetics. Under simulated conditions (57% relative humidity), the battery achieves an impressive 98.4% round&#8208;trip efficiency, excellent high&#8208;rate performance, and exceptional cycling stability over 720 h with reversible four&#8208;electron conversion to LiOH. Furthermore, stable operation under real atmospheric conditions marks the first demonstration of a photo&#8208;assisted Li&#8208;O2 battery based on a four&#8208;electron process. These findings provide new insights into advancing the practical implementation of Li&#8208;O2 batteries for efficient energy storage applications.

         <title>C15&#8208;Phase Platinum&#8208;Lanthanide Intermetallics for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution: Identifying Lanthanide's Enhanced Mechanism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The carbon&#8208;supported Pt2Ln intermetallics are efficiently and rapidly synthesized using Joule heating technology, exhibiting excellent electrocatalytic performance for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). It is demonstrated that the Ln sites, due to the high oxophilicity and strong orbital hybridization, play a key role in enhancing HER performance by regulating both the adsorption/dissociation of H2O and the desorption of H* intermediates.









Abstract
Platinum&#8208;Lanthanide (Pt&#8208;Ln) intermetallic compounds (IMCs) are a promising new class of electrocatalytic materials, yet their synthesis remains a significant challenge, and the role of ordered Ln sites in enhancing catalytic performance is not fully understood. Herein, an effective and rapid avenue for synthesizing carbon&#8208;supported C15&#8208;phase Pt2Ln IMCs (Ln: Sm, Eu, Gd, and Tb) through Joule heating technology is proposed. The JH&#8208;Pt2Ln/C IMCs exhibit excellent electrocatalytic performance toward alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), in which JH&#8208;Pt2Tb/C presents the lowest overpotential of 17&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. The ordered Pt2Tb structure offers favorable Pt2 dimer sites for the desorption of H* intermediates, in contrast to the Pt3 trimer sites in disordered Pt2Tb and pure Pt. The ordered Tb sites play a bifunctional role in HER: i) The oxophilic Tb atoms are in favor of the H2O adsorption and dissociation through Tb&#8208;4f&#8208;OH binding; ii) The strong Tb 4f&#8208;Pt 5d orbital hybridization leads to form negatively charged Pt sites, which promotes the desorption of H* intermediates. Furthermore, the anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer equipped with JH&#8208;Pt2Tb/C delivers a low voltage of only 1.79 Vcell to reach 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 and maintains the stable operation at 1&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 for over 100&#160;h.

         <title>Lightweight and Superelastic Wood Carbon Sponges Enabled by Wood Cell Wall Reconfiguration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;stripping&#8208;expansion&#8208;carbonization&#8221; strategy is proposed to reconstruct the cell wall architecture and fabricate a lightweight, superelastic wood carbon sponge. The core of this strategy lies in disrupting weak interlayer connections and establishing a stable wavy lamellar structure through cell wall softening and vacuum&#8208;assisted expansion. This wood carbon sponge with exceptional performance serves as a versatile platform for applications in sensing, electromagnetic interferenceshielding, oil absorption, and beyond.








Abstract
Elastic wood carbon sponges have gained increasing momentum due to their combination of compressive elasticity, wood orientation structure, and carbon nature. However, the pursuit of lightweight and superelasticity in these sponges remains a significant challenge, as their boundaries are constrained by the solidified wood cell walls. Here, an innovative &#8220;stripping&#8208;expansion&#8208;carbonization&#8221; strategy is proposed for producing wood carbon sponges with low density and superelasticity via breaking the spatial confinement of the original cell wall. This strategy integrates the removal of non&#8208;skeletal components from cell wall, the formation of bubble&#8208;assisted lamellar structure, and a high&#8208;temperature carbonization process. The resultant expanded wood carbon sponges (EWCS) demonstrate a low density of 14.18 &#177; 1.07 mg cm&#8722;3, temperature&#8208;insensitive superelasticity, and reliable cycling stability. Additionally, the incorporation of the lightweight, electrical conductivity, and superelasticity nature endows EWCS with remarkable versatility, enabling applications such as pressure sensor for monitoring human movement, tunable electromagnetic interference shielding, and efficient and recyclable oil&#8208;water separation. This strategy realizes the layer&#8208;wise reconfiguration of the solid wood cell structure, providing a new design route for engineering wood carbon sponges.

         <title>Schottky MSM&#8208;Structured Tribovoltaic Nanogenerator Enabling Over 25,000 nC Charge Transfer via Single Droplet Impact</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tribovoltaic nanogenerator featuring a Schottky MSM architecture utilizes triboelectric potential to modulate carrier transport. The device leverages interfacial state density and surface conductance engineering to maintain a tunable Schottky barrier. This strategy enables high charge output per droplet and rapid energy storage, showing potential for scalable and practical energy harvesting applications.








Abstract
Using water droplets to generate electricity is an attractive approach for addressing the energy crisis. However, achieving high charge transfer and power output in such systems remains a major challenge. Here, a tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG) is developed based on a specially designed Schottky metal&#8208;semiconductor&#8208;metal (MSM) structure. This device is capable of efficiently converting the kinetic energy of water droplets into electricity. To improve performance, a patterned interface layer between the metal and semiconductor is introduced, which helps guide charge flow and control surface conductivity. Upon droplet impact, the mechanical friction between the liquid and the surface generates a potential that activates charge transport across the Schottky barrier. This breaks the equilibrium state and enhances carrier movement. As a result, the device achieves a record&#8208;high charge output of 25500&#160;nC from a single droplet, along with an output energy of 5.8&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8315;&#8310;&#160;J. To showcase scalability, a TVNG module with 60 cells on a 3&#8208;inch wafer delivers milliamp&#8208;level current and charges a 220&#160;&#181;F capacitor to 0.6&#160;V within 2&#160;s. The effects of processing, materials, structure, and droplet properties are studied to guide the future design of high&#8208;efficiency Schottky MSM&#8208;based TVNG.

         <title>Phonon Driven Ferroelectricity and Raman Active Modes in Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Ferroelectric domains, a hallmark of ferroelectricity, are studied using temperature&#8208;dependent Raman spectroscopy to uncover characteristic phonons associated with ferroelectric phase transitions in different n&#8208;value HOIPs. Higher n&#8208;value HOIP demonstrate a reduced ferroelectric switching energy barrier, providing valuable insights for optimizing domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
Hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising ferroelectric semiconductors, yet the phonon signatures governing their ferroelectricity remain poorly understood. Here, by analyzing the temperature&#8208;dependent Raman peak profiles of highly ordered ferroelectric domains in HOIPs, a framework to systematically investigate the dimensionality (n)&#8208;dependent phonons that are critical to ferroelectric behaviour is established. By tracking phonon evolution across the ferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;paraelectric phase transition in HOIPs with different n, characteristic modes associated with the ferroelectric symmetry&#8208;breaking process are identified. Notably, in the ferroelectric phase of (BA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 (n = 3), these modes exhibit a redshift compared to those in (BA)2(MA)Pb2Br7 (n = 2), reflecting a reduced energy barrier for ferroelectric switching. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations further correlate these modes with their spectral signatures in Raman spectroscopy, particularly highlighting zone&#8208;boundary modes that diminish upon transitioning to the paraelectric phase. Polarized Raman mapping further reveals adjacent ferroelectric domains with orthogonal polarization orientations, directly linking phonon activity to domain configuration. This work elucidates the role of phonons in HOIP ferroelectricity, offering insights for tailoring domain&#8208;related properties in ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Probing the Effect of Electrode Thermodynamics on Reaction Heterogeneity in Thick Battery Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thick electrodes promise higher battery energy density but suffer from reaction heterogeneity. While typically attributed to sluggish charge transport, this study shows how thermodynamic properties of active materials also have critical influence. Through advanced X&#8208;ray characterization of LiFePO4 and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 thick electrodes, stark differences in their reaction gradients are revealed and a predictive metric to guide electrode design is introduced.








Abstract
Thick electrodes present a viable strategy for enhancing energy density and reducing manufacturing costs of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, reaction heterogeneity during cycling compromises their rate capability and cycle life. While this nonuniformity is commonly attributed to sluggish charge transport, it is demonstrated here that the thermodynamic properties of the electrode material play an equally critical role. Through combined X&#8208;ray fluorescence microscopy and absorption near&#8208;edge structure spectroscopy, reaction distributions in LiFePO4 (LFP) and LiNi0.6Mn0.2Co0.2O2 (NMC) thick electrodes with matched porosity and tortuosity are compared. LFP electrodes develop pronounced depth&#8208;oriented state&#8208;of&#8208;charge (SOC) gradients that worsen with increasing discharge rates, whereas NMC maintains much more uniform SOC distributions under such conditions. This difference originates from their distinct SOC dependence of equilibrium potentials and is quantifiable through a dimensionless &#8220;reaction uniformity&#8221; number. Intriguingly, LFP thick electrodes also exhibit lateral SOC variations that strengthen during slow discharge. The enhanced reaction uniformity in NMC correlates with better active material utilization and slower capacity fade than LFP, highlighting electrode thermodynamics as a key design consideration for thick electrodes.

         <title>Cloud Inspired White and Grey Plasmonic Metasurfaces for Camouflaged Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by clouds' role in Earth's thermal management, this work presents disordered plasmonic metasurfaces that mimic their radiative effects. The white metasurface enhances backscattering, acting as a cooling layer with camouflage properties. The grey state suppresses backscattering and enhances light trapping, surpassing conventional black absorbers. These metasurfaces enable advancements in camouflage, low&#8208;emissivity coatings, and thermal infrared stealth technologies.








Abstract
Inspired by nature's color&#8208;driven thermal regulation mechanisms and the atmospheric radiative effects of cloud&#8208;aerosol interactions, this work presents the design of disordered metasurfaces capable of achieving white and grey plasmonic colors. This innovation advances light and thermal management technologies within the framework of stealth and camouflage applications. The white plasmonic metasurfaces emulate the cooling effects of clouds, reducing substrate temperatures by a relative &#8722;10&#160;&#176;C under standard solar illumination through backscattering. In contrast, transitioning to a grey state with a nanocomposite absorber suppresses backscattering and enables efficient light trapping, resulting in a relative +10 &#160;&#176;C temperature increase compared to conventional black absorbers. These findings introduce a novel approach to localized thermal management, distinct from traditional passive cooling strategies that rely on high&#8208;emissivity materials. The metasurfaces&#8217; low&#8208;emissivity properties and visible appearance open opportunities in advanced camouflage, stealth technologies, and thermal energy solutions. Additionally, the scalable, sustainable design, realized through all&#8208;in&#8208;chamber nanofabrication via sputtering, eliminates the need for chemically intensive synthesis methods while ensuring long&#8208;term stability.

         <title>Manipulating Ferroelectric Topological Polar Structures with Twisted Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
We demonstrate dynamic control of ferroelectric order in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 using twisted ultraviolet light carrying orbital angular momentum. Our approach harnesses non&#8208;resonant multiphoton absorption and induced strain to modulate topological of ferroelectric polarization textures. In&#8208;situ X&#8208;ray coherent imaging and Raman spectroscopy reveal reversible, nanoscale polarization transitions, enabling efficient stabilization of topological solitons and paving the way for novel optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
The dynamic control of non&#8208;equilibrium states represents a central challenge in condensed matter physics. While intense terahertz fields drive metal&#8208;insulator transitions and ferroelectricity via soft phonon modes, recent theory suggests that twisted light with orbital angular momentum (OAM) offers a distinct route to manipulate ferroelectric order and stabilize topological excitations including skyrmions, vortices, and Hopfions. Control of ferroelectric polarization in quasi&#8208;2D CsBiNb2O7 (CBNO) is demonstrated using non&#8208;resonant twisted ultra&#8208;violet (UV) light (375 nm, 800 THz). Combining in situ X&#8208;ray Bragg coherent diffractive imaging (BCDI), twisted optical Raman spectroscopy, and density functional theory (DFT), three&#8208;dimensional (3D) ionic displacements, strain fields, and polarization changes are resolved in single crystals. Operando measurements reveal light&#8208;induced strain hysteresis under twisted light&#8211;a hallmark of nonlinear, history&#8208;dependent ferroelastic switching driven by OAM. Discrete, irreversible domain transitions emerge as the topological charge &#8467; is cycled, stabilizing non&#8208;trivial domain textures including vortex&#8208;antivortex pairs, Bloch/anti&#8208;Bloch points, and merons. These persist after OAM removal, indicating a memory effect. Competing mechanisms are discussed, including multiphoton absorption, strain&#8208;mediated polarization switching, and defect&#8208;wall interactions. The findings establish structured light as a tool for deterministic, reversible control of ferroic states, enabling optically reconfigurable non&#8208;volatile&#160;devices.

         <title>Catalytically Active Light Printed Microstructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The fabrication of micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;scale 3D&#8208;printed multi&#8208;material structures incorporating photocatalytically active Ru(II) sites using a dual&#8208;function photoresin is introduced. The system utilizes a Ru(II)&#8208;functionalized monomer, enabling the assembly of 3D structures with commercially available crosslinkers. The catalytic activity is demonstrated through the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides.








Abstract
Light&#8208;induced additive manufacturing (3D printing) has revolutionized manufacturing and its integration into the fabrication of catalysts holds key potential to enable facile access to optimized catalyst geometries and designs. Herein &#8211; for the first time &#8211; micro&#8208; and macro&#8208;sized photocatalytically active 3D printed objects are introduced via a dual&#8208;function photoresin using a ruthenium(II) complex containing monomer as both a photoinitiator for the 3D printing process and as the active photocatalyst within the printed structure. The approach leverages the spatial and temporal control afforded by light&#8208;induced 3D printing techniques during both one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon printing to precisely position the photocatalyst within intricate geometries using a pentaerythritol triacrylate (PETA) based resin. The successful incorporation of ruthenium(II) complexes is demonstrated via time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry (ToF&#8208;SIMS) into desired sections of 3D&#8208;printed objects. The one&#8208; and two&#8208;photon fabricated architectures show photocatalytic activity in the C&#9472;H arylation of activated aryl bromides. The potential of tailored catalytically active 3D objects is exemplified by one of the microscale designs. This design, utilizing only 1% of the volume of a macroscale structure fabricated from the same resin, achieved 75% of the photocatalytic performance.

         <title>Atmospheric Water Sorption&#8211;Desorption as a Pathway for Green Energy Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive discussion on the energy conversion from the process of sorption and desorption of water molecules. By detailing the mechanism studies, guidelines are provided for the performance enhancement in the sequence of energy conversion. It provides insights into understanding the recent advances of hydrovoltaic technology and leads to future improvement of the harnessed energy.








Abstract
Beyond the indispensable resource for living creatures, water has recently been explored as an eco&#8208;friendly source of energy, known as the hydrovoltaic technology. Of significant interest, the cyclic sorption/desorption of water molecules physically and chemically induces the gaseous/liquid&#8211;solid interactions with the substances, demonstrating potential for harnessing electricity. Existing efforts have focused on materials engineering and structural design of the energy generators, enhancing the generated electricity for real&#8208;life applications. Despite the substantial achievements, the principal interpretation of the process from water molecules to electricity establishes the foundation and serves as the guidance for device modification and performance enhancement. Herein, this review thoroughly discusses the energy conversion, from the introduction of water molecules to the generation of electricity, starting with an understanding of the sorption/desorption of water molecules. Mechanisms in charge creation from the interaction are then elucidated, where water molecules themselves serve as ions or stimulate ion dissociation from the substances. It continues with an overview of the existing advancements in sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity generation and practical demonstrations of the developed electricity. Based on the conversion procedure, insights for upcoming generator designs are proposed subsequently. Finally, present challenges to be addressed and perspectives on future development in the sorption/desorption&#8208;induced electricity are discussed in detail.

         <title>Data Readout Techniques for DNA&#8208;Based Information Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a universal genetic material, DNA can inherently encode and transmit information. Various DNA data storage systems are reported as attractive alternatives to current digital data storage media. This review provides a detailed analysis of the characteristics and evolution of readout techniques of DNA storage systems, and discusses challenges and opportunities in readout techniques of DNA data storage systems.








Abstract
DNA is a natural chemical substrate that carries genetic information, which also serves as a powerful toolkit for storing digital data. Compared to traditional&#160;storage media, DNA molecules offer higher storage density, longer lifespan, and lower maintenance energy consumption. In DNA storage process, data readout is a critical step that bridges the gap between DNA molecular/structures with stored digital information. With the continued development of strategies in DNA data storage technology, the readout techniques have evolved. However, there is a lack of systematic introduction and discussion on the readout techniques for reported DNA data storage systems, especially the correlation between the design of the data storage system and the corresponding selection of readout techniques. This review first introduces two main categories of DNA data storage units (i.e., sequence and structure) and their corresponding readout techniques (i.e., sequencing and nonsequencing methods), and then reviewed representative examples of notable advancements in DNA data storage technology, focusing on data storage unit design, and readout technique selection. It also introduces emerging approaches to assist data readout techniques, such as implementation of microfluidic and fluorescent probes. Finally, the paper discusses the limitations, challenges, and potential of DNA data readout approaches.

This review provides a holistic overview of biopolymers&#8208;derived electronic skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins), highlighting their exceptional attributes, nature&#8208;inspired engineering constructions, promising applications, and remaining fundamental and technical challenges. These insights provide a design framework to provoke the advancement of e&#8208;skins with high adaptivity, mechanical robustness, and sustainability that contribute to the development of high&#8208;performance wearable electronic systems.








Abstract
The past few years have witnessed the rapid exploration of natural and synthetic materials to construct electronic skins (e&#8208;skins) to emulate the multisensory functions of human skins driven by promising applications. Among various materials employed in functional e&#8208;skins, biopolymers are particularly notable for their exceptional biocompatibility and abundant resources. Despite remarkable progress in engineering biopolymeric materials, a timely and holistic review focusing on the design, synthesis, and modification of biopolymers tailored for biopolymers&#8208;derived e&#8208;skins (Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins) is lacking. In this review, the key attributes of biopolymers are introduced&#160;to establish a fundamental understanding fordeveloping functional Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins. Next, the recent progress in harnessing various natural and synthetic biopolymers as building blocks for constructing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins is systematically discussed, providing insights into maximizing the distinctive attributes of biopolymers. Subsequently, the benefits of nature&#8208;inspired Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins achieved through heterogeneous composite and structural engineering are highlighted, infusing fresh momentum into the advancement of e&#8208;skins. Then, the promising applications of Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins in multisensory functions are summarized, including both local monitoring and remote teleoperation, as well as sustainable energy harvesting that empowers e&#8208;skins. Finally, the remaining fundamental and technical challenges in advancing Bp&#8208;E&#8208;Skins are presented to provoke future designs that emulate and even go beyond human skins.

         <title>Functional Biomaterials Derived from Protein Liquid&#8211;Liquid Phase Separation and Liquid&#8208;to&#8208;Solid Transition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Protein can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation and liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid transition to form liquid condensates and solid aggregates. These phase transitions can be influenced by post&#8208;translational modifications, mutations, and various environmental factors. Effective modulation of protein phase behavior offers promising applications in drug discovery, delivery, and fabrication of multifunctional protein&#8208;based liquid and solid materials.








Abstract
Protein phase transitions play a vital role in both cellular functions and pathogenesis. Dispersed proteins can undergo liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation to form condensates, a process that is reversible and highly regulated within cells. The formation and physicochemical properties of these condensates, such as composition, viscosity, and multiphase miscibility, are precisely modulated to fulfill specific biological functions. However, protein condensates can undergo a further liquid&#8208;to&#8208;solid state, forming &#946;&#8208;sheet&#8208;rich aggregates that may disrupt cellular function and lead to diseases. While this phenomenon is crucial for biological processes and has significant implications for neurodegenerative diseases, the phase behavior of naturally derived or engineered proteins and polypeptides also presents opportunities for developing high&#8208;performance, multifunctional materials at various scales. Additionally, the unique molecular recruitment capabilities of condensates inspire innovative advancements in biomaterial design for applications in drug discovery, delivery, and biosynthesis. This work highlights recent progress in understanding the mechanisms underlying protein phase behavior, particularly how it responds to internal molecular changes and external physical stimuli. Furthermore, the fabrication of multifunctional materials derived from diverse protein sources through controlled phase transitions is demonstrated.

Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based fibrous aggregate materials (BFAMs) have gained increasing attention in biomedicine due to their excellent biocompatibility, processability, biodegradability, and multifunctionality. Especially, the medical applications of BFAMs demand advanced structure, performance, and function, which conventional trial&#8208;and&#8208;error methods struggle to provide. This necessitates the rational selection of materials and manufacturing methods to design BFAMs with various intended functions and structures. This review summarizes the current progress in raw material selection, structural and functional design, processing technology, and application of BFAMs. Additionally, the challenges encountered during the development of BFAMs are discussed, along with perspectives for future research offered.

&lt;p&gt;Biopolymer-based fibrous aggregate materials (BFAMs) have gained increasing attention in biomedicine due to their excellent biocompatibility, processability, biodegradability, and multifunctionality. Especially, the medical applications of BFAMs demand advanced structure, performance, and function, which conventional trial-and-error methods struggle to provide. This necessitates the rational selection of materials and manufacturing methods to design BFAMs with various intended functions and structures. This review summarizes the current progress in raw material selection, structural and functional design, processing technology, and application of BFAMs. Additionally, the challenges encountered during the development of BFAMs are discussed, along with perspectives for future research offered.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Artificial Intelligence and Multiscale Modeling for Sustainable Biopolymers and Bioinspired Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores the multiscale architectures and functional mechanisms of biopolymers and bioinspired materials, from hierarchical structures to AI&#8208;powered methodologies. It covers sustainable configurations, multiscale modeling techniques, and AI applications for enhancing functionality, biodegradability, and design. The work concludes with a forward&#8208;looking perspective on biopolymer advancements and potential for broad lifecycle impacts in advanced material manufacturing.








Abstract
Biopolymers and bioinspired materials contribute to the construction of intricate hierarchical structures that exhibit advanced properties. The remarkable toughness and damage tolerance of such multilevel materials are conferred through the hierarchical assembly of their multiscale (i.e., atomistic to macroscale) components and architectures. Here, the functionality and mechanisms of biopolymers and bio&#8208;inspired materials at multilength scales are explored and summarized, focusing on biopolymer nanofibril configurations, biocompatible synthetic biopolymers, and bio&#8208;inspired composites. Their modeling methods with theoretical basis at multiple lengths and time scales are reviewed for biopolymer applications. Additionally, the exploration of artificial intelligence&#8208;powered methodologies is emphasized to realize improvements in these biopolymers from functionality, biodegradability, and sustainability to their characterization, fabrication process, and superior designs. Ultimately, a promising future for these versatile materials in the manufacturing of advanced materials across wider applications and greater lifecycle impacts is foreseen.

         <title>Autonomous Bioelectronic Devices Based on Silk Fibroin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the unique autonomous features of silk fibroin (SF), including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and biodegradability, which enable its integration into bioelectronics. Key applications such as smart textiles, epidermal sensors, and adaptable implants are explored. The discussion addresses challenges in scalability, reproducibility, and bio&#8208;integration while presenting future directions for sustainable and multifunctional silk&#8208;based technologies.








Abstract
The development of autonomous bioelectronic devices capable of dynamically adapting to changing biological environments represents a significant advancement in healthcare and wearable technologies. Such systems draw inspiration from the precision, adaptability, and self&#8208;regulation of biological processes, requiring materials with intrinsic versatility and seamless bio&#8208;integration to ensure biocompatibility and functionality over time. Silk fibroin (SF) derived from Bombyx mori cocoons, has emerged as an ideal biomaterial with a unique combination of biocompatibility, mechanical flexibility, and tunable biodegradability. Adding autonomous features into SF, including self&#8208;healing, shape&#8208;morphing, and controllable degradation, enables dynamic interactions with living tissues while minimizing immune responses and mechanical mismatches. Additionally, structural tunability and environmental sustainability of SF further reinforce its potential as a platform for adaptive implants, epidermal electronics, and intelligent textiles. This review explores recent progress in understanding the structure&#8211;property relationships of SF, its modification strategies, and its great potential for integration into advanced autonomous bioelectronic systems while addressing challenges related to scalability, reproducibility, and multifunctionality. Future opportunities, such as AI&#8208;assisted material design, scalable fabrication techniques, and the incorporation of wireless and personalized technologies, are also discussed, positioning SF as a key material in bridging the gap between biological systems and artificial technologies.

         <title>Designing for Degradation: Transient Devices Enabled by (Nano)Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent progress in transient devices enabled by (nano)cellulosic materials is reviewed. Transiency mechanisms, advantages of nanocelluloses, and a suite of applications are discussed. A circular thinking approach coupled with life cycle assessment is applied to critically revisit the potential, advantages, and challenges of nanocellulose&#8208;enabled transient devices for future materials innovation.








Abstract
Transient technology involves materials and devices that undergo controlled degradation after a reliable operation period. This groundbreaking strategy offers significant advantages over conventional devices based on non&#8208;renewable materials by limiting environmental exposure to potentially hazardous components after disposal, and by increasing material circularity. As the most abundant naturally occurring polymer on Earth, cellulose is an attractive material for this purpose. Besides, (nano)celluloses are inherently biodegradable and have competitive mechanical, optical, thermal, and ionic conductivity properties that can be exploited to develop sustainable devices and avoid the end&#8208;of&#8208;life issues associated with conventional systems. Despite its potential, few efforts have been made to review current advances in cellulose&#8208;based transient technology. Therefore, this review catalogs the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art developments in transient devices enabled by cellulosic materials. To provide a wide perspective, the various degradation mechanisms involved in cellulosic transient devices are introduced. The advanced capabilities of transient cellulosic systems in sensing, photonics, energy storage, electronics, and biomedicine are also highlighted. Current bottlenecks toward successful implementation are discussed, with material circularity and environmental impact metrics at the center. It is believed that this review will serve as a valuable resource for the proliferation of cellulose&#8208;based transient technology and its implementation into fully integrated, circular, and environmentally sustainable devices.

Abstract
Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) play a crucial role in attaining sustainable energy for various wearable devices. Polymer materials are essential components of TENGs. Biopolymers are suitable materials for TENGs because of their degradability, natural sourcing, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. Herein, the latest progress in commonly used biopolymers and well&#8208;designed biomimetic techniques for TENG is summarized. The applications of natural rubber, polysaccharides, protein&#8208;based biopolymers, and other common synthetic biopolymers in TENG technology are summarized in detail. Each biopolymer is discussed based on its electrification capability, polarity variations, and specific functionalities as active and functional layers of TENGs. Important biomimetic strategies and related applications of specific biopolymers are also summarized to guide the structural and functional design of TENG. In the future, the study of triboelectric biopolymers may focus on exploring alternative candidates, enhancing charge density, and expanding functionality. Various possible applications of biopolymer&#8208;based TENGs are proposed in this review. By applying biopolymers and related biomimetic methods to TENG devices, the applications of TENG in the fields of healthcare, environmental monitoring, and wearable/implantable electronics can be further promoted.

Abstract
Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front&#8208;runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art examples of high&#8208;performance PLA&#8208;based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo&#8208;regular sequences of PLA, poly(L&#8208;lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting&#8208;edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA&#8208;based sustainable materials.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poly(lactic acid) (PLA) is a representative biobased and biodegradable aliphatic polyester and a front-runner among sustainable materials. As a semicrystalline thermoplastic, PLA exhibits excellent mechanical and physical properties, attracting considerable attention in commodity and medical fields. Stereochemistry is a key factor affecting PLA's properties, and to this end, the engineering of PLA's microstructure for tailored material properties has been an active area of research over the decade. This Review first covers the basic structural variety of PLA. A perspective on the current states of stereocontrolled synthesis as well as the relationships between the structures and properties of PLA stereosequences are included, with an emphasis on record regularity and properties. At last, state-of-the-art examples of high-performance PLA-based materials within an array of applications are given, including packaging, fibers, and textiles, healthcare and electronic devices. Among various stereo-regular sequences of PLA, poly(L-lactic acid) (PLLA) is the most prominent category and has myriad unique properties and applications. In this regard, cutting-edge applications of PLLA are mainly overviewed in this review. At the same time, new materials developed based on other PLA stereosequences are highlighted, which holds the potential to a wide variety of PLA-based sustainable materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Balancing high performance and environmental sustainability in advanced material innovation is a challenging task. Addressing the global challenges of sustainable development and carbon neutrality lead to increased&#160;interest in biopolymer research. Nanocellulose materials, derived from biopolymers, demonstrate potential as template candidates for advanced materials, due to their unique properties, including high strength, high surface area, controllable pore structures and high&#8208;water retention.

         <dc:description>
This review systematically examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It covers key biopolymer types, structures, and properties, and explores their applications as artificial SEIs, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes. The review highlights how these biopolymers enhance electrochemical performance and discusses current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) and zinc (Zn) metals are emerging as promising anode materials for next&#8208;generation rechargeable metal batteries due to their excellent electronic conductivity and high theoretical capacities. However, issues such as uneven metal ion deposition and uncontrolled dendrite growth result in poor electrochemical stability, limited cycle life, and rapid capacity decay. Biopolymers, recognized for their abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, biodegradability, tunable structures, and adjustable properties, offer a compelling solution to these challenges. This review systematically and comprehensively examines biopolymers and their protective mechanisms for Li and Zn metal anodes. It begins with an overview of biopolymers, detailing key types, their structures, and properties. The review then explores recent advancements in the application of biopolymers as artificial solid electrolyte interphases, electrolyte additives, separators, and solid&#8208;state electrolytes, emphasizing how their structural properties enhance protection mechanisms and improve electrochemical performance. Finally, perspectives on current challenges and future research directions in this evolving field are provided.

Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF&#8208;based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.








Abstract
Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF&#8208;based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF&#8208;based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF&#8208;based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in&#8208;depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF&#8208;based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF&#8208;based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.

&lt;p&gt;Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) has unique intrinsic physical properties, showing great potential for constructing sustainable materials. This review introduces emerging CNF-based structural materials, including challenges in their assembly process and their exceptional mechanical and thermal properties. Based on the structural designability and functionalization characteristics of CNF-based structural materials, the potential applications and future trends are discussed.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Under the guidance of the carbon peaking and carbon neutrality goals, the urgency for green ecological construction and the depletion of nonrenewable resources highlight the importance of the research and development of sustainable new materials. Cellulose nanofiber (CNF) is the most abundant natural nanoscale building block widely existing on Earth. CNF has unique intrinsic physical properties, such as low density, low coefficient of thermal expansion, high strength, and high modulus, which is an ideal candidate with outstanding potential for constructing sustainable materials. In recent years, CNF-based structural material has emerged as a sustainable lightweight material with properties very different from traditional structural materials. Here, to comprehensively introduce the assembly of structural materials based on CNF, it starts with an overview of different forms of CNF-based materials, including fibers, films, hydrogels, aerogels, and structural materials. Next, the challenges that need to be overcome in preparing CNF-based structural materials are discussed, their assembly methods are introduced, and an in-depth analysis of the advantages of the CNF-based hydrogel assembly strategy to fabricate structural materials is conducted. Finally, the unique properties of emerging CNF-based structural materials are summarized and concluded with an outlook on their design and functionalization, potentially paving the way toward new opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wearable electronics utilizing advanced carbon materials from fossil origins face issues like non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers present a sustainable alternative for carbon&#8208;based wearables. This review highlights the carbonization of key biopolymers&#8212;cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin&#8212;discussing mechanisms, techniques, and applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials in wearable technology.








Abstract
Advanced carbon materials are widely utilized in wearable electronics. Nevertheless, the production of carbon materials from fossil&#8208;based sources raised concerns regarding their non&#8208;renewability, high energy consumption, and the consequent greenhouse gas emissions. Biopolymers, readily available in nature, offer a promising and eco&#8208;friendly alternative as a carbon source, enabling the sustainable production of carbon materials for wearable electronics. This review aims to discuss the carbonization mechanisms, carbonization techniques, and processes, as well as the diverse applications of biopolymer&#8208;derived carbon materials (BioCMs) in wearable electronics. First, the characteristics of four representative biopolymers, including cellulose, lignin, chitin, and silk fibroin, and their carbonization processes are discussed. Then, typical carbonization techniques, including pyrolysis carbonization, laser&#8208;induced carbonization, Joule heating carbonization, hydrothermal transformation, and salt encapsulation carbonization are discussed. The influence of the processes on the morphology and properties of the resultant BioCMs are summarized. Subsequently, applications of BioCMs in wearable devices, including physical sensors, chemical sensors, energy devices, and display devices are discussed. Finally, the challenges currently facing the field and the future opportunities are discussed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review presents recent advancements in producing sustainable flame&#8208;retardant materials using biopolymers as additive agents, functional coatings, and structural matrices. The focus is on advanced applications for lithium&#8208;ion batteries, thermal insulation, and fire warning devices. Most of these applications utilize biopolymers derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, lignin, chitosan, and alginates obtained from plants and marine organisms.








Abstract
Polymeric materials featuring excellent flame retardancy are essential for applications requiring high levels of fire safety, while those based on biopolymers are highly favored due to their eco&#8208;friendly nature, sustainable characteristics, and abundant availability. This review first outlines the pyrolysis behaviors of biopolymers, with particular emphasis on naturally occurring ones derived from non&#8208;food sources such as cellulose, chitin/chitosan, alginate, and lignin. Then, the strategies for chemical modifications of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes through covalent, ionic, and coordination bonds are presented and compared. The emphasis is placed on advanced methods for introducing biopolymer&#8208;based flame retardants into polymeric matrices and fabricating biopolymer&#8208;based flame&#8208;retardant materials. Finally, the challenges for sustaining the current momentum in the utilization of biopolymers for flame&#8208;retardant purposes are further discussed.

         <title>Hierarchical Engineering for Biopolymer&#8208;based Hydrogels with Tailored Property and Functionality</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, key strategies for designing biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels from the molecular to the macroscopic scale are summarized. Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>An Implantable and Degradable Silk Sericin Protein Film Energy Harvester for Next&#8208;Generation Cardiovascular Electronic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A piezoelectric film is created using structural engineered silk sericin, presenting satisfactory output performance, biocompatibility, and biodegradability. This piezoelectric film&#8208;based energy&#8208;harvester can illuminate LED or operate a portable electronic device through converting mechanical energy into electrical energy. It holds promise as a power source for delivering effective electrical stimulation to restore cardiac activity in asystole or normalize an AV block.








Abstract
Current cardiovascular implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) face a pressing clinical need for the development of battery&#8208;free, biodegradable, and biocompatible devices to mitigate the risk of adverse in vivo responses. To address this demand, it is proposed utilizing a natural biomaterial, silk sericin (SS), which exhibits valuable biological activities and contains abundant asymmetric amino acids with adjustable structures, to create an implantable self&#8208;powered system based on the piezoelectric principle. The functionalized SS&#8208;based (F&#8208;SS&#8208;based) piezoelectric film demonstrates a high longitudinal piezoelectric tensor (d33) of 12&#160;pC&#160;N&#8722;1. An energy&#8208;generating device (EG device) utilizing this piezoelectric film can generate electric energy under mechanical force both in vitro and in vivo. By manually tapping the EG&#8208;device for a few minutes, the accumulated electricity in a commercial capacitor (1.1&#160;&#181;F) could illuminate LEDs or operate a timer. Furthermore, the instantaneous energy power density (218.5&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2) achieved by manual pressing the EG device is sufficient to deliver effective pacing to restart a non&#8208;beating heart or normalize an atrioventricular block in a preclinical model. Owing to its high biocompatibility and biodegradability in physiological environments, the F&#8208;SS&#8208;based EG device holds significant promise for the advancement of self&#8208;powered power systems for next&#8208;generation CIEDs and other implantable and degradable electronic devices.

         <title>Biopolymeric Ionotronics Based on Biodegradable Wool Keratin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The pH&#8208;responsive wool keratin serves as the sole biopolymer matrix for the fabrication of high&#8208;performance ionotronic devices, without the use of toxic chemicals, complex synthesis, or grafting processes. Furthermore, the innate biodegradability of wool keratin makes it an environmentally friendly option, furthering the advancement of sustainable devices based on natural polymers.








Abstract
The advent of ionotronics has revealed significant potential in flexible transistors, energy harvesting, and unconventional circuits. However, most ionotronic devices, often centered around synthetic polymers, involve complex grafting or synthesis that raise legitimate concerns about their environmental sustainability. Herein, a simple yet versatile approach for developing single&#8208;composition ionotronic devices using wool keratin (WK), a biodegradable and pH&#8208;responsive natural polymer is presented. By employing facile pH regulation processes, WK molecules with opposing polarities are successfully modified, which are combined to form an ionic heterojunction through entropically driven depletion. This ionic heterojunction functions as an ionic diode, enabling efficient rectification of alternating current signals (with a rectification ratio of up to 199). Furthermore, the application of this biopolymeric ionotronic device is extended to mechanical energy harvesting, self&#8208;powered sensing, and ionic logic circuit. The biodegradability and renewability of WK offer a viable alternative to synthetic materials, highlighting its potential for sustainable applications.

         <title>Expanded Nanofibrous Cellulose Electrode Binder: Declustering Lithium Polysulfides for Lean&#8208;Electrolyte Li&#8210;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2,2,6,6&#8208;Tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as a class of expanded nanofibrous electrode binders for lean&#8208;electrolyte lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries. Owing to the increased active sites for intermolecular interaction with Li polysulfides (LiPS), the TOCN binder promotes the declustering of LiPS, thereby achieving a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503 Wh kg&#8722;1 at a low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0 &#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1.








Abstract
Despite their potential as an alternative to commercial lithium (Li)&#8210;ion batteries, Li&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries face challenges related to energy density limitations caused by the considerable amount of electrolyte required. Lean electrolytes have proven effective in mitigating this issue. However, they tend to exacerbate Li polysulfides (LiPS) clustering, resulting in incomplete S utilization and sluggish conversion kinetics. Here, 2,2,6,6&#8208;tetramethylpiperidin&#8208;1&#8208;oxyl radical (TEMPO)&#8208;oxidized cellulose nanofiber (TOCN) is presented as an expanded nanofibrous electrode binder for lean&#8208;electrolyte Li&#8210;S batteries. Owing to its 1D fibrous structure and expanded inter&#8208;glucose chain distance, the TOCN binder offers more accessible active sites for intermolecular interactions with LiPS. Consequently, LiPS cluster formation is effectively suppressed even at a low TOCN binder content of 1 wt%, while a high S loading of 72 wt% is achieved. The resulting S cathode with the TOCN binder enables Li&#8210;S cells to exhibit a remarkable specific capacity of 1221 mAh gsulfur&#8722;1 under constrained electrolyte conditions (low electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;sulfur ratio of 2.0&#160;&#181;L mgsulfur&#8722;1 and low density of 0.927&#160;g mL&#8722;1), yielding a high cell&#8208;level energy density of 503&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 that surpasses those of previously reported S cathodes based on conventional synthetic polymer binders.

         <title>The Structure&#8208;Mechanics Relationship of Bamboo&#8208;Epidermis and Inspired Composite Design by Artificial Intelligence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article investigates the micromechanics of bamboo epidermis, focusing on how anisotropic silica particle distributions enhance toughness. By integrating experimental imaging, 3D printing, and generative AI, the study develops bio&#8208;inspired particle&#8208;reinforced composites with mechanical properties akin to bamboo. The findings expand design possibilities for composites, offering innovative solutions for applications demanding high toughness and mechanical reliability.








Abstract
Bamboo culm has been widely used in engineering for its high strength, lightweight, and low cost. Its outermost epidermis is a smooth and dense layer that contains cellulose, silica particles, and stomata and acts as a water and mechanical barrier. Recent experimental studies have shown that the layer has a higher mechanical strength than other inside regions. Still, the mechanism is unclear, especially for how the low silica concentration (&lt;10%) can effectively reinforce the layer and prevent the inner fibers from splitting. Here, theoretical analysis is combined with experimental imaging and 3D printing to investigate the effect of the distribution of silica particles on composite mechanics. The anisotropic partial distribution function of silica particles in bamboo skin yields higher toughness (&gt;10%) than randomly distributed particles. A generative artificial intelligence (AI) model inspired by bamboo epidermis is developed to generate particle&#8208;reinforced composites. Besides the visual similarity, it is found that the samples by the generative model show failure processes and fracture toughness identical to the actual bamboo epidermis. This work reveals the micromechanics of the bamboo epidermis. It illustrates that generative AI can help design bio&#8208;inspired composites of a complex structure that cannot be uniformly represented by a simple building block or optimized around local boundaries. It expands the design space of particle&#8208;reinforced composites for enhanced toughness modulus, offering advantages in industries where mechanical reliability is critical.

         <title>Moisture&#8208;Dependent Vibrational Dynamics and Phonon Transport in Nanocellulose Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Uptake of water in cellulose play an important role in modulating the structure and phonon transport. This study reports how moisture&#8208;dependent structural modification relates to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of nanocellulose using inelastic neutron scattering and wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering. Phonon transport is controlled by the moisture&#8208;induced increase of the coherence length and swelling of the foam walls.








Abstract
Superinsulating nanofibrillar cellulose foams have the potential to replace fossil&#8208;based insulating materials, but the development is hampered by the moisture&#8208;dependent heat transport and the lack of direct measurements of phonon transport. Here, inelastic neutron scattering is used together with wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering (WAXS) and small angle neutron scattering to relate the moisture&#8208;dependent structural modifications to the vibrational dynamics and phonon transport and scattering of cellulose nanofibrils from wood and tunicate, and wood cellulose nanocrystals (W&#8208;CNC). The moisture interacted primarily with the disordered regions in nanocellulose, and WAXS showed that the crystallinity and coherence length increased as the moisture content increased. The phonon population derived from directional&#8208;dependent phonon density of states (GDOS) increased along the cellulose chains in W&#8208;CNC between 5 and 8 wt% D2O, while the phonon population perpendicular to the chains remained&#160;relatively unaffected, suggesting that the effect of increased crystallinity and coherence length on phonon transport is compensated by the moisture&#8208;induced swelling of the foam walls. Frequency scaling in the low&#8208;energy GDOS showed that materials based on hygroscopic and semicrystalline nanocellulose falls in between the predicted behavior for solids and liquids. Phonon&#8208;engineering of hygroscopic biopolymer&#8208;based insulation materials is promoted by the insights on the moisture&#8208;dependent phonon&#160;transport.

         <title>Biomimetic Intrafibrillar Mineralization of Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;Like Fibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Hierarchically Structured Amyloid&#8208;like Fibrils (HSAF), prepared through a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation of a protein nanofilm, exhibit an ordered, dynamic layered structure with adaptive gaps that facilitate intrafibrillar mineralization. The mineralized HSAF mimics biological hard tissues with ordered protein&#8208;hydroxyapatite organization, and demonstrates exceptional bioactivity in promoting native bone growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization.









Abstract
Intrafibrillar mineralization is essential not only as a fundamental process in forming biological hard tissues but also as a foundation for developing advanced composite fibril&#8208;based materials for innovative applications. Traditionally, only natural collagen fibrils have been shown to enable intrafibrillar mineralization, presenting a challenge in designing ordered hierarchical fibrils from common protein aggregation that exhibit similar high intrafibrillar mineralization activity. In this study, a mechanically directed two&#8208;step transformation method is developed that converts phase&#8208;transitioned protein nanofilms into crystalline, hierarchical amyloid&#8208;like fibrils with multilayer structures, which effectively control the growth and lateral organization of hydroxyapatite within adaptive gaps. The resulting mineralized HSAF achieves a hardness of 0.616 &#177;&#160;0.007&#160;GPa and a modulus of 19.06 &#177;&#160;3.54 GPa&#8212;properties closely resembling native hard tissues&#8212;and exhibits exceptionally high bioactivity in promoting both native bone tissue growth and further intrafibrillar mineralization, achieving 76.9% repair in a mice cranial defect model after 8 weeks and outperforming other regenerative materials. This remarkable performance, stemming from the unique structure and composition of the fibers, positions HSAF as a promising candidate for biomedical and engineering applications. These findings advance the understanding of biomineralization mechanisms and establish a foundation for developing high&#8208;bioactivity materials for hard tissue regeneration.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

A generalizable molecular engineering methodology is developed to transform diverse biomass feedstocks, such as cellulose, starch, and chitosan, into efficient hydrogel sorbents for atmospheric water harvesting (AWH). Outdoor tests reveal a water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8315;&#185; day&#8315;&#185;, demonstrating significant potential for sustainable water solutions. This approach advances scalable AWH technologies by leveraging abundant, environmentally friendly resources.








Abstract
Atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) offers a promising pathway to alleviate global water scarcity, highlighting the need for environmentally responsible sorbent materials. In this context, this research introduces a universal strategy for transforming natural polysaccharides into effective hydrogel sorbents, demonstrated with cellulose, starch, and chitosan. The methodology unites alkylation to graft thermoresponsive groups, thereby enhancing water processability and enabling energy&#8208;efficient water release at lower temperatures, with the integration of zwitterionic groups to ensure stable and effective water sorption. The molecularly functionalized cellulose hydrogel, exemplifying our approach, shows favorable water uptake of 0.86&#8211;1.32&#160;g g&#8722;1 at 15&#8211;30% relative humidity (RH), along with efficient desorption, releasing 95% of captured water at 60 &#176;C. Outdoor tests highlight the water production rate of up to 14.19&#160;kg kg&#8722;1 day&#8722;1 by electrical heating. The proposed molecular engineering methodology, which expands the range of raw materials by leveraging abundant biomass feedstock, has the potential to advance sorbent production and scalable AWH technologies, contributing to sustainable solutions.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk fibroin ionic touchscreen platform with high elasticity, high environmental tolerance, and biodegradability, is introduced for sustainable flexible electronics. This study showcases the platform's environmental stability, reusability, and advanced applications in IoT and AI&#8208;enhanced interfaces, such as real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and virtual reality, paving the way for greener next&#8208;generation devices.








Abstract
The increasing prevalence of electronic devices has led to a significant rise in electronic waste (e&#8208;waste), necessitating the development of sustainable materials for flexible electronics. In this study, silk fibroin ionic touch screen (SFITS) is introduced, a new platform integrating natural silk fibroin (SF) with ionic conductors to create highly elastic, environmentally stable, and multifunctional touch interfaces. Through a humidity&#8208;induced crystallization strategy, the molecular structure of SF is precisely controlled to achieve a balanced combination of mechanical strength, electrical conductivity, and biodegradability. The assembly and operational reliability of SFITS are demonstrated under various environmental conditions, along with their reusability through green recycling methods. Additionally, the intelligent design and application of SFITS are explored by incorporating Internet of Things (IoT) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. This integration enables real&#8208;time touch sensing, handwriting recognition, and advanced human&#8208;computer interactions. The versatility of SFITS is further exemplified through applications in remote control systems, molecular model generation, and virtual reality interfaces. The findings highlight the potential of sustainable ionic conductors in next&#8208;generation flexible electronics, offering a path toward greener and more intelligent device designs.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Shearing Chemistry Directed Closed&#8208;Pore Regeneration in Biomass&#8208;Derived Hard Carbons for Ultrafast Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces an innovative DES cell&#8208;shearing strategy to tailor the closed&#8208;pore structure in bamboo&#8208;derived hard carbons. The optimized structure with appropriate closed&#8208;pore size (&#8764;2nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) walls exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. This work significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.








Abstract
The closed&#8208;pore structure of hard carbons holds the key to high plateau capacity and rapid diffusion kinetics when applied as sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) anodes. However, understanding and establishing the structure&#8208;electrochemistry relationship still remains a significant challenge. This work, for the first time, introduces an innovative deep eutectic solvent (DES) cell&#8208;shearing strategy to precisely tailor the cell structure of natural bamboo and consequently the closed&#8208;pore in its derived hard carbons. The DES shearing force effectively modifies the pore architecture by simultaneously shearing and dissolving amorphous components to form closed pore cores with adjustable sizes, as well as disintegrating crystalline cellulose through generation of competing hydrogen bonds to elaborately tune the pore wall thickness and ordering. The optimized closed&#8208;pore structure featuring appropriate pore size (&#8764;2 nm) and ultra&#8208;thin (1&#8211;3 layers) disordered pore walls, exhibits abundant active sites and delivers rapid ion diffusion kinetics and high reaction reversibility. Consequently, a high reversible capacity of 422 mAh g&#8722;1 at 30 mA g&#8722;1 along with an exceptional rate capability (318.6 mAh g&#8722;1 at 6 A g&#8722;1) are achieved, outperforming almost all previous reported hard carbons. The new concept of cell&#8208;shearing chemistry for closed&#8208;pore regeneration significantly advances the applications of biomass materials for energy storage.

         <title>Self&#8208;Reinforcing Ionogel Bioadhesive Interface for Robust Integration and Monitoring of Bioelectronic Devices with Hard Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A silk&#8208;based self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel shows good adhesion performance on biological hard tissues, common bioelectrode materials, and hard biomaterials. It can be assembled with the gold resonant circuit to form a wireless sensor to monitor the wound&#8208;healing process of biological hard tissues.








Abstract
Integrating bioelectronic devices with hard tissues, such as bones and teeth, is essential for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic technologies. However, stable and durable adhesion in dynamic, moist environments remains challenging. Traditional bioadhesives often fail to maintain strong bonds, especially when interfacing with metal electrodes and hard tissues. This study introduces a self&#8208;reinforcing ionogel bioadhesive interface (IGBI) combining silk fibroin and calcium ions, designed to provide robust and conductive integration of bioelectronic devices with hard tissues. The IGBI exhibits strong adhesion (up to 186&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) and undergoes mechanical self&#8208;reinforcement through a structural transition in silk fibroin under physiological conditions. In vivo experiments demonstrate the IGBI's effectiveness in repairing bone defects and reimplanting teeth, with the added capability of wireless, real&#8208;time monitoring of bone healing. This approach allows for continuous tracking of tissue regeneration without a second invasive surgery for device removal. The IGBI represents a significant advancement in bioelectronic integration, offering a durable and versatile solution for challenging environments. Such unique self&#8208;reinforcing properties make the IGBI a promising material for biomedical applications where traditional adhesives are insufficient.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanochitin&#8208;Based Porous Constructs for Light&#8208;Driven Whole&#8208;Cell Biotransformations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biomimetically cross&#8208;linked nanochitin cryogels are used for immobilization matrix for a solid&#8208;state cell factory. The resulting cryogels with hierarchical porosity manage to overcome the conventional limitations of mass transfer and light transmittance, as demonstrated by a number of light&#8208;driven biotransformation reactions.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories (SSPCFs) are a new production concept that leverages the innate photosynthetic abilities of microbes to drive the production of valuable chemicals. It addresses practical challenges such as high energy and water demand and improper light distribution associated with suspension&#8208;based culturing; however, these systems often face significant challenges related to mass transfer. The approach focuses on overcoming these limitations by carefully engineering the microstructure of the immobilization matrix through freeze&#8208;induced assembly of nanochitin building blocks. The use of nanochitins with optimized size distribution enabled the formation of macropores with lamellar spatial organization, which significantly improves light transmittance and distribution, crucial for maximizing the efficiency of photosynthetic reactions. The biomimetic crosslinking strategy, leveraging specific interactions between polyphosphate anions and primary amine groups featured on chitin fibers, produced mechanically robust and wet&#8208;resilient cryogels that maintained their functionality under operational conditions. Various model biotransformation reactions leading to value&#8208;added chemicals are performed in chitin&#8208;based matrix. It demonstrates superior or comparable performance to existing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art matrices and suspension&#8208;based systems. The findings suggest that chitin&#8208;based cryogel approach holds significant promise for advancing the development of solid&#8208;state photosynthetic cell factories, offering a scalable solution to improve the efficiency and productivity of light&#8208;driven biotransformation.

         <title>SciAgents: Automating Scientific Discovery Through Bioinspired Multi&#8208;Agent Intelligent Graph Reasoning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The SciAgents AI model drives hypothesis generation by harnessing multi&#8208;agent graph reasoning, extracting insights from knowledge graphs constructed from scientific papers. Each agent plays a specific role: the Ontologist defines concepts, the Scientists draft and refine proposals, and the Critic reviews. Together, these agents create data&#8208;driven, innovative research ideas, advancing beyond traditional, human&#8208;led approaches.








Abstract
A key challenge in artificial intelligence (AI) is the creation of systems capable of autonomously advancing scientific understanding by exploring novel domains, identifying complex patterns, and uncovering previously unseen connections in vast scientific data. In this work, SciAgents, an approach that leverages three core concepts is presented: (1) large&#8208;scale ontological knowledge graphs to organize and interconnect diverse scientific concepts, (2) a suite of large language models (LLMs) and data retrieval tools, and (3) multi&#8208;agent systems with in&#8208;situ learning capabilities. Applied to biologically inspired materials, SciAgents reveals hidden interdisciplinary relationships that were&#160;previously considered unrelated, achieving a scale, precision, and exploratory power that surpasses human research methods. The framework autonomously generates and refines research hypotheses, elucidating underlying mechanisms, design principles, and unexpected material properties. By integrating these capabilities in a modular fashion, the system yields material discoveries, critiques and improves existing hypotheses, retrieves up&#8208;to&#8208;date data about existing research, and highlights strengths and limitations. This is achieved by harnessing a &#8220;swarm of intelligence&#8221; similar to biological systems, providing new avenues for discovery. How this model accelerates the development of advanced materials by unlocking Nature's design principles, resulting in a new biocomposite with enhanced mechanical properties and improved sustainability through energy&#8208;efficient production is shown.

         <title>Sustainable Smart Packaging from Protein Nanofibrils</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart packaging can extend shelf life and improve food quality monitoring. This study introduces a novel smart packaging solution using amyloid fibrils and red radish anthocyanins to monitor seafood spoilage. These findings show that these films effectively indicate shrimp freshness and possess high antibacterial and antioxidant properties, offering a sustainable approach to food packaging.








Abstract
Smart packaging technologies are revolutionizing the food industry by extending shelf life and enhancing quality monitoring through environmental responsiveness. Here, a novel smart packaging concept is presented, based on amyloid fibrils (AM) and red radish anthocyanins (RRA), to effectively monitor food spoilage by color change. A protein nanofibrils biofilm is developed from whey protein, which is functionalized with RRA to endow the resulting films with advanced monitoring capabilities. A comprehensive characterization, including pH responsiveness, water vapor permeability, thermal and mechanical testing, and colorimetric responses, demonstrates the superiority of AM/RRA films compared to control films based on whey monomer building blocks. The findings indicate that the AM/RRA films can effectively monitor, for example, shrimp freshness, showing visible changes within one day at room temperature and significant alterations in color after two days. Furthermore, these films exhibit high antibacterial and antioxidant activities, reinforcing their suitability for efficient food packaging. By integrating bio&#8208;based materials from whey and natural anthocyanins, this research presents a biodegradable, sustainable, and cost&#8208;effective smart packaging solution, contributing to eco&#8208;friendly innovations in food preservation.

         <title>Low&#8208;Cost Hyperelastic Fuller&#8208;Dome&#8208;Structured Nanocellulose Aerogels by Dual Templates for Personal Thermal Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A low&#8208;cost mechanically ultra&#8208;resilient cellulose&#8208;based aerogel with Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;like structure is developed by a dual&#8208;template strategy. The aerogel shows a desired cost&#8208;performance combination of low density, hypereslaticity, superhydrophobicity, ultralow thermal conductivity, and low cost, making it hold great promise as a thermal retention material for personal thermal management.








Abstract
It is critically important to maintain the body's thermal comfort for human beings in extremely cold environments. Cellulose nanofibers (CNF)&#8208;based aerogels represent a promising sustainable material for body's heat retention because of their renewability and low thermal conductivity. However, CNF&#8208;based aerogels often suffer high production costs due to expensive CNF, poor elasticity and/or unsatisfactory thermal insulation owing to improper microstructure design. Here, a facile dual&#8208;template strategy is reported to prepare a low&#8208;cost, hyperelastic, superhydrophobic Fuller&#8208;dome&#8208;structured CNF aerogel (CNF@PU) with low thermal conductivity. The combination of air template by foaming process and ice template enables the formation of a dome&#8208;like microstructure of CNF@PU aerogel, in which CNF serves as rope bars while inexpensive polyurethane (PU) acts as joints. The aerogel combines ultra&#8208;elasticity, low thermal conductivity (24&#160;mW m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1), and low costs. The as&#8208;prepared CNF@PU aerogel demonstrates much better heat retention than commercial thermal retention fillers (e.g., Flannelette and goose down), promising its great commercial potential for massively producing warming garments. This work provides a facile approach for creating high&#8208;performance aerogels with tailored microstructure for effective personal thermal management.

         <title>Spray&#8208;Assisted Fabrication of Cellulose Photonic Pigments on Superhydrophobic Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to directly produce structurally colored microparticles by drying cholesteric cellulose nanocrystal microdroplets on a superhydrophobic surface is reported. This approach has several key advantages that can unlock large&#8208;scale fabrication of sustainable photonic pigments, including exploiting existing industrial techniques (e.g. aerosolization), reduction in chemicals required (e.g. surfactants), rapid production times (&#8776;40 min or less), and size&#8208;independent and robust color.









Abstract
Photonic pigments, especially those based on naturally&#8208;derived building blocks like cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), are emerging as a promising sustainable alternative to absorption&#8208;based colorants. However, the proposed manufacturing methods for CNC pigments, via either grinding films or emulsion&#8208;based production, usually require several processing steps. This limits their commercialization by increasing the costs, timescales, and environmental impacts of production. Toward addressing these challenges, it is reported that photonic pigments can be produced in a single process by drying microdroplets of aqueous CNC suspension on a superhydrophobic surface. Such liquid&#8208;repellent substrate ensures the microdroplets maintain a near&#8208;spherical shape, enabling the radial self&#8208;organization of the cholesteric phase. Upon drying under ambient conditions, the CNC mesophase becomes kinetically arrested, after which the strong capillary forces induced by water evaporation result in extensive buckling of the microparticle. This buckling, coupled with prior tuning of the CNC formulation, enables photonic pigments with adjustable color across the visible spectrum. Importantly, the elimination of an emulsifying oil phase to create microdroplets enables a much faster drying time (&#8776;40 min) and improved color stability (e.g., polar solvents, elevated temperatures), while the reduction in reagents (e.g., oils, surfactants) and post&#8208;processing steps (e.g., solvent, heat) improves the sustainability of the fabrication process.

Triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) represent a promising technology for energy harvesting and self&#8208;powered sensing with a wide range of applications. Despite their potential, challenges such as the need for cost&#8208;effective, large&#8208;area electrodes and engineering sustainable triboelectric materials remain, especially given the impending restrictions on single&#8208;use engineering plastics in Europe. To address these challenges, engineering nano&#8208;graphite&#8208;coated paper is presented as a sustainable and high&#8208;performance alternative for triboelectric layers. Moreover, this material, which can be produced on an industrial scale, offers a viable replacement for metal electrodes. The combination of nano&#8208;graphite and paper, with its large contact area and inherent surface roughness, enables ultra&#8208;high power densities exceeding 14 kW&#160;m&#8722;2, driven by electrostatic discharge at the surface. Beyond energy harvesting, smart sensors are developed for floors and walls that detect movements for security purposes and smart sheets that monitor body movements and physiological activities during sleep. The findings highlight the potential of this engineering paper to serve as an eco&#8208;friendly alternative to engineering plastics in TENGs and electrodes, opening new avenues for future applications.

         <title>Environmental Sustainability of Natural Biopolymer&#8208;Based Electrolytes for Lithium Ion Battery Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twenty&#8208;one biopolymer electrolytes including membrane&#8208;liquid electrolytes, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are synthesized to analyze their electrochemical properties and environmental impacts through life cycle assessment. This consistent and comparable study demonstrates the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes for batteries, guiding academia and industry in fundamental studies and applied implementation of sustainable bio&#8208;based polymers and biopolymer electrolytes.








Abstract
Biopolymer based electrolytes can overcome current performance limitations of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs). Biopolymers enable electrolytes with high ionic conductivities and wide electrochemical stability windows. While the biobased character of natural materials is claimed as an inherent advantage in meeting current environmental sustainability challenges, further research is required to quantify and compare their environmental impacts as electrolytes. The challenge is addressed by identifying the most promising biopolymer electrolytes for LIBs, measuring ionic conductivities and electrochemical stability windows, and quantifying environmental impacts using life cycle assessment. The environmental impacts of the cost to isolate cellulose derivatives, nanocelluloses, chitin/nanochitin, chitosan, lignin, agar, and silk are reported for climate change, acidification, freshwater ecotoxicity, marine eutrophication, human toxicity, and water use. Material criticality, circularity index, and material circularity indicator, emerging impact categories are prioritized to help integrate biopolymers into circular and sustainable materials. The electrochemical properties and environmental impacts of natural biopolymer membrane&#8208;liquid electrolyte pairs, gel electrolytes, and solid electrolytes are quantified and benchmarked against conventional fossil&#8208;based electrolytes, providing consistent and comparable electrochemical properties of the most relevant biopolymer electrolytes fabricated so far. This study highlights the significant functional and environmental benefits of biopolymer electrolytes and identifies the most electrochemically competitive biopolymer electrolytes in LIBs.

         <title>Nanocellulose&#8208;Derived Hierarchical Carbon Framework&#8208;Supported P&#8208;Doped MoO2 Nanoparticles for Optimizing Redox Kinetics in Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <title>A Bio&#8208;Inspired Perspective on Materials Sustainability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 22, June 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective discusses natural materials as inspiration for sustainable engineering designs and the processing of materials. First, circularity, longevity, parsimony, and activity are presented as essential material paradigms. The perspective then uses many examples of natural and technical materials to introduce principles such as oligo&#8208;materiality, multifunctionality, modularity, defect tolerance, remodeling, healing, adaptivity, as well as controlled disintegration.








Abstract
The article explores materials sustainability through a bio&#8208;inspired lens and discusses paradigms that can reshape the understanding of material synthesis, processing, and usage. It addresses various technological fields, from structural engineering to healthcare, and emphasizes natural material cycles as a blueprint for efficient recycling and reuse. The study shows that material functionality depends on both chemical composition and structural modifications, which emphasizes the role of material processing. The article identifies strategies such as mono&#8208;materiality and multifunctionality, and explores how responsivity, adaptivity, modularity, and cellularity can simplify material assembly and disassembly. Bioinspired strategies for reusing materials, defect tolerance, maintenance, remodeling, and healing may extend product lifespans. The principles of circularity, longevity, and parsimony are reconsidered in the context of &#8220;active materiality&#8221;, a dynamic bio&#8208;inspired paradigm. This concept expands the traditional focus of material science from structure&#8208;function relationships to include the development of materials capable of responding or adapting to external stimuli. Concrete examples demonstrate how bio&#8208;inspired strategies are being applied in engineering and technology to enhance the sustainability of materials. The article concludes by emphasizing interdisciplinary collaboration as a key factor for developing a sustainable and resilient materials economy in harmony with nature's material cycles.

Wood and cellulose are the most abundant and important sustainable materials on the planet at the disposal to solve major societal challenges. This perspective, written for all materials scientists, highlights how breakthroughs in cellulose nanotechnology combined with functional nanomaterials can revolutionize important areas like construction, electronics, recycling, and intelligent materials at scale, toward a sustainable future.








Abstract
Wood, with its constituent building block cellulose, is by far the most common biomaterial on the planet and has been the most important material used by humans to establish civilization. If there is one single biomaterial that should be studied and used by materials scientists across disciplines to achieve a sustainable future, it is cellulose. This perspective provides insights for the general materials science community about the unique properties of wood and cellulose and how they may be used in advanced sustainable materials to make a substantial societal impact. The focus is on sawn wood or cellulose fibers produced at scale by industry and the more recent cellulosic nanomaterials, highlighting the areas where these cellulose&#8208;based materials can be valorized into higher&#8208;order functions. Numerous articles have comprehensively reviewed different areas where cellulose is currently used in advanced materials science. The objective here is to provide general insight for all material scientists and to provide the opinions about the areas in which cellulose and wood have the largest potential to make a significant societal impact, especially to realize next&#8208;generation sustainable materials for construction, food, water, energy, and information. Discussing key areas where future research is needed to open avenues toward a more sustainable future is ended.
