         <title>One&#8208;Step Symbiosis of Bimetallic Peroxides Nanoparticles to Induce Ferroptosis/Cuproptosis and Activate cGAS&#8208;STING Pathway for Enhanced Tumor Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The designed zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides nanoparticles, which are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of metal acetates, can release Zn2+, Cu2+, and H2O2 in TME to induce ferroptosis/cuproptosis and activate cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Therefore, anti&#8208;tumor adaptive and innate immunotherapy can be simultaneously promoted to effectively inhibit tumor growth and metastasis with assistance of immune checkpoint inhibitor.








Abstract
To improve the efficiency and application prospects of metal peroxides in tumor therapy, the synthesis of bimetallic peroxides via simple yet effective approaches will be highly significant. In this work, hyaluronic acid modified zinc&#8208;copper bimetallic peroxides (ZCPO@HA) nanoparticles are synthesized through a one&#8208;step symbiotic method by co&#8208;hydrolysis of zinc acetate and copper acetate in weakly alkaline solution, followed by modification with sodium hyaluronate. Upon decomposition in the tumor microenvironment, ZCPO@HA nanoparticles can generate a considerable content of hydroxyl radical (&#183;OH) by Fenton&#8208;like reaction between Cu2+ and self&#8208;compensating hydrogen peroxide, while downregulating the expression of glutathione peroxidase 4 to induce ferroptosis. The abundant release of Cu2+ leads to the aggregation of dihydrolipoamide S&#8208;acetyltransferase and the reduction of iron&#8208;sulfur cluster proteins, causing cuproptosis. The immunogenic cell death of tumor cells releases abundant damage associated molecular patterns, effectively activating the adaptive immune response. Zn2+ and &#183;OH cause mitochondrial damage, leading to the release of a substantial amount of mitochondrial DNA. This subsequently activates the cyclic guanosine monophosphate&#8208;adenosine monophosphate synthase&#8208;stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS&#8208;STING) pathway, enhancing the innate immune response. In conclusion, it synthesizes a new type of bimetallic peroxides by one&#8208;step symbiosis for activating anti&#8208;tumor immunotherapy combined with immune checkpoint inhibitor.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Pyrolysis: A Universal Route to High&#8208;Loading Single&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a molten salt strategy for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts at 450&#160;&#176;C via LiCl/KCl&#8208;mediated Fe2+/Zn2+ exchange on nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon substrates. By stabilizing Fe2+ ions and suppressing the Fe&#8208;oxide nanoparticle formation&#8212;a common limitation in conventional high&#8208;temperature pyrolysis&#8212;it achieves a 3.9 wt.% Fe loading of atomically dispersed Fe&#8208;N4 sites, delivering superior H2&#8212;O2 fuel cell performance.








Abstract
High&#8208;temperature pyrolysis (HTP, &#8805;900&#160;&#176;C) is a widely used method for synthesizing single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs). However, the high operational temperatures required for HTP pose significant challenges in achieving high single&#8208;atom loading, primarily due to the Ostwald ripening effect. In this work, a low&#8208;temperature trans&#8208;metalation synthesis approach is developed which involves the exchange of cation between transition metal ions (M = Fe, Co, Cu, Ni, Mn, etc) and Zn2+ ions on a nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon (NC) matrix within a molten salt medium. This strategy effectively avoids phase transformations and enables the direct formation of high mass loading (3.7&#8211;4.7 wt.%) of atomically dispersed M&#8208;N4 sites. Both experimental and theoretical analyses confirm that this cation&#8208;exchange occurs at a lower temperature threshold of 450&#160;&#176;C, significantly reducing the energy barriers for SACs synthesis. Furthermore, the synthesized catalyst with atomically dispersed Fe sites demonstrate excellent performance toward oxygen reduction reaction and fuel cell with a peak power density of 1.12 W&#8201;cm&#8722;2 in an H2&#9472;O2 fuel cell at 1.0&#160;bar and 80&#160;&#176;C.

         <title>Carbon Dot&#8208;Linked Hydrogel for TAMs Transform: Spatiotemporal Manipulation to Reshape Tumor Microenvironment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CDs crosslinked egg white hydrogel loaded with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CA170 (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C) can realize spatiotemporal tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) transformation from multi&#8208;level dimensions, including spatial recruitment, cell phenotype reprogramming, and immune checkpoint molecule blockade. Finally, at the in vivo level, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C can stimulate anti&#8208;tumor immunity through tumor microenvironment (TME) remodeling and reduce tumor recurrence with satisfactory biosafety.








Abstract
As one of the most crucial immune cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME), regulating tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) is vital for enhancing antitumor immunity. Here, an injectable carbon dots (CDs)&#8208;linked egg white hydrogel was developed, termed TAMs Transform Factory (TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C), to spatiotemporally manipulate TAMs. The fabricated CDs significantly promoted macrophage migration. Notably, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C achieved macrophage spatial enrichment through CDs&#8208;induced directional recruitment with molecular Ctnnd1 upregulation. Subsequently, the recruited macrophages were locoregionally reprogrammed within TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C, as well as blocking the upregulated PD&#8208;L1. Finally, through multi&#8208;stage regulation at spatial, cellular, and molecular levels, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C released immune&#8208;activated M1 macrophages to the tumor site as it degraded. Moreover, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C promoted dendritic cell (DCs) maturation and further boosted T cell activation, thereby reshaping the tumor&#8208;suppressive TME. Through peritumoral injection, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C enhanced tumor immunotherapy in both subcutaneous and recurrent 4T1 tumor models with satisfactory biosafety. Therefore, TTF&#8208;L&#8208;C is proposed to become a safe and powerful platform for various biomedical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Carbon Capture with Fluorine&#8208;Tailored Carbon Molecular Sieve Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance carbon capture using fluorine&#8208;tailored carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes is developed. By incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups into the polymer precursor, the derived CMS membranes achieve exceptional CO&#8322; permeability of 47,190 Barrer and CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3, maintaining 36,204 Barrer permeability and 35.3 selectivity under flue gas conditions.








Abstract
Increasing energy consumption and climate change present an urgent global challenge to achieve carbon neutrality, with CO2 capture as a top priority. Among various carbon capture technologies, CO2 membrane separation stands out for its simplicity and energy efficiency in applications including gas purification and industrial gas recovery. Herein, a series of fluorine&#8208;tailored porous carbon molecular sieve (CMS) membranes derived from precisely designed precursors, achieving a well&#8208;balanced high permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation are developed. Incorporating bent terphenyl monomers and both aliphatic/aromatic trifluoromethyl groups disrupted dense chain packing and promoted pore formation with enhanced permeability and selectivity for CO2 separation. The TFM&#8208;550 membrane, derived from a fluorinated stretched polymer backbone precursor, exhibits exceptional performance with a CO2 permeability of 47&#160;190&#160;&#177;&#160;3204 Barrer and a CO2/N2 selectivity of 28.3&#160;&#177;&#160;5.7, while TFM&#8208;800 presented a higher selectivity of 71.8&#160;&#177;&#160;11.5, surpassing the 2019 upper bound. Furthermore, under flue gas conditions (CO2/O2/N2 = 1/1/4 in molar ratio), the CMS membrane demonstrate high CO2 permeability of 36,204&#160;&#177;&#160;2,235 Barrer and outstanding CO2/N2 selectivity of 35.3&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8. The results here highlight the effectiveness of fluorine tailoring and the potential of fluorinated CMS membranes for sustainable industrial carbon capture applications.

Furthermore, under flue gas conditions (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/1/4 in molar ratio), the CMS membrane demonstrate high CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; permeability of 36,204&#160;&#177;&#160;2,235 Barrer and outstanding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity of 35.3&#160;&#177;&#160;1.8.

         <title>Interlayer Expanded MXene Film Cathodes with Rich Defects for Flexible 2&#8208;Electron Oxalate&#8208;Based Li&#8211;CO2 Batteries: A New Path to Enhanced Energy Efficiency and Durability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A defect&#8208;rich, interlayer&#8208;expanded MXene (Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx&#8208;3) film cathode, with abundant uncoordinated titanium atoms, stabilizes the bi&#8208;electron pathway in Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, improving energy efficiency and durability. Its extended interlayer spacing and mesoporous structure enhance ion and CO2 transport, and the surface functionalization suppresses interfacial oxidation and maintains integrity. The battery achieves low polarization (0.39 V), high capacity (3452.33 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2), and long life (&gt;1660 h). The foldable Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx&#8208;3 cathode enables flexible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries, offering potential in wearable electronics.








Abstract
Aprotic Li&#8211;CO2 batteries have garnered significant attention owing to their high theoretical energy density and potential in zero&#8208;carbon technology. However, their practical application remains hindered by sluggish CO2 reduction/evolution reaction (CRR/CER) kinetics and limited flexibility. While 2D graphene&#8208;like materials are commonly employed to settle these issues, their four&#8208;electron pathway limits efficiency and reversibility. Herein, a defect&#8208;rich, interlayer&#8208;expanded Ti3C2Tx (Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx) film cathode is presented for flexible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries. The extended interlayer space, reduced &#9472;OH groups, and additional uncoordinated titanium atoms of Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx enable abundant catalytic active sites, enhance ion and CO2 transport, and these surface functionalizations suppress interfacial oxidation. Notably, Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx stabilizes the bi&#8208;electron product Li2C2O4 via Ti3+/Ti2+ coupling bridges, effectively preventing disproportionation into Li2CO3, thereby significantly improving CRR/CER reversibility and lowering overpotential. Benefiting from these properties, Li&#8211;CO2 batteries with Ex&#8208;Ti3C2Tx deliver a remarkable discharge capacity of 3452.33 &#181;Ah cm&#8722;2, a low polarization potential of 0.39&#160;V, an energy efficiency exceeding 88.9%, and an ultra&#8208;long cycling life (&gt;1600 h). Furthermore, the belt&#8208;shaped flexible battery exhibits excellent flexibility and stable electrochemical performance under deformation highlighting its potential in wearable electronics. This work underscores the critical role of MXene&#8208;based materials in bi&#8208;electron electrocatalytic mechanisms, providing insights for advancing reversible Li&#8211;CO2 batteries and flexible energy storage technologies.

         <title>Advanced Air Electrodes for Reversible Protonic Ceramic Electrochemical Cells: A Comprehensive Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) face challenges from sluggish and unstable oxygen reduction and evolution reactions in the air electrode. This review discusses recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, emphasizing mechanisms, performance factors, and design strategies, offering guidance for creating efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs.








Abstract
Reversible protonic ceramic electrochemical cells (R&#8208;PCECs) have great potential for efficient and clean power generation, energy storage, and sustainable synthesis of high&#8208;value chemicals. However, the sluggish and unstable kinetics of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) and oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in the air electrode hinder the R&#8208;PCEC development. Durable H+/e&#8722;/O2&#8722; triple&#8208;conducting air electrode materials are promising for enhancing reaction kinetics and improving catalytical stability. This review synthesizes the recent progress in triple&#8208;conducting air electrodes, focusing on their working mechanisms, including electrode kinetics, lattice and its defect structure in oxides, and the generation and transport processes of H+, O2&#8722;, and e&#8722;. It also examines the required physicochemical properties and their influencing factors. By synthesizing and critically analyzing the latest theoretical frameworks, advanced materials, and regulation strategies, this review outlines the challenges and prospects shaping the future of R&#8208;PCEC technology and air electrode development. Based on these theories and multiple strategies about the bulk triple conducting properties and surface chemical states, this review provides practical guidance for the rational design and development of efficient and stable air electrode materials for R&#8208;PCECs and related electrocatalytic materials.

         <title>Suppression of Charge Recombination Induced by Solid Additive Assisting Organic Solar Cells with Efficiency over 20%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The work highlights the strong morphological optimization capacity of the solid additive DIDOB and elucidates its impact on molecular packing to suppress both bimolecular and geminate recombination in OSCs. As a result, DIDOB not only demonstrates universality in various non&#8208;fullerene&#8208;based OSCs but also achieves an impressive efficiency of 20.11% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.8% in the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based device.








Abstract
A volatile solid additive strategy, which can effectively optimize the morphology of the photoactive layer with an ideal domain size and purity, has emerged as a promising approach to improve the photovoltaic performance of organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the precise role of solid additives in modulating charge and exciton dynamics, especially the recombination process, remains not fully understand. In this study, a solid additive, 1,4&#8208;diiodo&#8208;2,5&#8208;dimethoxybenzene (DIDOB), is developed to improve the photovoltaic performance of OSCs and conduct a comprehensive investigation into its effect on the charge recombination process. As a result, the PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;X&#8208;based binary OSC processed with DIDOB achieves an excellent efficiency of 19.75% with a remarkable fill factor of 81.9%, owing to the optimal fiber network morphology, tighter and ordered molecular packing, as well as the suppression of both bimolecular and geminate recombination. Notably, the DIDOB exhibits broad universality as an additive in other non&#8208;fullerene acceptor&#8208;based OSCs. Impressively, the D18:PM6:L8&#8208;BO&#8208;based ternary device processed with DIDOB yielded an excellent efficiency of 20.11% (certified as 20.03%). This work highlights the effect of the solid additive on the charge recombination process within active layer and provides insights for the further development of OSCs.

         <title>Decoupling Strategy of Metasurface to Realize Independent Sensing and Wave Manipulations at the Same Time</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this article, a decoupling strategy of metasurface to realize independent sensing and wave manipulations at the same time is proposed. By allocating the reflectivity of all meta&#8208;atoms across the space&#8208;time dimensions, it is possible to realize arbitrary manipulation of electromagnetic waves while simultaneously sensing the wireless environment by the metasurface without integrating any sensors. An adaptive STCDM system is constructed and measured, showing excellent performances of sensing and wave manipulations in wireless communication scenarios.








Abstract
In recent years, integrating electromagnetic (EM) sensing and wave manipulation has become crucial for future wireless developments, significantly enhancing the application performance by acquiring complex environmental information and optimizing the distribution of EM resources. Metasurface offers unprecedented control over sensing and wave manipulation, yet a conflict arises in achieving both simultaneously. To solve the problem, a decoupling strategy is proposed to simultaneously realize sensing and wave manipulation using a space&#8208;time&#8208;coding digital metasurface (STCDM) without integrating any sensors. A space&#8208;time&#8208;coding matrix is constructed by allocating the reflectivity of all meta&#8208; atoms across the space&#8208;time dimensions, enabling arbitrary manipulation of EM waves while simultaneously acquiring the sensing information at the incident frequency from metasurface. Excellent accuracy of direction&#8208;of&#8208;arrival estimation and wave manipulation confirms the decoupling method. An adaptive STCDM system is built up to validate the strategy in wireless communications. The measured results show that the adaptive STCDM enables independent sensing and wireless communications at the same time for targets located at different positions without integrating any sensors. The proposed method may find potential applications in wireless communication, radar, and Internet of Things systems.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, integrating electromagnetic (EM) sensing and wave manipulation has become crucial for future wireless developments, significantly enhancing the application performance by acquiring complex environmental information and optimizing the distribution of EM resources. Metasurface offers unprecedented control over sensing and wave manipulation, yet a conflict arises in achieving both simultaneously. To solve the problem, a decoupling strategy is proposed to simultaneously realize sensing and wave manipulation using a space-time-coding digital metasurface (STCDM) without integrating any sensors. A space-time-coding matrix is constructed by allocating the reflectivity of all meta- atoms across the space-time dimensions, enabling arbitrary manipulation of EM waves while simultaneously acquiring the sensing information at the incident frequency from metasurface. Excellent accuracy of direction-of-arrival estimation and wave manipulation confirms the decoupling method. An adaptive STCDM system is built up to validate the strategy in wireless communications. The measured results show that the adaptive STCDM enables independent sensing and wireless communications at the same time for targets located at different positions without integrating any sensors. The proposed method may find potential applications in wireless communication, radar, and Internet of Things systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nonlinear Optical Properties of 0D Chiral Hybrid Bismuth Iodides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically stable lead&#8208;free 0D chiral (R/S&#8208;methyl&#8208;benzyl&#8208;amine)&#8208;bismuth&#8208;iodide crystals showcase promising second and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical properties. The chiral compounds show significant circularly polarized second harmonic generation. The achiral counterpart exhibits the most efficient third&#8208;order optical nonlinearity.








Abstract
Chiral hybrid metal halides show great promise for nonlinear optical (NLO) applications like circularly polarized second harmonic generation (SHG). The inherent toxicity of lead is a concern for the widespread adoption of frequently explored lead&#8208;based chiral hybrid halides. Here, we report the second and third&#8208;order NLO properties of lead&#8208;free 0D chiral compounds, (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10, and their achiral counterpart, (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 (MBA: methylbenzylammonium) under excitation wavelength ranging 1360&#8211;1590&#160;nm. Chiral (R&#8208;/S&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits strong SHG along with stronger third harmonic generation (THG). The chiral crystals showed high sensitivity to the handedness of circularly polarized pump light (gSHG &#8722; CD &#8776; 9% at 1510&#160;nm). The THG response shows resonance enhancement matching the excitonic absorption. Achiral (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibits the maximum THG response (&#967;(3) = 1.05 &#215; 10&#8315;&#185;&#8312;&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2). Z&#8208;scan measurements with non&#8208;resonant femtosecond pulse excitation at 800&#160;nm yield high nonlinear absorption coefficients (&#946;) and nonlinear refractive index (n2) for all three samples, with (Rac&#8208;MBA)4Bi2I10 exhibiting the highest values. These hybrid chiral metal halides, with efficient second and third&#8208;order nonlinearity, and high optical stability, are potential candidates for NLO applications such as Kerr&#8208;based optical switching, circularly polarized up&#8208;conversion, and communication.

         <title>Simultaneously Tailoring Hydrostability and Photoelectroactivity in Heterocluster Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first heterocluster&#8208;based crystalline MOF photocatalysts integrating copper&#8208;sulfur and copper&#8208;halide clusters are obtained through the heterocluster assembly engineering and localized microenvironment regulation, demonstrating an unprecedented synergistic enhancement of hydrostability and photoelectroactivity, facilitating the efficient synthesis of green hydrogen at an exceptionally high rate under visible light.








Abstract
The simultaneous enhancement of structural stability and photoelectroactivity in metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) remains a critical challenge for sustainable photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production. Herein, an atomically&#8208;precise heterocluster assembly approach is presented to construct two isostructural 3D MOFs, CuSL&#8208;CuX (X = Cl, Br), featuring a cds net. CuSL&#8208;CuXs integrate hexanuclear copper&#8208;sulfur {Cu6S6} cluster and dinuclear copper&#8208;halogen {Cu2X2} cluster, which not only impart exceptional stability across a broad pH range (1&#8211;14) but also enable wide visible&#8208;light absorption, tailored redox potentials, and efficient charge&#8208;carrier dynamics. Notably, halogen substitution markedly boosts photocatalytic activity: CuSL&#8208;CuBr achieves an efficient H2 evolution rate of 50.28&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 without noble metals, doubling that of CuSL&#8208;CuCl (26.99&#160;mmol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1) and surpassing most reported MOF&#8208;based photocatalysts. Both experimental and theoretical investigations indicate that bromine substitution optimizes electronic structure, refines orbital distribution, and accelerates charge separation, ultimately leading to promoted photocatalytic efficiency. This research provides insights into the structure&#8208;property interplay in heterocluster MOFs and establishes a paradigm for designing robust, high&#8208;performance photocatalysts through precise cluster engineering.

         <title>Tailoring Synergistic Ion Environment for Copper Telluride toward High&#8208;Capacity and Ultrastable Acidic Multivalent&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes are disclosed in acidic multivalent&#8208;ion batteries for the first time to achieve a high capacity of up to 409 mAh g&#8722;1 and a long cycling lifespan of 40&#8201;000 cycles. Composite in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction measurements and spectroscopic analyses show that the synergistic copper&#8208;ion/proton electrolyte environment ensures stable reversible storage of copper&#8208;ions and prevents potential material oxidation.








Abstract
Acidic batteries permit a reliable energy supply at low temperatures with low cost and intrinsic safety, yet the development of stable acid&#8208;resistant electrodes with high capacity and a reliable lifespan is still challenging. Herein, nonstoichiometric copper telluride (Cu2&#8208;xTe) nanosheets are first explored as high&#8208;performance electrodes for acidic batteries to provide a stable capacity release of 409 mAh g&#8722;1 with a record&#8208;breaking lifespan of 40&#160;000 cycles and excellent kinetics, enabling operation at a high current density of 20 A g&#8722;1. In contrast to the inherent perception of corrosive destruction of electrode materials by strongly acidic environments, the electrolyte environment enriched with copper ions and hydrogen ions synergistically stabilizes the Cu2&#8208;xTe electrode and drives reversible multielectron transfer asymmetric deep conversion, which is confirmed by in situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, first&#8208;principal calculations, and composite electrochemical characterization. Therefore, Cu2&#8208;xTe provides an impressive accumulation capacity of over 4764 Ah g&#8722;1, exceeding that of most acidic batteries, and works well at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C. High&#8208;performance Cu2&#8208;xTe electrodes also promote the establishment of Cu2&#8208;xTe//Mn2O3 and Cu2&#8208;xTe//Fe acidic full cells enabling stable operation at room temperature and low temperature, offering promising opportunities for electrode progress in advanced acidic batteries.

         <title>Harnessing Near&#8208;Infrared Light for Enhanced Solar Hydrogen Production from Escherichia coli Interfaced with Biocompatible Low&#8208;Bandgap Conjugated Polymer Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets are interfaced with non&#8208;photosynthetic and non&#8208;genetic engineered Escherichia coli for solar hydrogen production using near&#8208;infrared light. The rationally designed polymer nanosheets play a crucial role in harnessing the broad solar spectrum and injecting photo&#8208;generated electrons into bacteria, thereby enhancing hydrogen production.








Abstract
The efficient conversion of solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel presents a promising pathway for sustainable energy production. However, utilizing the full solar spectrum, particularly the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) region, remains underexplored in photosynthetic biohybrid systems. In this study, biocompatible, low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets (PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB) are developed to integrate with non&#8208;photosynthetic, non&#8208;genetically engineered Escherichia coli (E. coli) for enhanced solar&#8208;driven biological hydrogen production. The PyTT&#8208;tBAL&#8208;HAB nanosheets exhibit unique NIR light absorption properties. Integrating these nanosheets with E. coli facilitates efficient electron transfer, resulting in a 1.96&#8208;fold increase in hydrogen production rate under NIR light. Consequently, this photosynthetic biohybrid system achieves a quantum efficiency of 18.36% at 940&#160;nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using low&#8208;bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets as advanced photosensitizers in semi&#8208;artificial photosynthetic systems, offering a robust platform for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum.

&lt;p&gt;The efficient conversion of solar energy into clean hydrogen fuel presents a promising pathway for sustainable energy production. However, utilizing the full solar spectrum, particularly the near-infrared (NIR) region, remains underexplored in photosynthetic biohybrid systems. In this study, biocompatible, low-bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets (PyTT-tBAL-HAB) are developed to integrate with non-photosynthetic, non-genetically engineered &lt;i&gt;Escherichia coli&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt;) for enhanced solar-driven biological hydrogen production. The PyTT-tBAL-HAB nanosheets exhibit unique NIR light absorption properties. Integrating these nanosheets with &lt;i&gt;E. coli&lt;/i&gt; facilitates efficient electron transfer, resulting in a 1.96-fold increase in hydrogen production rate under NIR light. Consequently, this photosynthetic biohybrid system achieves a quantum efficiency of 18.36% at 940&#160;nm. This study demonstrates the potential of using low-bandgap conjugated polymer nanosheets as advanced photosensitizers in semi-artificial photosynthetic systems, offering a robust platform for the effective utilization of the solar spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Azepination&#8208;Induced Frontier Molecular Orbital Delocalization of Multiple Resonance Emitters: Constructing Highly Efficient Narrowband Electroluminescent Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of multiple resonance (MR) emitters is proposed to construct long&#8208;wavelength MR materials. Organic light&#8208;emitting diode based on m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz exhibits excellent electroluminescence performances with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.26, 0.70) and a maximum external quantum efficiency of 36.2%.








Abstract
Developing diversified construction strategies for high&#8208;color&#8208;purity and efficient multiple resonance thermally activated delayed fluorescence (MR&#8208;TADF) materials is a major strategic demand to meet the requirements of ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition organic light&#8208;emitting diode (OLED) displays, posing a significant challenge to the design and synthesis of emitters at the molecular level. Herein, a strategy is proposed for azepination&#8208;induced frontier molecular orbital (FMO) delocalization of MR emitters, that is, embedding azepine into the prototype molecule BNCz can effectively improve the &#960;&#8208;conjugation degree and extend the FMO delocalization, thereby constructing a series of long&#8208;wavelength MR&#8208;TADF materials with narrowband emission. Through an intramolecular Scholl reaction, these target molecules with an azepine&#8208;embedded core are afforded by one&#8208;fold heptagonal cyclization of BNCz core and the phenyl ring attached to (aromatic amine&#8208;substituted) aryl precursor. They all exhibit efficient green emission around 520&#160;nm and narrow full&#8208;widths at half&#8208;maximum (FWHMs) of &#8804; 37&#160;nm in toluene. OLEDs employing these emitters show excellent electroluminescence (EL) performances, among which m&#8208;PAz&#8208;BNCz&#8208;based OLED exhibits the optimal EL performances with a peak of 528&#160;nm, a FWHM of 37&#160;nm, Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage (CIE) coordinates of (0.26, 0.70), and a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 36.2%.

         <title>Europium(II) Complex with d&#8208;f Transition: New Emitter for Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Electrochemical Cells with an External Quantum Efficiency of 19.8%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A lanthanide Eu(II) complex is demonstrated as an emitter in&#160;light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) for the first time. The bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II)&#160;complex based LEC achieved a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8% with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18).








Abstract
Light&#8208;emitting electrochemical cells (LECs) have good prospects in the solid&#8208;state lighting field due to their simple single&#8208;layer structure and low manufacturing cost. However, the lack of high&#8208;efficiency blue LECs limits their development and further application. To solve this problem, many luminescent materials with various mechanisms such as fluorescence, phosphorescence, and thermally&#8208;activated delayed fluorescence are studied as emitters in LECs. Besides these materials, herein lanthanide europium(II) (Eu(II)) complex with d&#8208;f transition is demonstrated as a new type of emitter for LECs. In detail, a blue emitting Eu(II) complex bis[hydrotris(3&#8208;tert&#8208;butylpyrazolyl)borate]europium(II) is dispersed into 9&#8208;(3&#8208;(triphenylsilyl)phenyl)&#8208;9H&#8208;3,9&#8242;&#8208;bicarbazole host and tetrahexylammonium tetrafluoroborate electrolyte to make a blend film, which attains a high photoluminescence quantum yield of &#8776;100%. The LEC using the blend film as an active layer achieves a blue emission with Commission Internationale de L'Eclairage coordinates of (0.12, 0.18) and a record&#8208;breaking external quantum efficiency of 19.8%, corresponding to an exciton utilization efficiency of &#8776;100%. This work reveals that Eu(II) complex with d&#8208;f transition is a promising emitter toward high&#8208;performance blue LECs, which can inspire further research on Eu(II) complex based LECs.

         <title>Robust Homogeneous Segmented Power Generator Driven by Sb2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Cd&#8211;S co&#8208;alloying&#8208;induced microstructural evolution enables high&#8208;performance Sb2Te3&#8208;based thermoelectrics. Subsequently, an innovative full&#8208;scale Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te segmented power generator is fabricated, extending the operational range of conventional Bi2Te3&#8208;based modules from 500 to 650 K and achieving an exceptional efficiency of 9.3% under a distinct &#916;T = 350 K. Notably, it exhibits remarkable stability after 80&#8208;cycle thermal shock and 160&#8208;h thermal durability, highlighting great potential for low&#8208;grade waste heat recovery.








Abstract
Thermoelectric (TE) technology offers a promising solution for waste heat recovery, particularly in applications involving abundant low&#8208;grade heat (&lt;650 K). However, for over half a century, TE power generators have predominantly relied on Bi2Te3 alloys with limited efficiencies below 7%. Herein, Cd and S are doped into Sb2Te3 to promote microstructural regulation characterized by dense twin boundaries and dislocations, resulting in a 45% reduction of lattice thermal conductivity at 300 K. Combined with the optimized density&#8208;of&#8208;states effective mass and expanded band gap, the Cd0.04Sb1.96Te2.94S0.06 sample attains a peak ZT of 1.1 at 650 K and an average ZT of 1.0 from 500 to 650 K, while exhibiting remarkable compressive and bending strengths of 197 and 56&#160;MPa. Most importantly, a well&#8208;designed, homogeneous segmented TE power generator, constructed entirely from Bi&#8211;Sb&#8211;Te alloys, achieves a remarkable efficiency of 9.3% under a temperature gradient of 350 K, as certified by third&#8208;party validation. This work provides new insights into extending the operation temperature of Bi2Te3, demonstrating great potential for low&#8208;grade waste heat harvest.

         <title>Designing Cellulose Triacetate&#8208;Based Universal Binder for High&#8208;Voltage Sodium&#8208;Ion Battery Cathodes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Binding Strength</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cellulose triacetate&#8208;based binder with broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, and superior binding strength has been successfully designed and validated through its application in high&#8208;voltage polyanionic cathodes (Na3V2(PO4)2O2F), layered oxide cathodes (NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2), and tunnel&#8208;type oxide cathodes (Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2). This work presents a sustainable and effective strategy for achieving high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Binders play a pivotal role in the performance of sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIB) cathodes, but traditional binders often struggle to balance broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, superior binding strength, and environmental sustainability. In this study, a universal cellulose triacetate (TAC)&#8208;based binder (TAC&#8208;MMT) composed of TAC and natural montmorillonite (MMT) is designed to facilitate rapid Na+ transport pathways and establish a robust hydrogen&#8208;bonding network. This innovative TAC&#8208;MMT binder features a unique chemical structure that achieves high ionic conductivity through a self&#8208;enrichment and fast&#8208;transport mechanism, while its superior binding strength is attributed to hydrogen&#8208;bonding crosslinks between proton acceptors (C&#9552;O) in TAC and proton donors (&#8722;OH) in MMT. More importantly, the outstanding solubility and film&#8208;forming properties of TAC&#8208;MMT contribute to stable electrode protection and broad compatibility with high&#8208;voltage SIB cathodes. Benefiting from these advantages, the Na3V2(PO4)2O2F (NVPOF) electrodes with the TAC&#8208;MMT binder demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high capacity retention of 95.2% over 500 cycles at 5C and a rapid rate response of up to 15C. The versatility of the TAC&#8208;MMT binder is further confirmed with high&#8208;voltage NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 and Na0.61[Mn0.27Fe0.34Ti0.39]O2 cathodes. This study highlights the potential of biomass&#8208;based binders as a sustainable and effective solution for advancing high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries.

     alt="Designing Cellulose Triacetate-Based Universal Binder for High-Voltage Sodium-Ion Battery Cathodes with Enhanced Ionic Conductivity and Binding Strength"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cellulose triacetate-based binder with broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, and superior binding strength has been successfully designed and validated through its application in high-voltage polyanionic cathodes (Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F), layered oxide cathodes (NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and tunnel-type oxide cathodes (Na&lt;sub&gt;0.61&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.27&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.34&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.39&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Binders play a pivotal role in the performance of sodium-ion battery (SIB) cathodes, but traditional binders often struggle to balance broad compatibility, high ionic conductivity, superior binding strength, and environmental sustainability. In this study, a universal cellulose triacetate (TAC)-based binder (TAC-MMT) composed of TAC and natural montmorillonite (MMT) is designed to facilitate rapid Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport pathways and establish a robust hydrogen-bonding network. This innovative TAC-MMT binder features a unique chemical structure that achieves high ionic conductivity through a self-enrichment and fast-transport mechanism, while its superior binding strength is attributed to hydrogen-bonding crosslinks between proton acceptors (C&#9552;O) in TAC and proton donors (&#8722;OH) in MMT. More importantly, the outstanding solubility and film-forming properties of TAC-MMT contribute to stable electrode protection and broad compatibility with high-voltage SIB cathodes. Benefiting from these advantages, the Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;F (NVPOF) electrodes with the TAC-MMT binder demonstrate exceptional performance, including a high capacity retention of 95.2% over 500 cycles at 5C and a rapid rate response of up to 15C. The versatility of the TAC-MMT binder is further confirmed with high-voltage NaNi&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;1/3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Na&lt;sub&gt;0.61&lt;/sub&gt;[Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.27&lt;/sub&gt;Fe&lt;sub&gt;0.34&lt;/sub&gt;Ti&lt;sub&gt;0.39&lt;/sub&gt;]O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cathodes.

         <title>Multiple Functional Engineering Strategies and Active Site Identification in Ru&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for Catalytic Conversion Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides a comprehensive analysis of engineering modification strategies for ruthenium (Ru)&#8208;based catalysts, highlighting their critical role in optimizing electronic structures and surface properties to enhance electrocatalytic conversion. Furthermore, it emphasizes the integration of multiple engineering strategies aimed at improving catalytic performance, while also addressing key commercialization challenges.








Abstract
Electrochemical conversion has been regarded as an ideal technology for achieving clean and sustainable energy, showing significant promise in addressing the increasingly serious energy crisis and environmental pollution. Ru&#8208;containing electrocatalysts (RUCE) outperform other precious metals due to elevated intrinsic activity and superior cost&#8208;effectiveness, developing into a promising candidate for electrochemical conversion reactions. A significant challenge in the field of catalyst discovery lies in its heavy reliance on empirical methods, rather than approaches that are rooted in rational design principles. This review first concentrates on the catalytically active sites and critical factors governing catalytic activity and performance durability. Then, a comprehensive summary of multifunctional modification strategies ranging from nanoscale to atomic scale is explored to control the structure and improve the performance. By unveiling the roles of each component in the modified RUCE at the atomic level, their intrinsic active sites are identified and discussed to establish the structure&#8208;performance relationship of the catalysts. Finally, the challenges and perspectives of Ru&#8208;based materials for electrochemical hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen conversion reactions are presented to inspire further efforts toward understanding RUCE to meet the ever&#8208;growing demand in the future.

         <title>Electrochemical Lattice Engineering of Bismuthene for Selective Glycine Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Bi&#8208;based catalyst is developed via the electrochemical transformation of bismuth&#8208;oxide composites, inducing enhanced lattice strain to optimize catalytic performance. At an applied potential of &#8722;0.76&#160;V versus RHE, the catalyst exhibits outstanding efficiency in glycine electrosynthesis, achieving a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1% and a record&#8208;high glycine concentration of 0.17&#160;m, significantly outperforming conventional Bi&#8208;based systems. Moreover, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants further elevate the glycine FE to 91.3%, with an impressive production rate of 2433.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 under identical conditions.








Abstract
Glycine plays a crucial role in various industrial and daily applications. However, traditional synthesis methods are often associated with high toxicity, energy intensity, and inefficiency. This study introduces an efficient and eco&#8208;friendly method for synthesizing glycine via the reductive coupling of oxalic acid and nitrate using a Bi metal catalyst, enhanced by lattice strain from Bi and oxide composites undergoing electrochemical transformation. At an applied potential of &#8722;0.76&#160;V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), the Bi catalyst achieves an impressive glycine Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 79.1%, yielding a record concentration of 0.17&#160;m, substantially higher than conventional Bi&#8208;based systems. Furthermore, the introduction of glycolaldehyde and hydroxylamine as reactants raise the glycine FE to 91.3% with a production rate of 2433.3&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;1 under identical conditions. Electrochemical analysis and theoretical calculations demonstrate that lattice expansion notably boosts glycine synthesis by facilitating NH2OH formation and promoting the efficient reduction of oxime intermediates. These results underscore the significance of lattice engineering in enhancing active site performance and accelerating reaction kinetics, offering a sustainable and efficient alternative to traditional glycine synthesis methods.

         <title>Simultaneous Heavy&#8208;Metal Ion Adsorption and Electricity Generation From Wastewater via &#8220;Heavy&#8208;Metal Removal Batteries&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed, which displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity generation. In such battery, the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes. Furthermore, a chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, achieving the recycling of the electrodes.








Abstract
The heavy&#8208;metal ion in wastewater is a great threat to the health of both humans and ecosystems. The common heavy&#8208;metal ion removal strategies usually suffer from energy consumption and poor recyclability. Herein, a heavy&#8208;metal removal battery is designed by constructing a two&#8208;chamber configuration. Such battery displays the capacity of simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption and electricity output, where heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption is driven by the potential difference between adsorption electrodes and metal electrodes, and electricity is generated continuously during the adsorption process. Significantly, various heavy&#8208;metal ions (e.g., Mn2+, Co2+, Ni2+, Zn2+, Cr3+ and Pb2+ ions) can be removed due to the large lattice spacing of active materials in adsorption electrodes, displaying the universality of adsorbing heavy&#8208;metal ions from wastewater. In addition, an environmental&#8208;friendly chemical oxidation strategy is developed to desorb heavy&#8208;metal ions from adsorption electrodes, which not only produces high&#8208;quality metal salts, but also reduces the toxicity of sludge in the case of secondary pollution. Impressively, these heavy&#8208;metal removal batteries can be easily scaled up and integrated to extend the heavy&#8208;metal ion adsorption ability and voltage/current output. This work proves a creative approach for simultaneous heavy&#8208;metal ion removal and electricity generation from wastewater.

The TOC illustrates Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325;, Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325;, and double perovskite suspensions, the 3D&#8208;printed &#8220;MIZZOU&#8221; text under 325 nm laser excitation, the corresponding emission spectra of the color conversion layer, and the CIE 1976 (u', v') color space of the fabricated white LED.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites and their derivatives have emerged as highly promising materials for next&#8208;generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their intrinsic defect tolerance and exceptional electrical and optical properties. Among these, lead&#8208;free copper(I)&#8208;based halide perovskite derivatives, Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br, I) (CHPs), have garnered significant attention as environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskites. In this study, a cost&#8208;effective and sustainable synthesis route for Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; powders is developed, which exhibit strong green (&#8776;526&#160;nm) and blue (&#8776;458&#160;nm) emissions, and achieve remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 100% and 92%, respectively. Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders are incorporated into 3D&#8208;printed structures, exhibiting excellent transparency and color stability. Furthermore, white LEDs are fabricated by using the green&#8208;emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and blue&#8208;emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; and a yellow&#8208;emitting double perovskite (PLQY&#8776; 73%), resulting in devices with an exceptionally high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 98 and tunable correlated color temperatures (CCTs) ranging from 3864 to 9677 K, closely mimicking natural white light. Beyond solid&#8208;state lighting, the superior optical performance and stability of Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders open new avenues for their application in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The TOC illustrates Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325;, Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325;, and double perovskite suspensions, the 3D-printed &#8220;MIZZOU&#8221; text under 325 nm laser excitation, the corresponding emission spectra of the color conversion layer, and the CIE 1976 (u', v') color space of the fabricated white LED.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal halide perovskites and their derivatives have emerged as highly promising materials for next-generation optoelectronic devices, owing to their intrinsic defect tolerance and exceptional electrical and optical properties. Among these, lead-free copper(I)-based halide perovskite derivatives, Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br, I) (CHPs), have garnered significant attention as environmentally friendly and stable alternatives to lead-based perovskites. In this study, a cost-effective and sustainable synthesis route for Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; powders is developed, which exhibit strong green (&#8776;526&#160;nm) and blue (&#8776;458&#160;nm) emissions, and achieve remarkable photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) of 100% and 92%, respectively. Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders are incorporated into 3D-printed structures, exhibiting excellent transparency and color stability. Furthermore, white LEDs are fabricated by using the green-emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Cl&#8325; and blue-emitting Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;Br&#8325; and a yellow-emitting double perovskite (PLQY&#8776; 73%), resulting in devices with an exceptionally high color rendering index (CRI) of up to 98 and tunable correlated color temperatures (CCTs) ranging from 3864 to 9677 K, closely mimicking natural white light. Beyond solid-state lighting, the superior optical performance and stability of Cs&#8323;Cu&#8322;X&#8325; (X = Cl, Br) powders open new avenues for their application in photovoltaics and other optoelectronic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enabling High Performance in a Positive Potential of Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Electrocatalysis Over Mesoporous Core@Shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu Nanozyme</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mesoporous core@shell Cu2O/Cu@PdCu nanozymes are demonstrated as efficient tandem electrocatalyst for highly selective NH3 electrosynthesis from NO3&#8722; at fairly positive potentials. Meanwhile, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst performs perfectly in the two&#8208;electrode coupling system for cathode NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 and anode ethanol oxidation in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner.








Abstract
Electrocatalytic tandem nitrate reduction to ammonia (NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3) offers a promising pathway for energy and environmental sustainability. Although considerable efforts have been presented to modulate the reaction pathways for enhanced NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis, these advances often require relatively high overpotentials to balance yield rate and selectivity of NH3, resulting in a remarkable energy inefficiency. Inspired by enzyme catalysis in nature, herein a tandem enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst is designed consisting of a core of Cu2O/Cu heterojunction surrounded by mesoporous PdCu shell (Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu) that accelerated NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Impressively, Cu2O/Cu@mesoPdCu nanozymes hold superior performance for robust NH3 electrosynthesis in a fairly positive potential of 0.10&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode), having Faraday efficiency of 96.2%, yield rate of 13.3&#160;mg h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1, and half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of 46.0%. Kinetic studies, in situ spectra and density functional theory calculations revealed that Cu2O/Cu core preferentially adsorbed NO3&#8722; and further reduced to *NO2, while active hydrogen radicals enriched on PdCu shell promoted multistep hydrodeoxygenation of *NO2 to NH3 within &#8220;semi&#8208;closed&#8221; mesoporous microenvironment, both of which synergistically enabled tandem electrocatalysis in positive potentials. Moreover, this enzyme&#8208;like electrocatalyst disclosed better NO3&#8722;&#8208;to&#8208;NH3 performance in a more energy&#8208;efficient manner when coupling with more thermodynamically favorable ethanol oxidation reaction.

         <title>Residue&#8208;Free Fabrication of 2D Materials Using van der Waals Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Residue&#8208;free 2D materials with exceptional cleanliness and high quality are achieved using van der Waals interaction&#8208;based fabrication and manipulation techniques, completely free from polymers and solvents. Precise manipulation enables the construction of vdW heterostructures with controlled alignment, expanding the potential of 2D materials for next&#8208;generation electronic and optoelectronic devices.








Abstract
2D materials have garnered considerable attention due to their distinctive properties, prompting diverse applications across various domains. Beyond their inherent qualities, the significance of 2D materials extends into the fabrication processes that can lead to the degradation of intrinsic performance through undesirable mechanical defects and surface contaminations. Herein, a novel fabrication technique to achieve residue&#8208;free 2D materials using van der Waals (vdW) interactions, primarily employing molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is proposed. Optical and electrical characterizations confirm the absence of residues, mechanical defects, oxidation, and strain, along with a prominent field&#8208;effect mobility of up to 60 cm2&#160;V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and an on/off ratio of &#8776;108. Furthermore, the utilization of residue&#8208;free material as a stamp enables various manipulations of flakes transferred on substrates in advance, including pick&#8208;up and release, stacking, exfoliation, wiping&#8208;out, flipping, and smoothing&#8208;out processes. Additionally, the manipulation techniques also facilitate the fabrication of vdW heterostructures with precise positioning and the desired stacking order. In this regard, the feasibility of applying this method to hexagonal boron nitride and graphite is demonstrated. It is expected that this method will offer a versatile and effective approach to enhancing the qualities of 2D material&#8208;based electronic and optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Electric Field&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Gradient Heterojunction Diodes Toward Ultrasensitive Self&#8208;Powered Ionic Skin</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal strategy for constructing ultrasensitive self&#8208;powered sensing materials with dual&#8208;gradient heterojunctions is developed through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution under direct current electric field.








Abstract
The hydrogel ionic diode is regarded as a promising self&#8208;powered sensor, capable of harvesting energy from low&#8208;frequency stimuli human motions and converting it into electrical signals. However, the sensitivity of the reported conventional bilayer hydrogel ionic diodes are relatively low, due to the single heterojunction interface and high interface resistance, making it challenging to meet the demands of high&#8208;precision sensing. Here, a universal method for fabricating dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel ionic diodes without bilayer structure through the induction of anionic and cationic polymer gradient distribution via a direct current electric field is developed. Due to the dual&#8208;gradient distribution, numerous heterogeneous microstructures (i.e., microdiodes) with low interface resistance are formed in the bulk phase of hydrogel, and these series&#8208;connected microdiodes demonstrate a significantly increase in open circuit voltage in response to mechanical pressure. The dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel ionic diode exhibits ultra&#8208;high sensitivity (1247.3&#160;mV/MPa) and ultralow detection limit (0.8&#160;Pa), enabling the smart prosthetic hand to non&#8208;destructive grasp ultrasoft tofu. This work is expected to pave the way for novel high&#8208;precision self&#8208;powered sensors in intelligent wearable electronics.

Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes
This cross&#8208;sectional STEM image captures the wave&#8208;like rippling observed in an organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid 2D MXene. Here, these ripples, often referred to as Ripplocations, are formed when the organic surface groups are exposed to the electron beam. Ripplocations are a fundamental defect in layered materials and may play a key role in how the material responds to stress and external conditions. More details can be found in article number 2411669 by Francisco Lagunas, Robert F. Klie, and co&#8208;workers.

In article number 2414519, Yixiong Feng. Jingyu Sun, Xiuju Song, and co&#8208;workers present a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated cadmium telluride (Cr2Te3)&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8208;LM) droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, non&#8208;adhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magneto&#8208;interactive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic&#8208;material&#8208;based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.

         <title>The Influence of Ionizing Radiation on Quantification for In Situ and Operando Liquid&#8208;Phase Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy enables visualization of nanoscale processes involving liquid media. Yet, it suffers from beam effects, such as radiolysis of the liquid, sample heating, and membrane charging. This review summarizes beam effect fundamentals, describes modeling and assessment, and illustrates handling strategies. The findings are transferable to other ionizing radiation techniques using, for example,&#160;&#947;&#8208; or X&#8208;rays.








Abstract
The ionizing radiation harnessed in electron microscopes or synchrotrons enables unique insights into nanoscale dynamics. In liquid&#8208;phase transmission electron microscopy (LP&#8208;TEM), irradiating a liquid sample with electrons offers access to real space information at an unmatched combination of temporal and spatial resolution. However, employing ionizing radiation for imaging can alter the Gibbs free energy landscape during the experiment. This is mainly due to radiolysis and the corresponding shift in chemical potential; however, experiments can also be affected by irradiation&#8208;induced charging and heating. In this review, the state of the art in describing beam effects is summarized, theoretical and experimental assessment guidelines are provided, and strategies to obtain quantitative information under such conditions are discussed. While this review showcases these effects on LP&#8208;TEM, the concepts that are discussed here can also be applied to other types of ionizing radiation used to probe liquid samples, such as synchrotron X&#8208;rays.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

         <title>Multi&#8208;material Volumetric Bioprinting and Plug&#8208;and&#8208;play Suspension Bath Biofabrication via Bioresin Molecular Weight Tuning and via Multiwavelength Alignment Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

&lt;p&gt;Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell-laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light-based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial-selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi-material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light-responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear-yielding behavior offers a new, single-component, ready-to-use suspension medium for in-bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof-of-concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin-producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi-color printer, complex multi-material and multi-cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>In Situ Formation of Ripplocations in Hybrid Organic&#8211;Inorganic MXenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D&#160;transition metal carbides with amino surface groups that exhibit interesting optical properties. The sensitivity of the organic material under high&#8208;energy electron beams complicates conventional TEM analysis. Using cryogenic STEM, we show h&#8208;MXenes are stable until a critical dose threshold. Beyond that threshold, the in situ generation of ripplocations is observed.









Abstract
Inorganic&#8211;organic hybrid MXenes (h&#8208;MXenes) are a family of 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides functionalized with alkylimido and alkylamido surface groups. Using cryogenic and room temperature scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) and electron energy&#8208;loss spectroscopy (EELS), it is shown that ripplocations, a form of a fundamental defect in 2D and layered structures, are abundant in this family of materials. Furthermore, detailed studies of electron probe sample interactions, focusing on structural deformations caused by the electron beam are presented. The findings indicate that at cryogenic temperatures (&#8776;100&#160;K) and below a specific dose threshold, the structure of h&#8208;MXenes remains largely intact. However, exceeding this threshold leads to electron beam&#8208;induced deformation through ripplocations. Interestingly, the deformation behavior, required dose, and resultant structure are highly dependent on temperature. At 100&#160;K, it is demonstrated that the electron beam can induce ripplocations in situ with a high degree of precision.

         <title>Self&#8208;Oxygenating PROTAC Microneedle for Spatiotemporally&#8208;Confined Protein Degradation and Enhanced Glioblastoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oxygenating PROTAC microneedle (MN)&#160;is engineered to circumvent the blood&#8208;brain&#8208;barrier (BBB) and achieve spatiotemporally&#8208;confined bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4) protein degradation. PPT7 NPs are swiftly released for rapid cellular uptake, confining the region of photodynamic therapy (PDT) and ARV771 production upon 671 nm laser irradiation. BM NPs are continuously released for generating oxygen (O2) to alleviate tumor hypoxia. This PROTAC&#8208;delivered MN significantly inhibits&#160;tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models.









Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) is the most aggressive subtype of primary brain tumors, which marginally respond&#160;to standard chemotherapy due to the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and the low tumor specificity of the therapeutics. Herein, a double&#8208;layered microneedle (MN) patch is rationally engineered by integrating acid and light dual&#8208;activatable PROteolysis TArgeting Chimera (PROTAC) nanoparticles and self&#8208;oxygenating BSA&#8208;MnO2 (BM) nanoparticles for GBM treatment. The MN is administrated at the tumor site to locally deliver the PROTAC prodrug and BM nanoparticles. The PROTAC nanoparticles are rapidly released from the outer layer of the MN and specifically activated in the acidic intracellular environment of tumor cells. Subsequently, near&#8208;infrared light activates the photosensitizer to produce singlet oxygen (1O2) through photodynamic therapy (PDT), thereby triggering spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable degradation of bromodomain and extraterminal protein 4 (BRD4). The BM nanoparticles, in the inner layer of the MN, serve as an oxygen supply station, and counteracts tumor hypoxia by converting hydrogen peroxide&#160;(H2O2) into oxygen (O2), thus promoting PDT and PROTAC activation. This PROTAC prodrug&#8208;integrated MN significantly inhibits tumor growth in both subcutaneous and orthotopic GBM tumor models. This study describes the first spatiotemporally&#8208;tunable protein degradation strategy for highly efficient GBM therapy, potentially advancing precise therapy of other kinds of refractory brain tumors.

         <title>Polyamine&#8208;Depleting Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Organic Frameworks Unleash Dendritic Cell and T Cell Vigor for Targeted CRISPR/Cas&#8208;Assisted Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A microfluidic&#8208;assisted hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) nanoplatforms depletes polyamines in the tumor microenvironment, reversing T&#8208;cell immunosuppression and enhancing dendritic cell activity. By releasing CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 and inducing neoantigen generation via carbonyl stress and mutational burden elevation, this system enables precision cancer immunotherapy through dual&#8208;action mechanisms targeting both immune vigor and tumor vulnerability.








Abstract
Polyamines have tantalized cancer researchers as a potential means to rein in the rampant growth of cancer cells. However, clinical trials in recent decades have disappointed in delivering notable progress. Herein, a microfluidic&#8208;assisted synthetic hydrogen&#8208;bond organic framework (HOF) as a polyamine&#8208;depleting nanoplatforms designed to unleash the vigor of both dendritic cells (DCs) and T cells for precision cancer immunotherapy is reported. Upon internalization by tumor cells, the loaded plasma amine oxidase (PAO) in HOF efficiently depletes polyamines, remolding the tumor microenvironment and alleviating T&#8208;cell immunosuppression. This process also generates acrolein and H2O2, triggering CRISPR&#8208;assisted neoantigen generation. Specifically, Acrolein induces carbonyl stress, increasing mutational burdens. Simultaneously, HOF leverages the energy from the bis[2,4,5&#8208;trichloro&#8208;6&#8208;(pentyloxycarbonyl)phenyl] oxalate (CPPO)&#8208;H2O2 reaction for CRET&#8208;triggered singlet oxygen production, leading to thioether bond cleavage and release CRISPR&#8208;Cas9. Once released, CRISPR&#8208;Cas9 knocks out the DNA mismatch repair (MMR)&#8208;related MLH1 gene, further elevating mutational burdens and generating neoantigens, ideal targets for DCs. This dual&#8208;action strategy not only corrects T&#8208;cell immunosuppression but also enhances DC efficacy, presenting a powerful approach for tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Hyperspectral Metachip&#8208;Based 3D Spatial Map for Cancer Cell Screening and Quantification</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D spatial map for human cancer cells is developed using the designed multiplexed THz metachip with superior Q factors and sensitivity. This method for screening and quantifying cancer cells based on such a 3D spatial map has been experimentally validated to achieve high accuracies (93.33%) under several selected cancer cells from different parts of the human body.








Abstract
In this paper, compact terahertz (THz) metachips for hyperspectral screening and quantitative evaluation of human cancer cells is reported. This pixelated resonant metachips feature the resonance channel from 1 and 3&#160;THz frequency with a record&#8208;high quality factor (up to 230). Through the interactions of various cancer cells of different concentrations, high&#8208;dimensional spectral signatures are obtained, which are further transformed into a spatial map for labelling and quantification purposes. The screening of up to 15 cancer cells is experimentally reported, with very high detecting accuracy of 93.33% and with attractive quantitative concentration sensitivity up to 1320&#160;kHz&#160;cell&#160;mL&#8722;1. This hyperspectral metachips are low&#8208;cost, highly compact, and label&#8208;free for fast, high&#8208;throughput and high&#8208;sensitivity detections and evaluation of human cancer cells. This technology does not require clinical experience, representing an accessible technology for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Bioinspired Nanoscale 3D Printing of Calcium Phosphates Using Bone Prenucleation Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a bone&#8208;bioinspired photoresin containing PNCs of calcium phosphates, enabling nanoscale precision via 2pp. This novel approach allows for 2D patterning and 3D nanostructuring of CaPs with intricate geometries. The technique offers unparalleled control over scaffold design and porosity, paving the way for advanced applications in bone tissue engineering and regenerative medicine.








Abstract
Calcium phosphates (CaPs) are ubiquitous in biological structures, such as vertebrate bones and teeth, and have been widely used in biomedical applications. However, fabricating CaPs at the nanoscale in 3D has remained a significant challenge, particularly due to limitations in current nanofabrication techniques, such as two&#8208;photon polymerization (2pp), which are not applicable for creating CaP nanostructures. In this study, a novel approach is presented to 3D print CaP structures with unprecedented resolution of &#8776;300&#160;nm precision, achieving a level of detail three orders of magnitude finer than any existing additive manufacturing techniques for CaPs. This advancement is achieved by leveraging bioinspired chemistry, utilizing bone prenucleation nanoclusters (PNCs, average size of 5&#160;nm), within a photosensitive resin. These nanoclusters form a highly transparent photoresist, overcoming the light&#8208;scattering typically associated with larger calcium phosphate&#8208;based nanoparticles. This method not only allows for nanopatterning of CaPs on diverse substrates, but also enables the precise control of microstructure down to the level of submicron grains. The method paves the way for the developing of bioinspired metamaterials, lightweight damage&#8208;tolerant materials, cell&#8208;modulating interfaces, and precision&#8208;engineered coatings.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Responsive H2S Composite System Regulates the Nerve Regeneration Microenvironment Through Multiple Pathways</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article designs and prepares a photo&#8208;responsive H2S composite nerve transplantation conduit using electrospinning technology and drug delivery system, combining aligned structure, RGD peptide, H2S, and Zn&#8208;CA MOFs. This system can not only achieve artificially controlled H2S release, but also slowly release Zn2+, achieving the joint regulation of Zn2+ and H2S in the nerve regeneration microenvironment.








Abstract
After injury, the imbalance of the regeneration microenvironment caused by inflammation, oxidative stress, insufficient neurovascularization, and inadequate energy supply affects nerve regeneration. Drug&#8208;delivery nerve conduits play a role in repairing the regenerative microenvironment. However, traditional drugs often fail to cross the blood&#8208;nerve barrier and lack multifunctionality, limiting the effectiveness of conduit therapy. Therefore, it is necessary to construct a multifunctional conduit that regulate the regeneration microenvironment timely and effectively. Herein, a photo&#8208;responsive hydrogen sulfide (H2S) composite nerve conduit, artificially controlled H2S release, is developed. A new structure of zinc&#8208;citric acid organic metal framework (Zn&#8208;CA MOFs) is utilized to improve its drug loading rate, achieving the joint regulation of the nerve regeneration microenvironment by H2S and Zn2+. In addition, RGD modification of polyester amide (P(CL&#8208;MMD&#8208;MAC)&#8208;RGD)) combined with aligned structure is used to improve the performance of the conduit. Relevant results demonstrate that H2S and Zn2+ can regulate inflammatory response and oxidative stress and promote mitochondrial function recovery and angiogenesis. Furthermore, the aligned structure can promote cell adhesion and guide cell directed migration. Overall, this study provides a method of combining gas neurotransmitters with ions to improve the nerve regeneration microenvironment, accelerate nerve regeneration, and restore motor function.

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Adhesives with Debonding&#8208;On&#8208;Demand Capability: Leveraging Responsive Microcapsules for Mechanically&#8208;Induced Debonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.








Abstract
Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high&#8208;value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding&#8208;on&#8208;demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate&#8208;filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite.

&lt;p&gt;Debondable adhesives hold promise for advancing sustainable bonding solutions, yet their adoption is often constrained by synthetic challenges that limit practicality and scalability. This study demonstrates how encapsulated plasticizers can impart mechanically triggered debonding-on-demand functionality to commercial adhesives. By offering a straightforward, adaptable approach, it advances the development of more sustainable, versatile adhesives with enhanced debonding capabilities.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Temporary adhesives capable of forming strong yet easily reversible bonds are garnering significant interest as sustainable materials that facilitate the recycling and recovery of high-value components. Herein is presented a comprehensive design and parameterization framework for developing effective temporary adhesives with mechanically induced debonding-on-demand capabilities. This framework is achieved by incorporating hexyl acetate-filled microcapsules into commercial polyvinyl acetate adhesives, creating a responsive adhesive composite. Under controlled compression, these microcapsules rupture precisely, releasing their contents to induce sufficient adhesive plasticization to enable effortless debonding. Our results indicate that while the inclusion of microcapsules affects adhesion strength and toughness, the overall mechanical performance remains stable across different concentrations. Thermal tests highlight a 50&#160;wt.% microcapsule concentration as optimal for enhanced plasticization, while compression tests show that an applied force of 5&#160;kN achieves maximum capsule rupture without compromising substrate integrity. Ultimately, specimens bonded with the responsive composite under compression exhibit a striking 1200% increase in creep rates compared to those bonded with the neat adhesive, allowing for effective debonding-on-demand&#8212;an outcome unattainable with the neat adhesive.

         <title>Engineered MSCs Break Endothelial&#8208;Myofibroblast Crosstalk in Pulmonary Fibrosis: Reconstructing the Vascular Niche</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The engineered MSCs (MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN) prepared based on surface&#8208;anchoring nanoparticle technology can trigger the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP&#8208;2) response to release drug&#8208;loaded nanoparticles (MM@LPHN) and break the malignant regulatory network between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells in the fibroblastic foci. Combined with the pro&#8208;angiogenic effect of MSCs achieve the reconstruction of the vascular niche, the engineered MSCs promote lung tissue regeneration and treat pulmonary fibrosis.








Abstract
In the progress of pulmonary fibrosis (PF), the normal vascular niche plays a crucial role in alveolar regeneration by secreting angiocrine factors. However, the malignant interaction between myofibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells results in significant loss of pulmonary capillaries in fibroblast foci, which promotes continuous deterioration of fibrosis. Herein, an engineered mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapeutic named MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN is developed for reconstructing the vascular niche, which is formed by modifying the surface of MSC with ROS&#8208;responsive lipid polymeric hybrid nanoparticles encapsulating the metformin and macitentan. Due to the homing ability of MSC, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN can effectively target lung tissue, then induce myofibroblast dedifferentiation to reduce the secretion of cytokines that cause endothelial cell damage and preventing endothelial cells from turning into a fibrotic phenotype, leading to recovery of the vascular endothelial cells function. Combined with the role of MSC&#8208;secreted growth factors promoting angiogenesis, the MSC&#8208;MM@LPHN ultimately constructs normal vascular structure in the fibroblast area and reverses bleomycin&#8208;induced PF. The findings suggest targeting the cell network in the vascular niche can effectively treat PF, which provides a novel therapeutic strategy for fibrosis&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Development of Bioorthogonally Degradable Tough Hydrogels Using Enamine N&#8208;Oxide Based Crosslinkers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inducibly degradable enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are integrated into tough double network hydrogels, enabling rapid and bioorthogonal degradation by aqueous diboron solutions. These chemical reagent&#8208;responsive biomaterials maintain structural integrity during use while enabling rapid degradation when needed, making them ideal for applications in intraoral wound dressings. These findings highlight the potential of the enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinker in polymer and materials chemistry.








Abstract
Inducibly degradable polymers present new opportunities to integrate tough hydrogels into a wide range of biomaterials. Rapid and inducible degradation enables fast transition in material properties without sacrificing material integrity prior to removal. In pursuit of bioorthogonal chemical modalities that will enable inducible polymer degradation in biologically relevant environments, enamine N&#8208;oxide crosslinkers are developed for double network acrylamide&#8208;based polymer/alginate hydrogels. Bioorthogonal dissociation initiated by the application of aqueous diboron solution through several delivery mechanisms effectively lead to polymer degradation. Their degradation by aqueous B2(OH)4 solution results in a fracture energy half&#8208;life of &lt;10 min. The biocompatibility of the degradable hydrogels and B2(OH)4 reagent is assessed, and the removability of strongly adhered tough hydrogels on mice skin is evaluated. Thermoresponsive PNiPAAm/Alg hydrogels are fabricated and application of the hydrogels as a chemically inducible degradable intraoral wound dressing is demonstrated. It is demonstrated through in vivo maximum tolerated dose studies that diboron solution administered to mice by oral gavage is well tolerated. Successful integration of enamine N&#8208;oxides within the tough double network hydrogels as chemically degradable motifs demonstrates the applicability of enamine N&#8208;oxides in the realm of polymer chemistry and highlights the importance of chemically induced bioorthogonal dissociation reactions for materials science.

         <title>Red, Green and Blue Liquid&#8208;Film Lasers Based on Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) in liquid films achieve breakthrough vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers across red, green, and blue spectra. By leveraging entropic ligands for ultrahigh solubility and integrating microfluidic cooling, this work overcomes thermal quenching, enabling stable lasing at MHz repetition rates. The platform unlocks customizable, solution&#8208;processed lasers for tunable wavelengths and diverse applications.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (cQD) are heralded for their tunable bandgaps, solution&#8208;processibility, and cost&#8208;effectiveness, making them ideal candidates for lasing applications. However, previous cQD lasing demonstrations have largely depended on close&#8208;packed solid&#8208;state films, which are deemed essential to counteract the rapid decay of material gain. In this study, a novel approach is introduced utilizing &#8220;entropic ligands and solvent&#8221; to enhance the solubility of cQDs in solution. By achieving the necessary critical volume fraction for lasing, this strategy leads to the groundbreaking development of the first liquid&#8208;state vertical&#8208;cavity surface&#8208;emitting lasers (VCSELs) based on cQDs across the blue and green spectrum, encompassing diverse material systems such as CdSe&#8208;based and InP&#8208;based cQDs. Furthermore, by integrating the liquid&#8208;state VCSEL with a microfluidic channel, it is demonstrated that heat dissipation during intense excitation is pivotal for cQD lasing likely across various excitation modes&#8212;whether pulsed or continuous&#8208;wave, optically or electrically&#8208;pumped&#8212;and different media, including liquid and solid states. The research will lay the foundation for a new era of liquid&#8208;state cQD lasers for specific occasions, distinguished by their customizable and largely&#8208;variable wavelengths, compact form factors, diverse materials basis, and dependable performance.

         <title>Nanoporous Ag Microparticles with Tailorable and Noncontaminated Nanopores for SERS Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &amp;lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &amp;gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

         <title>Lipoic Acid/Choline Ionic Liquid Enhanced Intratumoral Heat/Mass Transfer for Suppressing Thermo&#8208;Mediated Tumor Relapse and Metastasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid consisting of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) as a multifunctional thermal ablation sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA disrupts tumor matrix and modulates cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thus facilitating its heat/mass transfer in tumors. Meanwhile, LACH/PNA demonstrates specific cytotoxicity on hepatoma cells and is further intensified by thermal treatment.








Abstract
Thermal ablation (TA) is widely used for clinical treatment of various cancers. However, TA often struggles to efficiently kill tumor cells without injuring adjacent normal tissues/cells, leading to thermo&#8208;mediated tumor relapse and metastasis, owing to the immunosuppressive microenvironment surrounding residual tumor cells. In this study, a temperature&#8208;sensitive ionic liquid composed of lipoic acid and choline (LACH/PNA) is developed as a multifunctional TA sensitizer to suppress tumor metastasis induced by incomplete microwave ablation. LACH/PNA exhibits a high diffusion coefficient by disrupting the tumor matrix and modulating cancer&#8208;associated fibroblasts, thereby facilitating heat and mass transfer in tumors. LACH/PNA demonstrates greater cytotoxicity toward hepatoma cells than on normal hepatocytes with this effect further intensified by thermal treatment. These findings highlight LACH/PNA as a promising multifunctional sensitizer for clinical chemoablation&#8208;microwave ablation synergy.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

         <title>Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid&#8208;Based Archival File System for Random Accessible In Vivo DNA Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficient storage and retrieval of DNA (Deoxyribonucleic Acid) data while maintaining scalability and stability remain challenges in the field of molecular data storage. This study introduces Engineered Living Memory Microspheroids (ELMMs), which combine genetically modified microorganisms (GMMs) with matrix materials for DNA storage. The ELMM system improves random access and reduces data encapsulation time, offering scalable, closed&#8208;loop storage and reuse.








Abstract
Given its exceptional durability and high information density, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#160;has the potential to meet the escalating global demand for data storage if it can be stored efficiently and accessed randomly in exabyte&#8208;to&#8208;yottabyte&#8208;scale databases. Here, this work introduces the Engineered Living Memory Microspheroid (ELMM) as a novel material for DNA data storage, retrieval, and management. This work engineers a plasmid library and devises a random access strategy pairing plasmid function with DNA data in a key&#8208;value format. Each DNA segment is integrated with its corresponding plasmid, introduced into bacteria, and encapsulated within matrix material via droplet microfluidics within 5 min. ELMMs can be stored at room temperature following lyophilization and, upon rehydration, each type of ELMM exhibits specific functions expressed by the plasmids, allowing for physical differentiation based on these characteristics. This work demonstrates fluorescent expression as the plasmid function and employs fluorescence&#8208;based sorting access image files in a prototype database. By utilizing N optical channels, to retrieve 2N file types, each with a minimum of 10 copies. ELMM offers a digital&#8208;to&#8208;biological information solution, ensuring the preservation, access, replication, and management of files within large&#8208;scale DNA databases.

         <title>M&#246;bius Solvation Structure for Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc&#8208;ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.








Abstract
Zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low&#8208;temperature performance. Herein, water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first&#8208;ever pioneered, forming the surfactant&#8208;free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water&#8208;in&#8208;oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non&#8208;polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity&#8208;reversed encapsulation.

&lt;p&gt;Herein, in a bold departure from convention, the Ouzo effect is pioneeringly utilized to design surfactant-free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE), creating the first application of water-in-oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation in zinc-ion batteries. This approach enables dual regulation of both the solvent environment and the solvation structure, thereby enhancing battery performance.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc-ion batteries (ZIBs) have promising prospects in energy storage field, but the water molecules in aqueous electrolytes significantly compromise the stability of the anode and cathode interfaces and hinder the low-temperature performance. Herein, water-in-oil type M&#246;bius polarity topological solvation composed of oil, water, and amphiphilic salt are first-ever pioneered, forming the surfactant-free microemulsion electrolyte (SFMEE). This water-in-oil type M&#246;bius solvation structure, characterized by its distinct inner and outer layers and a polarity inversion feature, successfully connects the non-polar phase with the polar phase, eliminating the need for surfactants to reduce costs and system complexity. The amphiphilic anion of salt creates a polarity singularity and stabilizes the polarity-reversed encapsulation. The outer oil layer disrupts the cohesive polarity network of water and constructs a polarity-reversed cage to restrict water. A series of SFMEE combinations are investigated and then directly applied to ZIBs, confirming excellent universality and durability of this design. The Zn||NVO (NaV&#8323;O&#8328;&#183;1.5H&#8322;O) cells using SFMEE can stably cycle for 4000 cycles with a capacity of 125 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 86.8% capacity retention. This discovery of M&#246;bius solvation structure unlock unprecedented levels of electrolyte design and illuminate the development of next-generation high-performance energy storage systems.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

         <title>Thermal Processing Creates Water&#8208;Stable PEDOT:PSS Films for Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Instead of using chemical cross&#8211;linkers, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films for bioelectronics become water&#8208;stable after a simple heat treatment. The heat treatment is compatible with a range of rigid and elastomeric substrates and films are stable in vivo for &gt;20 days. 2D and 3D PEDOT:PSS structures can be patterned by delivering heat with a focused femtosecond laser.









Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors have emerged as a key material for the development of bioelectronic devices due to their soft mechanical properties, biocompatibility, and high volumetric capacitance. In particular, PEDOT:PSS has become a choice material because it is highly conductive, easily processible, and commercially available. However, PEDOT:PSS is dispersible in water, leading to delamination of films when exposed to biological environments. For this reason, chemical cross&#8211;linking agents such as (3&#8208;glycidyloxypropyl)trimethoxysilane (GOPS) are used to stabilize PEDOT:PSS films in water, but at the cost of decreased electrical performance. Here, it is shown that PEDOT:PSS thin films become water&#8208;stable by simply baking at high temperatures (&gt;150 &#176;C) for a short time (&#8776; 2 min). It is shown that heat&#8208;treated PEDOT:PSS films are as stable as their chemically&#8208;cross&#8211;linked counterparts, with their performance maintained for &gt;20 days both in vitro and in vivo. The heat&#8208;treated films eliminate electrically insulating cross&#8211;linkers, resulting in a 3&#215; increase in volumetric capacitance. Applying thermal energy using a focused femtosecond laser enables direct patterning of 3D PEDOT:PSS microstructures. The thermal treatment method is compatible with a wide range of substrates and is readily substituted into existing workflows for manufacturing devices, enabling its rapid adoption in the field of bioelectronics.

         <title>Generating Self&#8208;Adjuvated Nanofiber Vaccines by Coating Bacterial Flagella with Antigens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum&#8208;based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen&#8208;presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.








Abstract
Bacteria&#8208;based vaccines have received increasing attention given the ability to induce strong systemic immune responses. However, the application of bacteria as therapeutic agents inevitably suffers from infection&#8208;associated side effects due to the living characteristics. Here, the use of bacteria&#8208;derived flagella is described to construct self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. With the help of charge&#8208;reversal mediated by decoration with cationic polymers, the flagella can be coated with negatively charged antigens through electrostatic interaction. By virtue of the large aspect ratio, the resulting nanofiber vaccines show prolonged retention at the injection site and increased uptake by dendritic cells and macrophages. Thanks to the innate immunogenicity, self&#8208;adjuvated flagella robustly promote dendritic cell maturation and macrophage polarization, resulting in the elicitation of antigen&#8208;specific T&#8208;cell and B&#8208;cell immune responses. In ovalbumin&#8208;overexpressing melanoma&#8208;bearing mice, immunization with ovalbumin&#8208;carried vaccines not only exhibits a favorable tolerance, but also displays superior inhibition efficacies on tumor growth and metastasis separately under the therapeutic and prophylactic settings. The flexibility of this approach is further demonstrated for vaccine fabrication by coating with the SARS&#8208;CoV&#8208;2 Spike protein S1 subunit. Bacterial flagella&#8208;based self&#8208;adjuvated nanofiber platform proposes a versatile strategy to develop various vaccines for disease prevention and treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Coating bacterial flagella with antigens is used as a versatile platform for developing self-adjuvated nanofiber vaccines. The resulting flagellum-based subunit vaccines with appealing features in prolonging tumor retention, recruiting adequate immune cells, and promoting cellular uptake of antigens and subsequent activation of antigen-presenting cells provide a unique paradigm for effective vaccination.

         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Friction Memory Ionogels With Hysteretic Sticky&#8208;Slippery Transition via Thermolocking the Metastable state</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Owing to the kinetic differences between the evolution of the condensed structure in the bulk and the adsorption of droplets on the surface, on&#8208;demand friction memory is achieved without persistent stimulus.








Abstract
Many biological organisms possess adaptive friction states and display hysteretic friction recovery, allowing them to achieve specific friction memory after environment change. However, current artificial materials have limitations in maintaining on&#8208;demand friction states upon withdrawal of external triggers due to their strong dependence on external stimulus. Here, thermally induced phase separation ionogels with friction memory are reported. The kinetic difference between the evolution of bulk condensed structure and the adsorption of surface droplets after removing external stimulus delayed the recovery of friction state transition from slippery to sticky, thus achieving responsive friction memory. In addition, the metastable intermediate state generated during phase separation could be locked through vitrification, resulting in three distinct friction states determined by the synergy of stiffness and surface properties, including sticky state (coefficient of friction of 1.8), medium state (0.3&#8211;0.5) and slippery state (0.03&#8211;0.07). As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, smart devices with diverse surface friction performance are engineered to realize various functions, including recognition of thermal range for target objects, de&#8208;icing, and movement manipulation. These results provide new insights for expanding the applications of ionogels in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art soft robotics and haptic engineering, offering fresh perspectives for further development of these fields.

         <title>Giant and Anisotropic Enhancement of Spin&#8208;Charge Conversion in Graphene&#8208;Based Quantum System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
New magnetic Fe/Graphene/Pt double Rashba interface displays record spin&#8208;charge current interconversion efficiency at room temperature. The effect, which is anisotropic along the &#915;&#8208;K and &#915;&#8208;M directions, arises from the Direct and Inverse Edelstein mechanism in this new quantum epitaxial heterostructure.








Abstract
The ever&#8208;increasing demand for efficient data storage and processing has fueled the search for novel memory devices. By exploiting the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion phenomena, spintronics promises faster and low power solutions alternative to conventional electronics. In this work, a remarkable 34&#8208;fold increase in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge current conversion is demonstrated when incorporating a 2D epitaxial graphene monolayer between iron and platinum layers by exploring spin&#8208;pumping on&#8208;chip devices. Furthermore, it is found that the spin conversion is also anisotropic. This enhancement and anisotropy is attributed to the asymmetric Rashba contributions driven by an unbalanced spin accumulation at the differently hybridized top and bottom graphene interfaces, as highlighted by ad&#8208;hoc first&#8208;principles theory. The improvement in spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion as well as its anisotropy reveals the importance of interfaces in hybrid 2D&#8208;thin film systems, opening up new possibilities for engineering spin conversion in 2D materials, leading to potential advances in memory, logic applications, or unconventional&#160;computing.

         <title>Triazine&#8208;containing Covalent Organic Polymer&#8208;derived Grid&#8208;Like Multilocular Spheres for Aqueous Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grid&#8208;like multilocular sphere derived from a TCOP electrode with abundant redox active sites and a unique structure has been developed via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, resulting in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1). It enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675 Wh kg&#8722;1 in KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4 electrolyte.








Abstract
Triazine&#8208;containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid&#8208;like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist&#8208;induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as&#8208;fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1) and enables the as&#8208;assembled supercapacitor with an ultra&#8208;high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 in redox&#8208;active electrolyte (KI&#8208;mixed H2SO4), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro&#8208;activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox&#8208;active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application&#8208;inspired cutting&#8208;edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.

It enables the as-assembled supercapacitor with an ultra-high energy density of 675 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in KI-mixed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; electrolyte.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Triazine-containing covalent organic polymers (TCOPs) with unique structures and physicochemical properties are of great potential in energy storage and conversion applications, yet how to finely tune the morphology, and the accessible active sites, and to enhance capacitive activity remains a challenge. Here, the grid-like multilocular spheres derived from TCOP with abundant redox active sites and unique structures are fabricated via a molecular twist-induced regulation strategy, of which the number and size of cavities can be finely modulated by changing the conformers of the twisted unit and the Ostwald ripening time. The unique structure of the as-fabricated TCOP results in unprecedented high specific capacitance (8412 F g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at 1 A g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and enables the as-assembled supercapacitor with an ultra-high energy density of 675&#160;Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in redox-active electrolyte (KI-mixed H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), much better than all reported aqueous supercapacitors thus far. It is found that the high electro-activity is due to the synergistic effect of the enhanced accessibility of active sites and the enhanced interaction of the abundant active sites with the redox-active electrolytes. This approach may pave a new way to precise synthesis of COPs with tuned structure and properties for application-inspired cutting-edge electrochemical energy storage and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Manipulating Sodium Ion Gradient&#8208;Based Endogenic Electrical Stimulation Dressing for Wound Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study innovatively developed a dressing that can self&#8208;manipulate sodium ion gradient to achieve endogenic electrical stimulation of the wound in a non&#8208;invasive and passive manner, which can avoid the occurrence of side effects such as electrode occupancy, electrochemical, and thermal effects of exogenous electrical stimulation, and makes significant breakthroughs in wound repair and scar prevention.








Abstract
Endogenous electric field (EF) originating from differences in&#160;ionic gradients plays a decisive role in the wound healing process. Based on this understanding, a self&#8208;manipulating sodium ion gradient&#8208;based endogenic electrical stimulation dressing (smig&#8208;EESD) is developed to achieve passive, non&#8208;invasive, endogenic electrical stimulation of wounds, which avoids the side effects of electrode occupancy, electrochemical reactions, and thermal effects present in traditional exogenous electrical stimulation. smig&#8208;EESD reduced the potential at the center of the wound by specifically absorbing Na+ in the exudate, ultimately strengthening the wound endogenous EF. Importantly, smig&#8208;EESD converted the active transport dependent on Na+/K+&#8208;ATPase into passive diffusion by adsorbing extracellular matrix Na+, and the saved ATP consumption promoted tissue repair process. smig&#8208;EESD regulated innate and adaptive immune responses by upregulating the secretion of multiple cytokines, thereby suppressing injury&#8208;associated inflammatory responses and reducing scar formation. smig&#8208;EESD reveals an endogenic electrical stimulation strategy that is independent of electrodes and circuits, and provides new insights into the future development of electronic medicine.

         <title>Bionic Olfactory Neuron with In&#8208;Sensor Reservoir Computing for Intelligent Gas Recognition</title>

A material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy integrates an OFET array with in&#8208;sensor RC and KNN algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs.








Abstract
Gas sensing and recognition are closely related to the sustainable development of human society, current electronic noses (e&#8208;noses) typically focus on detecting specific gases, with only a few capable of recognizing complex odor mixtures. Further, these sensors often struggle to distinguish between isomers and homologs, as these compounds usually have similar physical and chemical properties, yielding nearly identical sensor responses. Even the mammalian olfactory systems consisting of a large variety of receptor cells and efficient neuron networks sometimes fail in this task. The bottleneck stems from the inability to extract the fingerprints of these compounds and the inefficiency of signal processing. To address these limitations, a material&#8208;device&#8208;algorithm co&#8208;design strategy is proposed that integrates an organic field&#8208;effect transistor (OFET) array with in&#8208;sensor reservoir computing (RC) and the k&#8208;nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm. Organic semiconductors diversify responses to different gases, while RC efficiently extracts spatiotemporal features with lower training costs and reduced energy overhead. This synergy achieves 100% classification accuracy for eight gases and 99.04% accuracy for a library of 26 gases, including mixtures, isomers, and homologs&#8212;among the highest reported accuracies. This work provides a groundbreaking hardware solution for bionic olfactory neurons with edge artificial intelligence (AI) functions, surpassing traditional e&#8208;noses.

         <title>Restrictive Heterointerfacial Delamination in Flexible Perovskite Photovoltaics Using a Bifacial Linker</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiple functional groups of potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K) are employed as a bifacial linker to improve adhesion and stability in flexible perovskite solar modules. BnBF3K enhances efficiency to 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) at an area of 12.80 cm2 with excellent mechanical flexibility, maintaining 96.56% of initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles.








Abstract
Flexible perovskite solar cells offer significant potential for portable electronics due to their exceptional power density. However, the commercialization of these devices is hampered by challenges related to mechanical flexibility, primarily due to inadequate adhesion between the perovskite absorber layer and the flexible substrate. Herein, this delamination issue is addressed by employing a bifacial linker, potassium benzyl(trifluoro)borate (BnBF3K), to enhance adhesion at the SnO2/perovskite interface. This approach not only improves the mechanical stability of flexible perovskite devices but also reduces buried surface defects and optimizes energy level alignment. Consequently, a record efficiency of 21.82% (certified at 21.39%) is achieved for a flexible perovskite solar module with an area of 12.80&#160;cm2 and a high efficiency of 24.15% for a flexible perovskite solar cell. Furthermore, the flexible modules exhibit outstanding mechanical flexibility, retaining 96.56% of their initial efficiency after 6000 bending cycles, demonstrating their suitability for various practical applications.

         <title>A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;Loaded Boron Nanoparticle for Targeted Cancer Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A PD&#8208;L1 siRNA&#8208;loaded boron nanoparticle (10B/siPD&#8208;L1) is developed to synergize boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) with immunotherapy. Utilizing 10B/siPD&#8208;L1, BNCT can precisely kill tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells. Moreover, 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 inhibits intracellular PD&#8208;L1 expression, thereby not only amplifying the BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage but also maximizing T&#8208;cell activation, which significantly suppresses the growth of both primary and metastatic tumors.








Abstract
Although the combination of radiotherapy and immunotherapy is regarded as a promising clinical treatment strategy, numerous clinical trials have failed to demonstrate synergistic effects. One of the key reasons is that conventional radiotherapies inevitably damage intratumoral effector immune cells. Boron Neutron Capture Therapy (BNCT) is a precise radiotherapy that selectively kills tumor cells while sparing adjacent normal cells, by utilizing 10B agents and neutron irradiation. Therefore, combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy holds promise for achieving more effective synergistic effects. Here it develops a 10B&#8208;containing polymer that self&#8208;assembled with PD&#8208;L1 siRNA to form 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles for combinational BNCT&#8208;immunotherapy. Unlike antibodies, PD&#8208;L1 siRNA can inhibit intracellular PD&#8208;L1 upregulated by BNCT, activating T&#8208;cell immunity while also suppressing DNA repair. This can enhance BNCT&#8208;induced DNA damage, promoting immunogenic cell death (ICD) and further amplifying the antitumor immune effect. The results demonstrated that BNCT using 10B/siPD&#8208;L1 nanoparticles precisely killed tumor cells while sparing adjacent T cells and induced a potent antitumor immune response, inhibiting distal and metastatic tumors.

         <title>2D Biomimetic Membranes Constructed by Charge Assembly and Hydrogen Bonding for Precise Ion Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, 2D biomimetic membranes constructed via charge assembly and hydrogen bonding achieve precise ion separation with enhanced mechanical stability. Engineered bacteria act as functional spacers, maintaining selectivity while withstanding high pressures. The membranes exhibit near 100% UO22+ rejection and exceptional K/U and V/U selectivity, enabling sustainable uranium extraction from seawater.








Abstract
Designing well&#8208;ordered, multifunctional layered membranes with high selectivity and long&#8208;term stability remains a significant challenge. Here, a simple strategy is introduced that utilizes charge repulsion between graphene oxide (GO) and engineered bacteria to induce liquid crystal formation, enabling their layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer self&#8208;assembly on a polyethersulfone membrane. The interlayer pressure flattens the bacteria, removing interlayer water and forming a densely packed structure. This compression decreases the spacing between functional groups, leading to a robust hydrogen bonding network and a significant enhancement in mechanical properties (12.42 times tensile strength increase). Notably, the pressure preserves the activity of the super uranyl&#8208;binding protein of engineered bacteria, which selectively coordinates with uranyl (UO22+) through high&#8208;affinity coordination bonds, enabling recognition and sieving of target ions. The membrane demonstrates near 100% rejection of UO22+, K/U, and V/U selectivity of &#8776;140 and &#8776;40, respectively, while maintaining long&#8208;term stability. This strategy provides a versatile platform for the precise design of high&#8208;performance membranes, advancing the field of molecular transport in energy and environmental applications.

         <title>Rapid and Large&#8208;Scale Synthesis of High&#8208;Crystalline Imide Covalent Organic Frameworks Accelerated by Self&#8208;Generated Water</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile, rapid, scalable, and low&#8208;cost self&#8208;accelerated method to synthesize imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is developed. This synthetic method is performed under solvent&#8208;free and atmospheric pressure conditions. The in situ generated water during monomer condensation can significantly accelerate the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers to form highly crystalline imide COFs.








Abstract
Imide covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are considered promising materials in various fields due to their exceptional stability, large surface area, and high porosity. However, current synthesis methods of imide COFs typically involve complex vacuum operations, large amounts of solvents, and long reaction times at high temperatures, limiting their scalability for industrial production. Herein, a facile self&#8208;accelerated strategy is developed for rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale synthesis of eight imide COFs (SACOFs) under solvent&#8208;free, vacuum&#8208;free, and low&#8208;temperature conditions. Mechanistic studies reveal that the self&#8208;accelerated synthesis is driven by the self&#8208;generated water under atmospheric conditions, which accelerates the reversible self&#8208;healing of disordered polymers, ultimately leading to the rapid synthesis of highly crystalline COFs. Notably, the only additive required besides the COF monomers is o&#8208;substituted benzoic acid, a small amount of which is grafted onto the imide COFs, enabling their straightforward functionalization. Thiol&#8208;functionalized SACOFs are synthesized as supports for anchoring Pd nanoparticles. The as&#8208;prepared Pd@SACOFs exhibit high activity and selectivity in the hydrogenation of substituted nitrobenzene due to the surface modulation of Pd by thiol groups. The self&#8208;accelerated synthetic strategy enables rapid, low&#8208;cost, and large&#8208;scale production of imide COFs, potentially paving the way for their transition from laboratory research to commercial applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Electrocatalysts of Potassium Lactate Oxidation for Hydrogen and Solid Potassium Acetate Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Potassium lactate, produced from polylactic acid plastic waste, is oxidized to potassium acetate on an anode using Ni(Co)OOH as the electrocatalyst, while hydrogen is simultaneously generated at the cathode, through a highly efficient industrial&#8208;scale electrolysis system.








Abstract
With the increasing use of polylactic acid (PLA), more attention is turning to its post&#8208;treatment. Current methods such as natural decomposition, composting, and incineration are limited by significant carbon dioxide emissions and resource waste. Here, an efficient electrocatalytic conversion approach is presented to transform PLA waste into high&#8208;value chemicals, particularly potassium acetate (AA&#8208;K). By combining experimental and theoretical calculation, a high&#8208;performance catalyst Ni(Co)OOH is developed, which exhibits a current density of 403&#160;mA cm&#8315;2 at 1.40&#160;V (vs RHE) with 96% Faraday efficiency for AA&#8208;K in the electrooxidation of potassium lactate (LA&#8208;K, the product of PLA degradation in KOH). Through in situ spectroscopy techniques and density functional theory calculations, the structural regulation of the catalyst, and reaction pathways of the electrooxidation are elucidated. Further experiments demonstrate the superior catalytic performance of the Ni(Co)OOH catalyst in an industrial&#8208;scale tandem system. In 2 h of electrolysis, 320&#160;g of PLA waste produces 232 L of H&#8322;, yielding 1200&#160;g of AA&#8208;K with 97% purity after neutralization and drying. The system demonstrates high conversion efficiency (approaching 97%) for diverse real PLA waste forms, including powder, cups, fibers, and cloth. This research provides a scalable and sustainable approach for PLA waste upcycling.

         <title>Neural Network&#8208;Assisted End&#8208;to&#8208;End Design for Full Light Field Control of Meta&#8208;Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive system&#8208;level neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework of meta&#8208;optics for full light field control is presented. Performance enhancement over separated design is experimentally demonstrated in dual&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength holography. Functionality limitation breakthrough is experimentally demonstrated in orthogonal polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth multiplexing holography. Application potential is demonstrated in non&#8208;orthogonal polarization across wavelength channels for polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing.








Abstract
Meta&#8208;optics, with unique light&#8208;matter interactions and extensive design space, underpins versatile and compact optical devices through flexible multi&#8208;parameter light field control. However, conventional designs struggle with the intricate interdependencies of nano&#8208;structural complex responses across wavelengths and polarizations at a system level, hindering high&#8208;performance full&#8208;light field control. Here, a neural network&#8208;assisted end&#8208;to&#8208;end design framework that facilitates global, gradient&#8208;based optimization of multifunctional meta&#8208;optics layouts for full light field control is proposed. Its superiority over separated design is showcased by utilizing the limited design space for multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;polarization holography with enhanced performance (e.g., &#8776;6 &#215; structural similarity index experimentally). By harnessing the dispersive full&#8208;parameter Jones matrix, orthogonal tri&#8208;polarization multi&#8208;wavelength&#8208;depth holography is further demonstrated, breaking conventional channel limitations. To highlight its versatility, non&#8208;orthogonal polarizations (&gt;3) are showcased for arbitrary polarized&#8208;spectral multi&#8208;information processing applications in display, imaging, and computing. The comprehensive framework elevates light field control in meta&#8208;optics, delivering superior performance, enhanced functionality, and improved reliability, thereby paving the way for next&#8208;generation intelligent optical technologies.

Diluted heterojunctions are employed to increase the structure order in the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer fabricated solar cells and polymeric diluent is found superior that the small molecular diluent, creating OSC having dual fibrils with significantly increased absorption and reduced charge recombination to realize an efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%).








Abstract
As an exitonic photovoltaic device, organic solar cells (OSCs) consist of electron donating and accepting components in their photoactive layer, in which the molecular interactions between donor and acceptor can significantly affect the nanoscale morphology as well as the photovoltaic performance of OSCs. In this work, by diluting electron donor with electron acceptor having opposite electrostatic potentials to promote the structural order via strengthened intermolecular interactions, this study shows that polymeric diluent is more effective due to its long&#8208;ranged conjugated backbone compared with small molecular diluent. The ternary heterojunction made of C5&#8208;16:L8&#8208;BO binary acceptors diluted with D18 shows the strongest structural order, benefiting from the strong interactions between L8&#8208;BO and C5&#8208;16. The enhanced structural order within the photoactive layer prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition of the diluted p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type heterojunctions contributes to enhanced light absorption, improved charge transport, and inhibited charge recombination. As the result, OSC based on D18 (PY&#8208;IT diluted)/L8&#8208;BO:C5&#8208;16 (D18 diluted) having donor and acceptor dual fibrils obtains an unprecedented power conversion efficiency of 21.0% (certified value of 20.25%), which is one of the highest certified PCE up to date.

         <title>Stochastically Broken Inversion Symmetry of Van der Waals Topological Insulator for Nanoscale Physically Unclonable Functions</title>

vdW Janus topological insulator is presented with stochastic inversion asymmetry via penetrative single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization, which enables the large&#8208;scale synthesis, one&#8208;step process, and low&#8208;temperature condition with back&#8208;end&#8208;of&#8208;line process compatibility. Sulfur dominance and its corresponding spatial OOP domain distribution are spatially observed using piezoelectric force microscopy&#160;hysteresis mapping, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, top&#8208;view scanning electroc microscopy, Kelvin probe force microscopy, and force&#8208;distance curve mapping. This provides an extendable synthetic solution for stochastic and size&#8208;controllable challenge&#8208;response pairs generation for PUFs application, which can overcome the conventional limitations of encryption technology.








Abstract
Owing to the exotic state of quantum matter, topological insulators have emerged as a significant platform for new&#8208;generation functional devices. Among these topological insulators, tetradymites have received significant attention because of their van der Waals (vdW) structures and inversion symmetries. Although this inversion symmetry completely blocks exotic quantum phenomena, it should be broken down to facilitate versatile topological functionalities. Recently, a Janus structure is suggested for asymmetric out&#8208;of&#8208;plane lattice structures, terminating the heterogeneous atoms at two sides of the vdW structure. However, the synthesis of Janus structures has not been achieved commercially because of the imprecise control of the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, high&#8208;temperature synthesis, and low yield. To overcome these limitations, plasma sulfurization of vdW topological insulators has been presented, enabling stochastic inversion asymmetry. To take practical advantage of the random lattice distortion, physically unclonable functions (PUFs) have been suggested as applications of vdW Janus topological insulators. The sulfur dominance is experimentally demonstrated via X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, hysteresis variation, cross&#8208;sectional transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion energy variation. In conclusion, it is envisioned that the vdW Janus topological insulators can provide an extendable encryption platform for randomized lattice distortion, offering on&#8208;demand stochastic inversion asymmetry via a single&#8208;step plasma sulfurization.

         <title>Two&#8208;Dimensional Cr3Te4/WS2/Fe3GeTe2/WTe2 Magnetic Memory with Field&#8208;Free Switching and Low Power Consumption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates novel magnetic tunnel junctions with low resistance&#8208;area product by integrating chemically vapor&#8208;deposited 2D Cr3Te4/WS2 heterostructures with 2D Fe3GeTe2 magnets. Leveraging spin&#8208;orbit torque to manipulate spins in Fe3GeTe2, the authors fabricate an energy&#8208;efficient magnetic memory device. This breakthrough not only advances high&#8208;performance spintronics but also paves the way for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) magnetic memory technology has garnered significant attention due to its ability to enable field&#8208;free switching of magnets with strong perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). However, concerns regarding power consumption of SOT&#8208;memory are persisting. Here, this work proposes a method to construct magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) by transferring chemically vapor&#8208;deposited two&#8208;dimensional (2D) Cr3Te4/WS2 van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures onto 2D Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) magnet. The robustness and tunability of 2D magnets allow MTJs to exhibit non&#8208;volatility, multiple output states, and impressive cycling durability. MTJs with thin WS2 barriers (fewer than six layers) exhibit a linear tunneling effect,&#160;achieving a low resistance&#8208;area product (RA) of 15.5 k&#937;&#183;&#181;m2 using bilayer WS2, which facilitats low&#8208;power operation. Furthermore, the different 2D magnets display a significant anti&#8208;parallel window of up to 8 kOe. SOT&#8208;memory based on the typical MTJ demonstrates a low write consumption of 0.3 mJ and read consumption of 9.7 nJ, marking a significant advancement in 2D vdW SOT&#8208;memory. This research has pointed out a new direction for constructing low power consumption SOT&#8208;memory with PMA field&#8208;free switching.

Ultrathin&#8208;conjugated MOFs nanosheets with single&#8208;crystalline characteristics are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. The &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked MOF/graphene van der Waals heterostructure can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. This preferable stacking exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties.








Abstract
2D conjugated metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted significant attention in various fields due to their outstanding characteristics. However, due to the strong interlayer &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking interactions, the preparation of high&#8208;quality and atomic&#8208;scale single&#8208;crystalline conjugated MOF structures continues to pose a significant challenge. The investigation of its nonlinear optical (NLO) property and application for ultrafast photonics is still rare. Herein, the ultrathin Cu3(HHTP)2 and Ni3(HHTP)2 (HHTP = 2,3,6,7,10,11&#8208;hexahydroxytriphenylene) nanosheets (CuHHTPNs and NiHHTPNs) with single&#8208;crystalline characteristic are prepared by surfactant&#8208;assisted solution synthesis strategy. Moreover, the &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacked CuHHTPNs(NiHHTPNs)/graphene van der Waals heterostructures (CuNsG&#8208;VHS and NiNsG&#8208;VHS) are achieved by ultrasound&#8208;assisted method. According to characterization analyses and theoretical simulations, this preferable stacking ultrathin van der Waals heterostructures exhibits superior &#960;&#8208;conjugated electron cloud extension, charge transfer, and NLO properties. Noticeably, the third&#8208;order NLO polarizability of CuNsG&#8208;VHS keeps in a relatively high level compared with the reported 2D saturable absorber materials in the near&#8208;infrared wavelength range. Based on these outstanding properties, CuNsG&#8208;VHS can serve as an excellent saturable absorber to achieve fundamental mode&#8208;locking with femtosecond pulse duration, and high&#8208;order harmonic mode&#8208;locking with GHz repetition frequency. These demonstrations provide a valuable strategy for the development of promising conjugated MOFs for ultrafast photonics and advanced optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Rhodamine B&#8208;Derived Low&#8208;Toxicity Full&#8208;Color Carbon Dots with Wide Tunable High&#8208;Stable Liquid&#8208;State Lasers</title>

         <dc:description>
Full&#8208;color carbon dots (FCDs) with emission wavelengths ranging from 434 to 703&#160;nm are synthesized using Rhodamine B (RhB) as the sole precursor. The photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs) and gain performance of the FCDs are enhanced due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Tunable liquid&#8208;state laser emissions in green, yellow, red, and NIR regions are achieved with lower laser thresholds compared to RhB, demonstrating superior laser stability. Additionally, these FCDs are validated as excellent laser sources. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirmed that FCDs exhibit significantly lower toxicity and superior staining effects compared to RhB.








Abstract
Carbon dots (CDs) serve as a novel, non&#8208;toxic, cost&#8208;effective, and highly&#8208;stable solution&#8208;processable nanolaser material. However, compared to commonly used commercial laser dyes, CDs exhibit lower photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQYs), radiation transition rates, and gain coefficients. Consequently, this leads to higher laser thresholds that significantly impede the expansion of practical applications for CDs. Therefore, enhancing the gain performance of CDs is crucial in guiding the design of CD gain materials and promoting their practical applications. Herein, Rhodamine B (RhB) is employed as a sole precursor for the synthesis of full&#8208;color CDs (FCDs) with vibrant blue, green, yellow, red, and NIR (denoted as B&#8208;CDs, G&#8208;CDs, Y&#8208;CDs, R&#8208;CDs, and NIR&#8208;CDs) fluorescence through cross&#8208;linking, polymerization, and carbonization processes. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra ranged from 434 to 703&#160;nm. Notably, the PLQYs and gain performance of FCDs are improved due to cross&#8208;linked enhanced emission (CEE) effects. Green, yellow, red, and NIR laser emission is achieved with lower laser thresholds and exhibited superior laser stabilities than RhB. Furthermore, cytotoxicity tests confirm that FCDs possess significantly lower toxicity than RhB. This study not only validates the applicability of CEE in CDs for developing multicolor gain materials but also advances the practical application of miniaturized lasers based on CDs.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Polarization Convolution Based on Ferroelectric&#8208;Reconfigurable Polarization&#8208;Sensitive Photodiodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferroelectric BiFeO3 nanowire photodiodes enable in&#8208;sensor polarization extraction through aligned nanowire&#8208;induced anisotropic photoresponse and reconfigurable photovoltaic effects. With two&#8208;order anisotropic ratio tunability, the devices perform polarization&#8208;based convolutions, boosting object recognition accuracy to 89.6% in adverse weather conditions. This innovation advances intelligent vision systems with efficient in&#8208;sensor polarization processing.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing can enhance the imaging system performance by putting part of the computations into the sensor. While substantial advancements have been made in latency, spectral range, and functionalities, the strategy for in&#8208;sensor light polarization computing has remained unexplored. Here, it is shown that ferroelectric&#8208;reconfigurable polarization&#8208;sensitive photodiodes (FPPDs) based on BiFeO3 nanowire arrays can perform in&#8208;sensor computations on polarization information. This innovation leverages the anisotropic photoresponse from the 1D structure of nanowires and the non&#8208;volatile reconfigurability of ferroelectrics. The devices show programmable anisotropic ratios as high as 5219, surpassing most state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetectors and commercial polarization image sensors. Employing tunable photoresponse as kernel, FPPDs can perform convolutions to directly extract feature maps containing polarization information, which raises the recognition accuracy on road&#8208;scene objects under adverse weather up to 89.6%. The research highlights the potential of FPPDs as a highly efficient vision sensor and extends the boundaries of advanced intelligent imaging systems.

         <title>The Critical Role of Atomic&#8208;Scale Polarization in Transition Metal Oxides on Vanadium&#8208;Redox Electrochemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals for the first time the underlying mechanism of vacancies in TOMEs and uncovers the effect of atomic&#8208;scale polarization on the redox reaction mechanism through in situ Raman and operando ATR&#8208;SEIRAS. Further, the stability of cation/anion vacancies is explored in long&#8208;term cycling. The findings standardize the fundamentals governing the utility and evolution of vacancies, thereby opening new avenues for a variety of sustainable energy storage schemes.








Abstract
Transition metal oxide electrocatalysts (TMOEs) are poised to revive grid&#8208;scale all&#8208;vanadium redox flow batteries (VRFBs) due to their low&#8208;cost and unique electronic properties, while often inescapably harboring surface vacancies. The role of local vacancy&#8208;induced physicochemical properties on vanadium&#8208;redox electrochemistry (VRE), encompassing kinetics, and stability, remains profoundly unveiled. Herein, for the first time, it is revealed that vacancies induce atomic&#8208;scale polarization in TMOEs and elucidate its mechanism in VRE. Attributable to local polarization, particularly by cation vacancy, the activated nearest&#8208;coordinated Mn sites prominently augment the adsorption competence of the V2+/V3+ couple and expedite its round&#8208;tripping by forming an intermediate *Mn&#8211;O&#8211;V bridge. It is also affirmed that the anion vacancies are vulnerable to microstructure reconfiguration by feeble hydroxyl adsorption and thus performance degradation over long&#8208;term cycling, in contrast to cation vacancies. Accordingly, the VRFB employing cation&#8208;vacancy&#8208;functionalized electrode delivers an energy efficiency of 80.8% and a reliable 1000&#8208;cycle lifespan with a negligible decay of 0.57% per cycle at 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outclassing others. The findings shed light on the fundamental rules governing the utility and evolution of vacancies in TMOEs, thereby moving a step closer toward their deployment in a wide range of sustainable energy storage schemes.

         <title>Regulating the Isomerization Geometry and Energy State of Covalent Organic Frameworks for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A geometric isomerization strategy is reported to modulate the electron and energy states of metal&#8208;free COF&#8208;based catalysts via introducing bithiophene units featuring diverse substitutions. The asymmetric 2,3&#8208;substitution COFs with enhanced dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution show high electrocatalytic activity, with the pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms emerging as active sites.








Abstract
Embedding isomer entities onto crystalline frameworks with precisely defined spatial distributions represents a promising approach to enhancing the efficiency of oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in fuel cells. However, accurately constructing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to regulate energy state effectively remains a significant challenge. Herein, an innovative geometric isomerization strategy aimed at minimizing the rotational barrier energy (&#916;E), average local ionization energy (ALIE), and Gibbs free energy (&#916;G) for ORR within COFs is proposed. Based on this strategy, isomeric Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#945; with 2,2&#8208;substitution, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#946;&#946; with 3,3&#8208;substitution, and Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with 2,3&#8208;substitution on the mainchain frameworks have been obtained. The electronic states and intermediate adsorption capabilities are finely tuned through isomer modification, yielding a precisely controllable chemical activity. Notably, Py&#8208;COF&#8208;&#945;&#946; with lower &#916;E between thiophenes achieves remarkable performance, evidenced by a half&#8208;wave potential of 0.77 V vs reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE), surpassing most reported metal&#8208;free electrocatalysts. Combined with theoretical prediction and in situ Raman spectra, it is revealed that the increased dipole moment and non&#8208;uniform charge distribution caused by isomer endows pentacyclic&#8208;carbon (thiophene &#946;&#8208;position) far from sulfur atoms with efficient catalytic activity. This work has opened up a novel paradigm for the isomerization of COFs and underscores the pivotal role of charge regulation in facilitating efficient catalysis.

         <title>Etchless InSe Cavities Based on Bound States in the Continuum for Enhanced Exciton&#8208;Mediated Emission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An etchless bound&#8208;state&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum polymer cavity is designed on a 2D InSe flake, achieving an impressive photoluminescence enhancement of 218 times. The exciton&#8208;exciton scattering in InSe is intensively amplified on cavity, which is unobservable off&#8208;cavity. Second harmonic generation in InSe can also be significantly enhanced by 404 times. The etchless cavity concept can be extended to other nanostructures beyond grating.








Abstract
Recently, fervent research interest is sparked to indium selenide (&#947;&#8208;InSe) due to its dazzling optical and electronic properties. The direct bandgap in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) range ensures efficient carrier recombination in InSe, promoting impressive competency for lavish NIR applications. Nevertheless, the photoluminescence (PL) efficiency of InSe is significantly limited by out&#8208;of&#8208;plane (OP) excitons, adverse to practical devices. Herein, a facile and effective solution is proposed by introducing photonic bound&#8208;states&#8208;in&#8208;the&#8208;continuum (BIC) modes to enhance excitons in InSe through strengthened exciton&#8208;photon coupling. This cavity is constructed simply by patterning a polymer grating onto the InSe flake without an etching process, achieving an impressive PL enhancement of over 200 times. By adjusting the cavity resonance wavelength, it can selectively amplify the exciton emission or the exciton&#8208;exciton scattering process, which is not observable off&#8208;cavity at room temperature. Additionally, the second harmonic generation (SHG) process in InSe can also be largely enhanced by over 400 times on the cavity. Notably, the etchless cavity design can be further extended to other nanostructures beyond grating. This research presents a feasible and efficient approach to enhancing the optical performance of OP excitons, paving a prospective avenue for advanced linear and nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Mitochondrial Transplantation via Magnetically Responsive Artificial Cells Promotes Intracerebral Hemorrhage Recovery by Supporting Microglia Immunological Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A type of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) has been developed, demonstrating the loading of mitochondria and self&#8208;enclosure processes to ensure the protection of mitochondrial transport via the bloodstream. The treatment with ACs effectively transplanted mitochondria around the lesion, thereby improving neurological recovery by supporting microglia immunological homeostasis after intracerebral hemorrhage.








Abstract
The immune&#8208;inflammatory responses in the brain represent a key therapeutic target to ameliorate brain injury following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), where pro&#8208;inflammatory microglia and its mitochondrial dysfunction plays a pivotal role. Mitochondrial transplantation is a promising strategy to improve the cellular mitochondrial function and thus modulate their immune properties. However, the transplantation of naked mitochondria into the brain has been constrained by the peripheral clearance and the difficulty in achieving selective access to the brain. Here, a novel strategy for mitochondrial transplantation via intravenous injection of magnetically responsive artificial cells (ACs) are proposed. ACs can protect the loaded mitochondria and selectively accumulate around the lesion under an external magnetic field (EMF). In this study, mitochondria released from ACs can effectively improve microglial mitochondrial function, attenuate their pro&#8208;inflammatory attributes, and elevate the proportion of immunosuppressive microglia. In this way, microglia immune homeostasis in the brain is reestablished, and inflammation is attenuated, ultimately promoting functional recovery. This study presents an effective approach to transplant mitochondria into the brain, offering a promising alternative to modulate the immune&#8208;inflammatory cascade in the brain following ICH.

         <title>Electrocatalytic Hydrogenation Boosted by Surface Hydroxyls&#8208;Modulated Hydrogen Migration over Nonreducible Oxides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is considered to play a major role in ubiquitous technologies involving hydrogen. However, its application in Earth&#8208;abundant widely&#8208;used non&#8208;reducible oxides is severely limited by much shorter migration distances of atomic hydrogen compared to those in reducible oxides. This study presents a surface hydroxyl modulation strategy to enhance hydrogen migration over nonreducible oxides, promoting electrocatalytic hydrogenation for water purification.








Abstract
The migration of atomic hydrogen species over heterogeneous catalysts is deemed essential for hydrogenation reactions, a process closely related to the catalyst's functionalities. While surface hydroxyls&#8208;assisted hydrogen spillover is well documented on reducible oxide supports, its effect on widely&#8208;used nonreducible supports, especially in electrocatalytic reactions with water as the hydrogen source, remains a subject of debate. Herein, a nonreducible oxide&#8208;anchored copper single&#8208;atom catalyst (Cu1/SiO2) is designed and uncover that the surface hydroxyls on SiO2 can serve as efficient transport channels for hydrogen spillover, thereby enhancing the activated hydrogen coverage on the catalyst and favoring the hydrogenation reaction. Using electrocatalytic dechlorination as a model reaction, the Cu1/SiO2 catalyst delivers hydrodechlorination activity 42 times greater than that of commercial Pd/C. An integrated experimental and theoretical investigation elucidates that surface hydroxyls facilitate the spillover of hydrogen intermediates formed at the Cu sites, boosting the coverage of active hydrogen on the surface of the Cu1/SiO2. This work demonstrates the feasibility of surface hydroxyls acting as transport channels for hydrogen&#8208;species to boost hydrogen spillover on nonreducible oxide supports and paves the way for designing advanced selective hydrogenation electrocatalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Strength Gelatin Hydrogel Scaffold with Drug Loading Remodels the Inflammatory Microenvironment to Enhance Osteoporotic Bone Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength exceeding 10&#160;MPa is developed, combined with rapid photocross&#8208;linking capability. This hydrogel enables the fabrication of complex and precise scaffolds through 3D printing. When loaded with roxadustat, the scaffold facilitates sustained&#8208;release therapy, effectively remodeling inflammatory microenvironments. This approach presents a promising solution for the repair of osteoporotic bone defects.









Abstract
Osteoporosis is a widespread condition that induces an inflammatory microenvironment, limiting the effectiveness of conventional therapies and presenting significant challenges for bone defect repair. To address these issues, a high&#8208;strength gelatin hydrogel scaffold loaded with roxadustat is developed, specifically designed to remodel the inflammatory microenvironment and enhance osteoporotic bone regeneration. By incorporating minimal methacrylated hyaluronic acid (HAMA) into an o&#8208;nitrobenzyl functionalized gelatin (GelNB) matrix, a gelatin hydrogel with a fracture strength of 10&#160;MPa is achieved, providing exceptional structural stability and enabling precise scaffold fabrication through digital light processing (DLP) 3D printing. Validated through cell experiments and animal studies, the hydrogel scaffold supports cell adhesion and migration, offers excellent tissue compatibility, and is fully degradable, meeting the requirements of a therapeutic scaffold. Including roxadustat further enhances the scaffold's functionality by regulating the inflammatory microenvironment via hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) signaling, significantly improving bone defect repair in osteoporotic models. This drug&#8208;loaded scaffold effectively addresses inflammation&#8208;induced limitations and enhances the regenerative capacity of the affected area, paving the way for improved therapeutic outcomes in osteoporotic bone repair.

         <title>Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure&#8208;properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium&#8208;MCOF.








Abstract
Covalent and metal&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light&#8208;driven processes mainly due to their ligand&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge&#8208;separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal&#8208;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure&#8208;properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)2]2+ (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;&#8208;terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff&#8208;base MCOF.

     alt="Unravelling the Atomic Structure of a Metal-Covalent Organic Framework Assembled from Ruthenium Metalloligands"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) are novel porous materials that exhibit the advantages of covalent and metal-organic frameworks. However, it is extremely difficult to resolve their atomic structure and better understand their structure-properties relation. This work utilizes a synergistic combination of advanced microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods to unravel the atomic mapping of a photoactive ruthenium-MCOF.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Covalent and metal-organic frameworks (COFs and MOFs) have shown great promise in light-driven processes mainly due to their ligand-to-metal charge-separation properties, as well as having access to a diverse range of photoactive metalloligands and organic linkers. However, both frameworks present individual drawbacks that can potentially be avoided by combining both systems (metal and covalent) to produce metal-covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs), exhibiting the advantages of both material types. Yet, due to their poor crystallinity, the understanding of the structure-properties relation of MCOFs remains unclear. Herein, we report photoactive linkers in the form of a [Ru(tpy)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (tpy: 2,2&#8242;,6,2&#8243;-terpyridine) complex which covalently binds to a luminescent pyrene core to yield a new, photoactive Schiff-base MCOF. The structure, thermal, electronic, and optical properties of this novel material have been exhaustively characterized by a wide range of microscopy, spectroscopic, and computational methods. This combined experimental and computational work represents a significant step toward the fundamental understanding of the photoactive units within the framework, their hierarchical arrangement and interactions with substrates, which is essential for the future design of efficient photocatalytic materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Magnetointeractive Cr2Te3&#8208;Coated Liquid Metal Droplets for Flexible Memory Arrays and Wearable Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel strategy for coating liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials. The fabricated chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, nonadhesion to surfaces, and cost&#8208;effective recyclability. Their functionality is demonstrated in magnetointeractive memory devices and wearable sensors for dynamic gesture recognition, broadening the potential applications of flexible electronics.








Abstract
Magnetic liquid metal droplets, featured by unique fluidity, metallic conductivity, and magnetic reactivity, are of growing significance for next&#8208;generation flexible electronics. Conventional fabrication routes, which typically incorporate magnetic nanoparticles into liquid metals, otherwise encounter the pitfall pertaining to surface adhesivity and corrosivity over device modules. Here, an innovative approach of synergizing liquid metals with 2D magnetic materials is presented, accordingly creating chromium(III)&#8208;telluride&#8208;coated liquid metal (CT&#8211;LM) droplets via a simple self&#8208;assembly process. The CT&#8211;LM droplets exhibit controllable deformation and locomotion under magnetic fields, demonstrate nonadherence to various surfaces, and enable cost&#8208;effective recycling of components. The functionality of CT&#8211;LM droplets is validated through their use in magnetointeractive memory devices to enable sensing/storing 64 magnetic paths and in wearable sensors as the flexible vibrator for dynamic gesture recognition with machine learning assistance. This work opens new avenues for the functional droplet design and broadens the horizons of flexible electronics.

         <title>Hydrogen&#8208;Bonded Organic Framework Nanoscintillators for X&#8208;Ray&#8208;Induced Photodynamic Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators (BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG) is designed and engineered to enhance X&#8208;PDT for unresectable HCC treatment. Precise tumor localization capability of SRT and effective X&#8208;ray energy absorbing and transferring capability of BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG endowing BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG&#8208;mediated X&#8208;PDT approach with significant HCC therapeutic potential. Therefore, phosphorescent HOF&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT is an ideal alternative therapy for patients with unresectable HCC.








Abstract
X&#8208;ray induced photodynamic therapy (X&#8208;PDT) leverages penetrating X&#8208;ray to generate singlet oxygen (1O2) for treating deep&#8208;seated tumors. However, conventional X&#8208;PDT typically relies on heavy metal inorganic scintillators and organic photosensitizers to produce 1O2, which presents challenges related to toxicity and energy conversion efficiency. In this study, highly biocompatible organic phosphorescent nanoscintillators based on hydrogen&#8208;bonded organic frameworks (HOF) are designed and engineered, termed BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG, to enhance X&#8208;PDT in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment. BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG functions simultaneously as both scintillator and photosensitizer, effectively absorbing and transferring X&#8208;ray energy to generate abundant 1O2. Both in vitro and in vivo investigations demonstrate that internalized BPT&#8208;HOF@PEG efficiently produces significant quantities of 1O2 upon X&#8208;ray irradiation. Additionally, X&#8208;ray exposure directly inflicts DNA damage, and the synergistic effects of these mechanisms result in pronounced cell death and substantial tumor growth inhibition, with a significant inhibition rate of up to 90.4% in vivo assessments. RNA sequencing analyses reveal that X&#8208;PDT induces apoptosis in Hepa1&#8208;6 cells while inhibiting cell proliferation, culminating in tumor cell death. Therefore, this work highlights the considerable potential of efficient phosphorescent HOF nanoscintillators&#8208;based X&#8208;PDT as a promising therapeutic approach for HCC, providing a highly effective alternative with negligible toxicity for patients with unresectable tumors.

         <title>Two Material Properties from One Wavelength&#8208;Orthogonal Photoresin Enabled by a Monochromatic Laser Integrated Stereolithographic Apparatus (Mono LISA)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single object with dual properties &#8211; degradable and non&#8208;degradable &#8211; is fabricated in a single print simply by switching the printing colors. The advanced multi&#8208;material printing is enabled by the combination of a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal photoresin and a monochromatic tunable laser printer, paving the way for precise multi&#8208;material differentiation within a single print.









Abstract
Multi&#8208;material printing has experienced critical advances in recent years, yet material property differentiation capabilities remain limited both with regard to the accessible properties &#8211; typically hard versus soft &#8211; and the achievable magnitude of differentiation. To enhance multi&#8208;material printing capabilities, precise photochemical control during 3D printing is essential. Wavelength&#8208;differentiation is a particularly intriguing concept yet challenging to implement. Notably, dual&#8208;wavelength printing to fabricate hard and soft sections within one object has emerged, where one curing process is insensitive to visible light, while UV irradiation inevitably activates the entire resin, limiting true spatio&#8208;temporal control of the material properties. Until now, pathway&#8208;independent wavelength&#8208;orthogonal printing has not been realized, where each wavelength exclusively triggers only one of two possible reactions, independent of the order in which the wavelengths are applied. Herein, a multi&#8208;wavelength printing technique is introduced employing a tunable laser to monochromatically deliver light to the printing platform loaded with a fully wavelength&#8208;orthogonal resin. Guided by photochemical action plots, two distinct wavelengths &#8211; each highly selective toward a specific photocycloaddtion reaction &#8211; are utilized to generate distinct networks within the photoresin. Ultimately, together with the printing technique, this orthogonally addressable photoresin allows fabricating multi&#8208;material objects with degradable and non&#8208;degradable properties, in a single fabrication step.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Gradient Silk&#8208;Based Hydrogel for Spatially Targeted Delivery and Osteochondral Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 13, April 2, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;gradient silk&#8208;based hydrogel is developed via an electric&#8208;field&#8208;driven method to enhance osteochondral regeneration. By integrating biomechanical and biochemical gradients, the hydrogel mimics native tissue architecture, directing site&#8208;specific cell differentiation. Encapsulated TGF&#8208;&#946;1 nanocapsules ensure sustained release, promoting cartilage formation and subchondral bone remodeling, demonstrating its potential for regenerative medicine and targeted therapies.








Abstract
Contemporary clinical interventions for cartilage injuries focus on symptom management through pharmaceuticals and surgical procedures. Recent research has aimed at developing innovative scaffolds with biochemical elements, yet challenges like inadequate targeted delivery and reduced load&#8208;bearing capacity hinder their adoption. Inspired by the spatial gradients of biophysical and biochemical cues in native osteochondral tissues, a silk&#8208;based hydrogel that facilitates spontaneous dual&#8208;gradient formation, including mechanical gradients and growth factor gradients, for tissue regeneration, is presented. Driven by an electrical field, the hydrogel transitions from stiff to soft along the anode&#8208;to&#8208;cathode direction, mimicking the anisotropic structure of natural tissues. Simultaneously, incorporated growth factors encapsulated by charged monomers migrate to the cathode region, creating another parallel gradient that enables their sustained release. This design maintains bioactivity and enhances programmable growth factor concentration in the defect environment. In a rabbit model with full&#8208;thickness osteochondral defects, the dual&#8208;gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.

In a rabbit model with full-thickness osteochondral defects, the dual-gradient hydrogel demonstrates significant potential for promoting osteochondral regeneration, offering a promising tool for clinical translation.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Highly cycle&#8208;stable photo&#8208;assisted all&#8208;solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries are successfully designed and constructed based on computational screening of catalytic active fillers and mechanical reinforcement from natural lignocellulose fillers, combined with the coupling mechanism of light&#8208;driven and photoelectrochemical storage. These innovations enable the flexible photo&#8208;assisted pouch battery to achieve a high discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1, while maintaining 89.1% capacity retention after 300 cycles at 1 C.








Abstract
The advancement of photo&#8208;assisted rechargeable sodium&#8208;metal batteries with high energy efficiency, lightweight structure, and simplified design is crucial for the growing demand in portable electronics. However, addressing the intrinsic safety concerns of liquid electrolytes and the sluggish reaction kinetics in existing photoelectrochemical storage cathodes (PSCs) remains a significant challenge. In this work, functionalized light&#8208;driven composite solid electrolyte (CSE) fillers are systematically screened, and optimized PSC materials are employed to construct advanced photo&#8208;assisted solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery (PSSMB). To further enhance the mechanical properties and poly(ethylene oxide) compatibility of the CSE, natural lignocellulose is incorporated, enabling the fabrication of flexible PSSMBs. In situ tests and density functional theory calculations reveal that the light&#8208;driven electric field facilitated sodium salt dissociation, reduced interfacial resistance, and improved ionic conductivity (0.1 mS cm&#8722;1). Meanwhile, energy&#8208;level matching of the PSC maximized the utilization of photogenerated carriers, accelerating reaction kinetics and enhancing interface compatibility between the electrolyte and cathode. The resulting flexible pouch&#8208;type PSSMB demonstrates a remarkable discharge capacity of 117 mAh g&#8722;1 and outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability, retaining 89.1% of its capacity and achieving an energy storage efficiency of 96.8% after 300 cycles at 1 C. This study highlights a versatile strategy for advancing safe, high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state batteries.

         <title>Acoustic Valley Filter, Valve, and Diverter</title>

The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics. The implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Utilizing the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the long&#8208;desired valley devices, such as filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported.

Abstract
The discovery of valley degrees of freedom in electronic and classical waves opened the field of valleytronics and offered the prospect for new devices based on valleys. However, the implementation of valley&#8208;based devices remains challenging in practice. Here, by taking advantage of the flexibility of phononic crystals in design and fabrication, the realizations of valley devices, or filters, valves, and diverters for acoustic waves are reported. All the devices are configured as the structures of input and output ports bridged by channels. The phononic crystals serving as ports allow the propagation of both valley polarizations, whereas the phononic crystals serving as channels, as they are narrow, only allow the propagation of single polarizations. For valley filters that achieve valley&#8208;polarized currents, the bridge channel is simply a straight single phononic crystal, but for valley valves that can turn off the valley&#8208;polarized currents, the channel consists of two parts, allowing the propagation of opposite valley polarizations. The valley diverters have one input port, and two output ports, and thus a branched channel, and the three parts in the channel allow the propagation of the same valley polarizations, so that the energy flow can be partitioned. The results may serve as a basis for developing advanced acoustic valley devices.

         <title>Doping Mo Triggers Charge Distribution Optimization and P Vacancy of Ni2P@Ni12P5 Heterojunction for Industrial Electrocatalytic Production of Adipic Acid and H2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust Mo&#8208;dopedNi2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with rich P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of CHA to AA and HER at large current density with 85.7% yield of AA and 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production at 232&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Synergistic charge optimization and P vacancy by Mo Doping endows the enhanced bifunctional performances.








Abstract
Synchronous electrosynthesis of value&#8208;added adipic acid (AA) and H2 is extremely crucial for carbon neutrality. However, accomplishing the preparation of AA and H2 at large current density with high selectivity is still challenging. Herein, a robust Mo&#8208;doped Ni2P@Ni12P5 heterojunction with more P vacancies on Ni foam is proposed for accomplishing simultaneous electrooxidation of cyclohexanol (CHAOR) to AA and hydrogen evolution reaction (HER)&#160;at large current density. Combined X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure, and electron spin resonance confirm that Mo incorporation induces the charge redistribution of Ni2P@Ni12P5, where Mo adjusts electrons from Ni to P, and triggers more P vacancies. Further experimental and theoretical investigations reveal that the d&#8208;band center is upshifted, optimizing adsorption energies of water and hydrogen on electron&#8208;rich P site for boosting HER activity. Besides, more Ni3+ generated from electron&#8208;deficient Ni induced by Mo, alongside more OH* triggered from more P vacancies concurrently promote CHA dehydrogenation and C&#9472;C bond cleavage, decreasing energy barrier of CHAOR. Consequently, a two&#8208;electrode flow electrolyzer achieves industrial current density (&gt;230&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) with 85.7% AA yield, 100% Faradaic efficiency of H2 production. This study showcases an industrial bifunctional electrocatalyst for AA and H2 production with high productivity.

         <title>Nanosized Multistate Configurations of Relaxor&#8208;Like Antiferroelectric Revealed by Atomic&#8208;Scale In Situ Electron Microscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic&#8208;scale in situ heating scanning transmission electron microscopy of the (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials reveals the origin of characteristic hysteresis behavior of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. The nanosized multistate configurations which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. Such nanosized multistate configurations break the common belief of single&#8208;phase antiferroelectric nanodomains.








Abstract
Antiferroelectric materials have garnered significant attention for their potential applications in high&#8208;power capacitors. Among the four technically important types of ferroelectric states&#8208;classical ferroelectric, relaxor ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and relaxor antiferroelectric&#8208;the first three have well&#8208;defined physical pictures, while the fourth remains contentious. Here, atomic&#8208;scale in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy is demonstrated to provide a clear resolution to this long&#8208;standing issue. The temperature&#8208;dependent configurational evolution during the transition from room&#8208;temperature classical antiferroelectric to high&#8208;temperature relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric in (Pb,La)(Zr,Sn,Ti)O3 materials is directly observed. The nanosized multistate configurations formed during transformation, which encompass antiferroelectric, quasi&#8208;paraelectric, and ferroelectric nanoregions, are responsible for the slim double hysteresis loops characteristic of relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectric. These findings offer new guidelines for validating the physical models essential for the development of high&#8208;performance relaxor&#8208;like antiferroelectrics.

         <title>A Bioinspired Micro&#8208;Grooved Structure for Low Snow Adhesion and Effective Snow&#8208;Shedding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired micro&#8208;groove structure is developed to address the challenges of snow and ice accumulation. By minimizing capillary effects, and reducing mechanical interlocking, this multifunctional design highlights two key metrics for snow prevention surfaces: adhesion reduction and shedding efficiency, paving the way for applications in energy systems and architecture.








Abstract
Many outdoor devices require effective snow prevention solutions, yet existing passive anti&#8208;icing technologies are inadequate for snow repellency due to the variability of snow properties. This study addresses this gap by proposing a bioinspired micro&#8208;grooved anti&#8208;snow structure that minimizes van der Waals forces through reduced contact area and mitigates capillary effects via a V&#8208;shaped design, facilitating the separation of liquid water at the interface. Snow&#8208;shedding performance is shown to be highly sensitive to surface roughness, with the periodic smoothness of micro&#8208;grooves significantly reducing mechanical interlocking with snow. In contrast, hierarchical superhydrophobic structures strongly interlock with ice grains, preventing spontaneous snow&#8208;shedding even at extremely low adhesion forces. By embedding superhydrophobic nanoparticles into the micro&#8208;groove structure, this study presents a multifunctional design that integrates anti&#8208;icing, anti&#8208;snow, and water&#8208;repellent properties. Experimental results demonstrate that the structure effectively balances adhesion reduction and snow&#8208;shedding performance, showing promising potential for photovoltaic solar power systems and large&#8208;scale architectural applications.

         <title>Highly Branched Poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s for Efficient mRNA Delivery and Nebulization Treatment of Silicosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address off&#8208;target organ enrichment and low endosomal escape during mRNA delivery, the study learns from the technology of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) and integrate cholesterol moieties and zwitterionic species into branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (hPAEs) to obtain &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; LNP&#8208;like hPAEs (O&#8208;LhPAEs), which have spleen&#8208;targeted delivery and have potential for the treatment of silicosis by nebulization.








Abstract
mRNA therapeutics hold tremendous promise for disease prevention and treatment. Development of high&#8208;performance mRNA delivery systems with enhanced transfection efficiency and a safety profile will further fulfill their therapeutic potential and expedite their translation. The synthesis of &#8220;four&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; highly branched poly(&#946;&#8208;amino ester)s (O&#8208;LhPAEs) is reported by integrating the essential components of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for spleen&#8208;selective mRNA enrichment and nebulization treatment of silicosis. 60 O&#8208;LhPAEs with distinct branched structure and chemical composition, including tertiary/quaternary amines, cholesterol moieties, zwitterionic species, and hydrophobic alkyl tails, are synthesized using sequential Michael addition, ring&#8208;opening, and nucleophilic substitution reactions. The unique topological structure and chemical composition collectively enhanced O&#8208;LhPAEs/mRNA polyplex serum resistance, cellular uptake, and endosomal escape. The optimal O&#8208;LhPAE, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12, exhibits up to 93.1% mRNA transfection across 11 different cell types, including epithelial cells, fibroblasts, cancer cells, stem cells, neurological cells, and astrocytes. Biodistribution study reveals that 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12/mRNA polyplexes are mainly enriched in the spleen following systemic administration. Through nebulization, 20%b&#8208;3C&#8208;2P12 mediated high Tbx2 mRNA expression in the lungs of silicosis mice, effectively restoring lung functions. This study not only establishes a strategy for development of LNP&#8208;like O&#8208;LhPAEs but also provides promising candidates for highly safe, efficient, and spleen&#8208;selective mRNA delivery and nebulization treatment of silicosis.

         <title>Enabling Multicolor Circularly Polarized Organic Long Persistent Luminescence through Chiral Exciplex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Long&#8208;lived circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) is achieved by constructing a chiral exciplex system, with green CP&#8208;OLPL emission lasting over 1.5 hours and exhibiting an asymmetry factor of 4.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. Additionally, by incorporating a fluorophore emitter and utilizing synergistic singlet&#8208;singlet and chirality energy transfer, an orange&#8208;red CP&#8208;OLPL with a duration exceeding 1 hour is realized, showcasing its potential for applications in&#160;afterglow display and lighting, and multi&#8208;level information encryption.








Abstract
Circularly polarized organic long persistent luminescence (CP&#8208;OLPL) has garnered significant attention due to its distinctive properties. However, achieving CP&#8208;OLPL materials with ultralong durations remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an effective strategy is proposed to obtain long&#8208;lived CP&#8208;OLPL by constructing a self&#8208;designed chiral donor for developing a host&#8211;guest chiral exciplex system. The gradual recombination of long&#8208;lived charge&#8208;separated states enables a green CP&#8208;OLPL emission to persist for over 1.5 hours with an asymmetry factor (|glum|) of 4.5 &#215; 10&#8722;3. More intriguingly, doping with rubrene fluorophore yields an orange&#8208;red CP&#8208;OLPL system, exhibiting a duration over 1 hour and |glum| of 2.3 &#215; 10&#8722;3 through synergistic singlet&#8208;singlet and chirality energy transfer. These properties render the development of chiral afterglow display, multi&#8208;level information encryption, and afterglow lighting. This work not only represents a significant advancement in the design of chiral donors for ultralong CP&#8208;OLPL exciplex system with durations but also provides valuable insights into exciton dynamics.

         <title>Recent Advances in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ubiquitous defects predominately account for photo&#8208;instability and open&#8208;circuit voltage losses in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs). This review comprehensively presents the underlying impact mechanisms, summarizes the advanced optimization strategies across various functional layers and their interfaces to develop efficient and stable WBG PSCs, and evaluates their performance in semitransparent solar cells, tandem solar cells, and indoor photovoltaic applications.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top&#8208;cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect&#8208;mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self&#8208;accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi&#8208;Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross&#8208;sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.

&lt;p&gt;Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have garnered considerable attention of late for their potential as semitransparent photovoltaics for building integration, top-cells in tandem configurations, and indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) for Internet of Things (IoT) applications. However, recent investigations have unveiled that underlying defect-mediated phase segregation, ion migration, lattice strain, and other factors can give rise to self-accelerated degradation reactions and the contraction of quasi-Fermi level splitting (QFLS) within devices. Extensive efforts have been undertaken to reduce defect densities in bulks, at surfaces, and across interfaces with charge transport layers (CTLs). This review provides a timely and comprehensive understanding of the intrinsic defect ecosystem in WBG perovskites, and mechanistically elucidates their impacts on device stability and open circuit voltage losses. Subsequently, recent advances in defect passivation strategies are cross-sectionally overviewed, covering various components of devices. The applications of WBG PSCs in semitransparent devices, tandem applications, and IPVs are discussed. Finally, prospects and challenges are proposed, providing insights for future research and technological advancements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Efficient White Electroluminescence from Cu&#8208;based Perovskite Achieved by High Hole Injection Core/Shell Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide lattice connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals by controlling the reactivity of sulfur precursor in the synthesis. The resulting pure white PeLEDs achieved by combining with yellow emission CsCu2I3 exhibit a recorded EQE of 3.45% and a high CRI of 91.








Abstract
The copper&#8208;based (Cu&#8208;based) halide perovskite possesses eco&#8208;friendly features, bright self&#8208;trapped&#8208;exciton (broadband) emission, and a high color&#8208;rendering index (CRI) for achieving white emission. However, the limited hole injection (HI) of Cu&#8208;based perovskites has been bottle&#8208;necking the efficiency of white electroluminescence and thus their application in white perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (W&#8208;PeLEDs). In this study, we demonstrate a p&#8208;type cuprous sulfide (Cu2S) lattice&#8208;connectedly capping over Cs3Cu2I5 to form lattice&#8208;matched core/shell nanocrystals (NCs) by controlling the reactivity of sulfur (S) precursor in the synthesis. Interestingly, the resultant Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S NCs significantly enhance the hole mobility compared to Cs3Cu2I5 NCs. Besides, the photoluminescence quantum yield of Cs3Cu2I5 NCs increases from 26.8% to 70.6% after the Cu2S lattice&#8208;connected capping. Consequently, by establishing the structure of CsCu2I3/Cs3Cu2I5/Cu2S in W&#8208;PeLEDs, an external quantum efficiency of 3.45% and a CRI of 91 is realized, representing the highest reported electroluminescent performance in lead&#8208;free Cu&#8208;based W&#8208;PeLEDs. These findings contribute to establishing guidelines and effective strategies for designing broadband electroluminescent materials and device structures of PeLEDs.

         <title>Direct Observation of Unidirectional Exciton Polaritons in Layered van der Waals Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional hybridized exciton&#8208;polariton (EPs). The resolution to observe near&#8208;field SOC can be very high (down to 10&#160;nm) and the contrast can be clearly distinguished at the real&#8208;space. The work provides an alternative but more direct approach to uncover the underlying physics of optical SOC and EP properties.








Abstract
Unidirectional excitation of highly confined guided modes is essential for nanoscale energy transport, photonic integrated devices, and quantum information processing. Among various feasible approaches, the mechanism based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling is investigated for unidirectional routing of surface plasmons and valley exciton&#8208;polaritons, without needing the use of complicated magneto&#8208;optical effects and parity symmetry breaking. So far, the direct near&#8208;field nanoimaging of such exotic polaritonic modes based on optical spin&#8211;orbit coupling has remained elusive. Here, the real&#8208;space nanoimaging of unidirectional polaritons in van der Waals semiconductors are reported. Specifically, photonic spins are coupled into the tip of a scattering&#8208;type scanning near&#8208;field optical microscopy for circular dipolar excitations of spin&#8211;orbit interactions, thus enabling the unidirectional waveguide exciton&#8208;polariton propagation with remarkable unidirectionality (ratio of spectrum amplitudes under opposite circularly polarized illumination) R = 0.291 for TM mode. Via switching to the opposite helicities, the reversed opposite directions are observed. The work offers a promising avenue for detecting and processing spin information for future communication technology at the nanoscale.

         <title>Synchronous Sterilization and Immunoreaction Termination for Corneal Transparency Protection in Treating Pseudomonas aeruginosa Induced Bacterial Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The large&#8208;pore MSNs with a high specific surface area serve as a platform for covalent PMB grafting and bactericidal CQD loading. CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits efficient antibacterial activity alongside synchronous endotoxin neutralization. In Gram&#8208;negative bacterial keratitis, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB effectively and comprehensively suppresses the immune&#8208;inflammatory response, preserving corneal integrity and transparency.








Abstract
In the treatment of infectious keratitis, therapeutic strategies often prioritize enhancing bactericidal efficacy. However, endotoxins released from Gram&#8208;negative bacteria cause inflammatory reaction, leading to corneal structural damage and scar formation. Given that polymyxin B (PMB) can bind and neutralize lipopolysaccharide (LPS), this study employs large&#8208;pore mesoporous silica nanoparticles (lMSNs) grafted with PMB as carriers for cationic antibacterial carbon quantum dots (CQDs) to prepare CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB, which enables synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization. In the acidic infectious microenvironment, the accelerated release of CQDs eliminates 99.88% bacteria within 2&#160;h, effectively substituting immune mediated sterilization. Notably, CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB exhibits exceptional LPS neutralization performance (2.22&#160;&#181;g LPS/mg CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB) due to its high specific surface area. In an infectious keratitis model, inflammation subsides significantly within the first day of CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB intervention and is completely resolved by day 3. By day 2, interleukin&#8208;1&#946;, interleukin&#8208;6 and tumor necrosis factor&#8208;&#945; in CQD@lMSN&#8208;PMB group decrease by 86.99%, 91.15%, and 77.56%, respectively, compared to the CQDs&#8208;only sterilization group. Ultimately, corneal integrity and transparency are preserved, with suppressed expressions of fibrosis&#8208;related factors including matrix metalloproteinase 9, transforming growth factor&#8208;&#946; and &#945;&#8208;smooth muscle actin. Therefore, this synchronous sterilization and endotoxin neutralization strategy outperforms monotherapy strategies focused solely on sterilization or endotoxin neutralization.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Hybrid Organic&#8208;Inorganic Lanthanide Halide Glass Scintillators Enabled by Dehydration for Efficient X&#8208;Ray Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an effective strategy for developing high&#8208;performance hybrid organic&#8208;inorganic lanthanide halide glass scintillators for X&#8208;ray imaging through the dehydration of crystalline precursors. This process not only effectively suppresses melt crystallization but also enhances radioluminescence by improving X&#8208;ray&#8208;to&#8208;visible photon conversion efficiency. Thus, it enables the fabrication of large, transparent scintillators suitable for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
Although glass scintillators hold great promise for high&#8208;resolution X&#8208;ray imaging, the practical application is often limited by thermodynamic instability, leading to uncontrolled glass&#8208;to&#8208;crystal transformations that degrade imaging resolution. Herein, a novel strategy is presented to synthesize (methyl(triphenyl)phosphonium)3EuCl6 ((MTP)3EuCl6) glass scintillators through the dehydration of their crystalline precursors. The findings reveal that the dehydration process significantly enhances the stability of the glass scintillators by confining the constituent ions within a rigid, highly viscous matrix. This confinement effectively restricts ion mobility and prevents the reorganization required for crystal nucleation. Moreover, the dehydration reduces the trapping of in situ generated charge carriers and increases the photoluminescence quantum yield, leading to enhanced radioluminescence performance. The resulting (MTP)3EuCl6 glass scintillators demonstrate an X&#8208;ray detection limit as low as 95.8 nGyair s&#8315;&#185; and achieve a spatial imaging resolution of 14.3 lp mm&#8722;1 at a dose rate of 5 mGyair s&#8315;&#185;. This work provides valuable insights into designing glass scintillators that integrate long&#8208;term thermodynamic stability with optimized scintillation performance, offering significant potential for advanced X&#8208;ray imaging applications.

         <title>Cell&#8208;Sheet Shape Transformation by Internally&#8208;Driven, Oriented Forces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy is implemented to embed dermal fibroblasts in collagen&#160;in contact with anisotropic hydrogel fibers. Fibroblasts generate traction forces and remodel the collagen matrix, following the alignment cues of the hydrogel template. The orientational order is transferred to the fibroblasts, inducing collective alignment. Cell alignment generates internally driven, oriented forces that ultimately lead to programmed 2D and 3D shape changes of the cell&#8208;laden collagen matrices, such as&#160;transforming from square to diamond, or from flat to dome. This approach provides insights into the role of topological defects in morphogenesis and advances new techniques for developing shape&#8208;morphing materials with programmable forces.








Abstract
During morphogenesis, cells collectively execute directional forces that drive the programmed folding and growth of the layers, forming tissues and organs. The ability to recapitulate aspects of these processes in&#160; vitro will constitute a significant leap forward in the field of tissue engineering. Free&#8208;standing, self&#8208;organizing, cell&#8208;laden matrices are fabricated using a sequential deposition approach that uses liquid crystal&#8208;templated hydrogel fibers to direct cell arrangements. The orientation of hydrogel fibers is controlled using flow or boundary cues, while their microstructures are controlled by depletion interaction and probed by scattering and microscopy. These fibers effectively direct cells embedded in a collagen matrix, creating multilayer structures through contact guidance and by leveraging steric interactions amongst the cells. In uniformly aligned cell matrices, oriented cells exert traction forces that can induce preferential contraction of the matrix. Simultaneously, the matrix densifies and develops anisotropy through cell remodeling. Such an approach can be extended to create cell arrangements with arbitrary in&#8208;plane patterns, allowing for coordinated cell forces and pre&#8208;programmed, macroscopic shape changes. This work reveals a fundamentally new path for controlled force generation, emphasizing the role of a carefully designed initial orientational field for manipulating shape transformations of reconstituted&#160;matrices.

         <title>From Molecule to Aggregate: Designing AIE Nanocrystals for Low&#8208;Power Backward Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation Angiography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic BTHG agent called OTBP with prominent crystallinity is developed. The resonant absorption at 433&#160;nm and prominent crystallinity of OTBP enhance its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. Tuning the size of OTBP nanocrystals based on Mie scattering theory successfully enables them to achieve high&#8208;contrast muti&#8208;organ angiography with ultra&#8208;low pulse energy (100 pJ) and thereby negligible photodamage risk.








Abstract
Organic materials featuring third harmonic generation (THG) hold great promise for deep&#8208;tissue bioimaging due to their good biocompatibility and second near&#8208;infrared excitation. However, minimizing photodamage from the incident light necessitates significant improvements in the third&#8208;order nonlinear susceptibility. Herein, an organic luminogen called OTBP is developed as a backward THG (BTHG) contrast agent for second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II)&#160;angiography. OTBP's intense absorption at 433&#160;nm resonantly enhances its BTHG efficiency when excited by a 1300 nm femtosecond laser. In the aggregate state, the robust intermolecular interactions among OTBP molecules realize excellent crystallinity and the facile preparation of nanocrystals (NCs) with a high refractive index of 1.78. By leveraging Mie scattering theory, the best size of OTBP NCs for BTHG collection is attained. These integrated properties result in a high BTHG efficiency of OTBP NCs. Encapsulating the NCs with F&#8208;127 enables ultralow&#8208;power but high&#8208;contrast 3D vasculature imaging with negligible photodamage and background interference. Further elevating the laser power to 60&#160;mW enables the visualization of microvessels at 500&#160;&#181;m with a high SNR of 143. This study offers insights into material design strategies toward efficient organic BTHG contrast agents and paves the way for the materials&#8208;oriented non&#8208;linear optics.

         <title>Charge Polarization Tunable Interfaces for Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid of Me&#8208;4PACz. This process enhances charge delocalization via electrostatic attraction between oppositely charged molecules, yielding a Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM charge polarization interface that improves NiOx p&#8208;type conductivity, facilitates band alignment, and supports high&#8208;quality perovskite films, showcasing its commercial potential.








Abstract
Interfacial localized charges and interfacial losses from incompatible underlayers are critical factors limiting the efficiency improvement and market&#8208;integration of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, a novel interfacial chemical tuning strategy is proposed involving proton transfer between the amine head of pyridoxamine (PM) and the phosphonic acid anchoring group of [4&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)butyl]phosphonic acid (Me&#8208;4PACz), with simultaneous enhancement of charge delocalization through electrostatic attraction between opposite charged molecules. The Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM charge polarization interface modulates the nickel oxide (NiOx) charge states and the coordination environment at buried interfaces, consequently enhancing p&#8208;type conductivity and obtaining a more compatible band arrangement. The high&#8208;coverage and wettability of the NiOx/Me&#8208;4PACz&#8208;PM underlayer also facilitate the deposition of high&#8208;quality perovskite films, releasing lattice strain and mitigating trap&#8208;assisted non&#8208;radiative recombination. Attributing to the implementation of charge polarization tunable interfaces, small&#8208;area devices and modules with an aperture area of 69 cm2 achieved impressive power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 26.34% (certified 25.48%) and 21.94% (certified 20.50%), respectively, and unencapsulated devices maintained their initial PCEs &#8776;90% after aging for 2000&#160;h (ISOS&#8208;L&#8208;1) and 1500&#160;h (ISOS&#8208;D&#8208;1). The broad applicability of charge polarization tunable interfaces and the successful scaling of large&#8208;area modules provide a reference for expanding PSCs applications.

         <title>Conductive Polymer Coatings Control Reaction Selectivity in All&#8208;Iron Redox Flow Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aqueous redox flow batteries are limited by the competing hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) at their negative electrodes. In this work, conductive polymers are conformally coated on porous carbonaceous electrodes to improve the reaction selectivity of hybrid all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries. Poly(pyrrole)/PSS coating inhibits HER in acidic media and increases the battery lifetime, while PEDOT/PSS electrode improves the roundtrip efficiency.








Abstract
Aqueous all&#8208;iron redox flow batteries are an attractive and economic technology for grid&#8208;scale energy storage owing to their use of abundant and environmentally benign iron as the redox active material and water as solvent. However, the battery operation is challenged by the plating/stripping reactions of iron and the competing hydrogen evolution reaction at the negative electrode, which hinder performance and durability. Here, the reaction selectivity of the negative electrode is tailored by introducing conductive polymer coatings onto porous carbonaceous electrodes. Two conductive polymers, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) and poly(pyrrole) (PPy) are conformally coated with the dopant poly(4&#8208;styrenesulfonate) (PSS) and the resulting electrochemistry is studied on model electroanalytical platforms and redox flow batteries. Both polymers decrease the hydrogen evolution current on rotating disc electrodes, with PPy/PSS strongly inhibiting the reaction at high overpotentials. In full all&#8208;iron redox flow cells, PPy/PSS coating extends cyclability and significantly reduces hydrogen evolution, while PEDOT/PSS coating improves the round&#8208;trip efficiency, possibly acting as a redox shuttle for the iron stripping reaction. These findings motivate broader investigation and implementation of conductive polymers to engineer reaction selectivity for flow batteries and other electrochemical technologies.

         <title>Metal&#8208;polyphenol Multistage Competitive Coordination System for Colorimetric Monitoring Meat Freshness</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a multistage competitive coordination chromogenic mechanism between metal&#8208;polyphenols and amines. Based on this, a metal&#8208;polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN&#8208;CSA) for real&#8208;time monitoring of meat freshness has been developed, achieving a detection rate of 99.83% through convolutional neural network technology. This sensitive, accurate, stable, eco&#8208;friendly, and economical solution can enhance food safety and reduce food waste.








Abstract
A low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;precision, and secure real&#8208;time system for monitoring food freshness can significantly improve spoilage issues, yet traditional colorimetric sensor arrays often suffer from chemical dyes&#8217; high toxicity and limited color changes. Here, a metal&#8208;polyphenol network colorimetric sensor array (MPN&#8208;CSA) is built for detecting total volatile base nitrogen (TVB&#8208;N) markers of meat freshness. The multi&#8208;level competitive coordination process between the metal&#8208;polyphenol system and amine substances endows the system with color changes far beyond those of traditional dyes (reaching a detection limit of 300 ppb). By integrating convolutional neural network (CNN) technology, an online platform is developed for monitoring meat freshness, achieving an overall detection accuracy rate of 99.83%. This environmentally friendly, economically viable MPN&#8208;CSA that monitors the freshness of meat in complex storage environments can be incorporated into food packaging boxes, enabling consumers and suppliers to assess the freshness of meat in real&#8208;time, thus helping to reduce food waste and prevent foodborne illnesses.

         <title>In Situ Construction of a 3D Superionic Skeleton in Sodium Anode for Solid&#8208;State Sodium Batteries with a 15&#160;000&#8208;Cycle Lifespan at 3C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

In this work, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion coefficient of the anode from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Thanks to the ultrafast ion transport and excellent interfacial stability, the solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal battery can be stably cycled for more than 15&#160;000&#8208;cycle at 3C.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;state sodium&#8208;metal batteries (SSSMBs) have emerged as a promising candidate for next&#8208;generation energy storage systems due to their natural abundance, cost&#8208;effectiveness, and high safety. However, the intrinsically low ionic conductivity of sodium anode (SA) and poor wettability to solid&#8208;state electrolyte (SSE) severely hinder the development of SSSMBs. In this study, a 3D superionic transport skeleton Na3P is in situ constructed within the sodium anode by simply melting inexpensive and low&#8208;density red phosphorus with sodium, which successfully enhances the ion diffusion rate from 2.54 &#215; 10&#8210;8 to 1.33 &#215; 10&#8210;7 cm2 s&#8210;1. Moreover, Na3P in the composite sodium anode (CSA) effectively induces the uniform deposition of Na on the surface of SSE, significantly reducing the interface impedance of symmetric cells from the initial value of 749.15 to 14.97 &#937; cm2. Enabled by the integrated 3D superionic transport skeleton, the symmetric cell achieves exceptional cycle stability of over 7000&#160;h at 0.1&#160;mA cm&#8210;2 and 4000&#160;h at 0.3&#160;mA cm&#8210;2. Furthermore, SSSMBs incorporating CSA demonstrate an ultralong lifespan of over 15&#160;000 cycles at 3C while maintaining a high&#8208;loading operation capability, significantly outperforming previously reported studies. This study highlights the crucial role of cost&#8208;effective CSA design with enhanced ion transport in advancing high&#8208;performance SSSMBs.

         <title>Wettability Sequence Optimization and Interface Strain Buffering in Triple Mesoporous Layer&#8208;Based Printable Perovskite Solar Cells for Enhanced Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells is regulated via the flexible molecule of dodecaethylene glycol (DEG) with abundant polar oxygen atoms. The regulation modulated the wetting sequence of the scaffold, promoted perovskite crystallization in the scaffold, and relaxed interface stress. The device with interface regulation successfully achieved an improved power conversion efficiency of 20.27% and demonstrated good stability.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells have achieved remarkable progress in photovoltaic performance, driven by advancements in interface engineering. The buried interface between the electron transport layer and the perovskite layer is particularly critical, as it governs both perovskite crystallization and the formation of residual strain. In this study, the buried interface in printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells (p&#8208;MPSCs) based on a triple&#8208;mesoporous scaffold of TiO2/ZrO2/carbon is reconstructed by employing dodecaethylene glycol (DEG), a long chain molecule rich in polar oxygen atoms, to enhance device performance. Treating the scaffold with DEG optimizes the wettability sequence across the three layers by improving the TiO2 surface's wettability, facilitating the preferential crystallization of perovskite in the underlying TiO2 layer. Moreover, the DEG layer effectively buffers residual strain and suppresses detrimental defects at the interface. As a result, p&#8208;MPSCs with the optimized interface achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.27% and retain over 92% of their initial PCE after 500 h of continuous operation under maximum power point tracking.

         <title>Optothermal&#8208;Stimulated Persistent Luminescence Imaging and Therapy (OSPLIT)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports an effective strategy, OSPLIT (optothermal&#8208;stimulated persistent luminescence imaging and therapy), which enables high&#8208;contrast imaging and the thermal ablation of lymph node metastases. The rational design of these nanomaterials is detailed and mechanistic insights are provided, demonstrating the advantages of optothermal&#8208;stimulated NIR&#8208;II persistent luminescence in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles over conventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence imaging.








Abstract
Persistent luminescent nanomaterials have significantly advanced in vivo bioimaging and biosensing by emitting photons after excitation ceases, effectively minimizing tissue autofluorescence. However, their application in biomedical fields such as tumor theranostics is limited by low brightness and rapid signal decay. To address these issues, OSPLIT (optothermal&#8208;stimulated persistent luminescence imaging therapy), a dual&#8208;function strategy for imaging and treatment is introduced. The OSPLIT approach enhances the release of charge carriers from deep traps in lanthanide&#8208;doped nanoparticles, resulting in a 73 fold increase in persistent luminescence within the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) window. In living mice, it enables high&#8208;contrast imaging of lymph node metastases, with a signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio 11.8 times greater than conventional NIR&#8208;II fluorescence. Optothermal&#8208;boosted nanoparticles are effective in ablating lymph node metastasis and preventing tumor spread. These findings highlight the potential of optothermal stimulation to enhance persistent luminescence for both imaging and therapeutic applications.

         <title>Utilizing Electron&#8208;Sink&#8208;Enhanced Nanoshells for Amplified Nanoplasmonic SERS&#8208;Based In Situ Detection of Cancer Cells, Linking Signal Enhancement with Cellular Damage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for detecting cancer cells and monitoring apoptosis employs electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). Gold (Au) shells coated with electroactive liposome membranes amplify the SERS signal through active electron transfer. This technique enables real&#8208;time and highly sensitive detection of cancer cells by measuring apoptosis&#8208;associated electron flow, offering a powerful approach for distinguishing cancerous from normal cells.








Abstract
A novel method is presented for detecting cancer cells and assessing apoptosis using electron&#8208;sink&#8208;enhanced surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) via active electron transfer. By coating gold (Au) shells with electroactive liposome membranes (ELMs) derived from Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1, the SERS signal is enhanced through chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement driven by electron transfer. The ELMs first donate electrons to the Au shells, which, upon laser excitation, amplify the local electromagnetic field, resulting in stronger Raman signals from the attached probing molecules. Additionally, the electron flow from cancer cells into the Au shells correlates with apoptosis, producing a strong SERS signal, while normal cells exhibit weaker signals. This method enables real&#8208;time monitoring of cancer cell apoptosis, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells based on the enhanced Raman signal linked to electron flow. This approach marks a breakthrough in CM&#8208;based SERS applications, offering a sensitive method for cancer detection through the measurement of electron flow.

By coating gold (Au) shells with electroactive liposome membranes (ELMs) derived from &lt;i&gt;Shewanella oneidensis&lt;/i&gt; MR-1, the SERS signal is enhanced through chemical mechanism (CM) enhancement driven by electron transfer. The ELMs first donate electrons to the Au shells, which, upon laser excitation, amplify the local electromagnetic field, resulting in stronger Raman signals from the attached probing molecules. Additionally, the electron flow from cancer cells into the Au shells correlates with apoptosis, producing a strong SERS signal, while normal cells exhibit weaker signals. This method enables real-time monitoring of cancer cell apoptosis, distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells based on the enhanced Raman signal linked to electron flow. This approach marks a breakthrough in CM-based SERS applications, offering a sensitive method for cancer detection through the measurement of electron flow.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Rational Synthesis of Isomeric Graphdiyne Frameworks toward Single&#8208;Ruthenium Catalysts and High&#8208;Performance Nitrogen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Isomeric graphdiyne frameworks with ThSi2 topology are synthesized from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene and 6,6&#8242;&#8208;biazulene&#8208;based isomeric monomers. The biazulene&#8208;based graphdiyne framework shows narrow bandgap of down to 1.15&#160;eV and can act as new platform for loading single metal atoms for high&#8208;performance electrocatalysis.








Abstract
Graphdiynes (GDYs), synthesized via direct coupling of arylacetylenes, have attracted great attention due to their unique electronic properties and structural diversity, typically forming 2D layered frameworks. However, crystalline GDY&#8208;like frameworks with 3D topology remain challenging to synthesize. Here, the study reports two highly crystalline, isomeric GDY&#8208;like frameworks with ThSi2 topology, constructed from 2,2&#8242;&#8208;binaphthalene and 6,6&#8242;&#8208;biazulene&#8208;based monomers. The azulene&#8208;based framework, due to its large dipole moment, exhibits a narrow bandgap of 1.15&#160;eV, significantly lower than its naphthalene counterpart (2.33&#160;eV). As ruthenium&#160;(Ru) single&#8208;atom supports, these frameworks enable strong Ru&#8208;diyne interactions, achieving an ammonia yield rate of 188.7 &#177;&#160;1.6&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mgcat&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 37.4 &#177;&#160;0.6%. Such bicontinuous channels and tunable electronic structures offer electrocatalysis field new opportunities. Moreover, the azulene&#8208;based framework, featuring a higher highest occupied molecular orbital&#160; and lower lowest unoccupied molecular orbital&#160; energy level, ensures superior electron mobility. These 3D crystalline frameworks introduce a new covalent organic framework (COF) family with diyne linkages and pure carbon skeletons, broadening the scope of COF materials. Their well&#8208;defined structures provide an ideal platform for tuning optoelectronic properties, enabling fundamental studies on structure&#8208;property relationships and opening new opportunities for catalytic and electronic applications.

         <title>Electro&#8208; and Magneto&#8208;Active Biomaterials for Diabetic Tissue Repair: Advantages and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Diabetic wound repair remains hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and microenvironment dysregulation. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer transformative solutions for intelligent wound monitoring and pathological microenvironment modulation. This review summarizes the advantages, biological mechanisms, and application strategies of electromagnetic biomaterials in diabetic tissue repair, focusing on skin and bone regeneration, and highlighting their potential to enhance clinical outcomes.








Abstract
The diabetic tissue repair process is frequently hindered by persistent inflammation, infection risks, and a compromised tissue microenvironment, which lead to delayed wound healing and significantly impact the quality of life for diabetic patients. Electromagnetic biomaterials offer a promising solution by enabling the intelligent detection of diabetic wounds through electric and magnetic effects, while simultaneously improving the pathological microenvironment by reducing oxidative stress, modulating immune responses, and exhibiting antibacterial action. Additionally, these materials inherently promote tissue regeneration by regulating cellular behavior and facilitating vascular and neural repair. Compared to traditional biomaterials, electromagnetic biomaterials provide advantages such as noninvasiveness, deep tissue penetration, intelligent responsiveness, and multi&#8208;stimuli synergy, demonstrating significant potential to overcome the challenges of diabetic tissue repair. This review comprehensively examines the superiority of electromagnetic biomaterials in diabetic tissue repair, elucidates the underlying biological mechanisms, and discusses specific design strategies and applications tailored to the pathological characteristics of diabetic wounds, with a focus on skin wound healing and bone defect repair. By addressing current limitations and pursuing multi&#8208;faceted strategies, electromagnetic biomaterials hold significant potential to improve clinical outcomes and enhance the quality of life for diabetic patients.

         <title>Glycated ECM Derived Carbon Dots Inhibit Tumor Vasculogenic Mimicry by Disrupting RAGE Nuclear Translocation and Its Interaction With HMGB1</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, AGEs derived is found from glycated ECM significantly promote tumor growth and VM formation through the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM can competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and inhibiting this process. This finding reveals the transformation of pathogenic substances into therapeutic targeting carriers after carbonization, reversing disease&#8208;driving factors.








Abstract
This study investigates the role of advanced glycation end&#8208;products (AGEs) in tumor vasculogenic mimicry (VM). Using high&#8208;sugar diet animal models and glycated extracellular matrix (ECM) ex vivo models, AGEs derived is demonstrated from glycated ECM significantly enhanced tumor growth and VM formation. However, carbon dots (egCDs) derived from glycated ECM effectively inhibit tumor growth and VM formation in this glycated microenvironment. Mechanistic studies show that AGEs from glycated ECM bind to the Receptor of Advanced Glycation Endproducts (RAGE) receptors on tumor cells, promoting RAGE nuclear translocation and binding with high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), which increases the transcription of Snail family transcriptional repressor 2 (SNAI2), thereby driving VM formation. However, egCDs competitively bind to RAGE, promoting its lysosomal degradation and blocking VM formation induced by the RAGE&#8208;HMGB1&#8208;SNAI2 axis. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that egCDs can target RAGE and promote its lysosomal degradation to block VM formation induced by glycated ECM. This finding not only reveals the transformation of glycated ECM from a pro&#8208;VM factor to an anti&#8208;VM therapeutic agent after carbonization, but also provides a theoretical basis for the innovative strategy of &#8220;reconstructing pathogenic substances into carbon dots to reverse disease&#8208;driving factors into therapeutic targeting carriers&#8221;.

         <title>Mechanical Robust Nacre&#8208;Mimetic Composites with Designable Cryptic Coloration and Electromagnetic Wave&#8208;Transparent Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A nacre&#8208;mimetic ceramic&#8208;polymer structural material is developed by a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy, achieving high mechanical properties, tunable colors and superior EM wave&#8208;transparent performance. These characteristics make it hold great potential as a protective material for radar and communication equipment.








Abstract
Ceramic materials are widely used in various protective equipment owing to their excellent mechanical properties and chemical stability, while their applications are limited by monotonous color and poor toughness. Inspired by the colorful and tough natural shells, nacre&#8208;mimetic alumina (Al2O3)&#8208;based (NMA) composites are fabricated by proposing a dual&#8208;oxide interface design strategy inspired by&#160;the hierarchical structure of natural nacre. The NMA composites achieve color regulation, providing possibilities for their application in camouflage protective armor. The fracture toughness of the optimal NMA composite is more than three times that of commercial Al2O3 ceramic. Simultaneously, the NMA composites have obvious advantages in terms of impact resistance compared with Al2O3 ceramic and polymer polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA). Additionally, the hierarchical structure of the NMA composites provides favorable structural conditions for transmission of electromagnetic (EM) waves at the frequency band of 18&#8211;26.5&#160;GHz. These characteristics make the NMA composites potential protective materials for radar and communication equipment.

MnBi2nTe3n+1 is a representative family of intrinsic magnetic topological insulators, in which numerous exotic phenomena such as the quantum anomalous Hall effect are expected. The high&#8208;quality crystal growth and magnetism manipulation are the most essential processes. Here a modified chemical vapor transport method using a feedback&#8208;regulated strategy is developed, which provides the closed&#8208;loop control of growth temperature within &#177;&#160;0.1&#160;&#176;C. Single crystals of MnBi2Te4, MnBi4Te7, and MnBi6Te10 are obtained under different temperature intervals respectively, and show variable tunability on magnetism by finely tuning the growth temperatures. Specifically, the cold&#8208;end temperatures not only vary the strength of antiferromagnetic coupling in MnBi2Te4, but also induce magnetic ground state transitions from antiferromagnetism to ferromagnetism in MnBi4Te7 and MnBi6Te10. In MnBi2Te4 with optimized magnetism, quantized transport with Chern insulator state can be easily replicated. These results provide a systematic picture for the crystal growth and the rich magnetic tunability of MnBi2nTe3n+1 family, providing richer platforms for the related researches combining magnetism and topological physics.

         <title>Modulating Trapping in Low&#8208;Dimensional Lead&#8211;Tin Halides for Energy&#8208;Efficient Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Robust 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper lead&#8208;tin perovskites demonstrate exceptional resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate deposition, achieving a high accuracy of 90.1% in MNIST pattern recognition. Additionally, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content&#8208;addressable memory architecture, based on perovskite memristive devices, is proposed for neuromorphic applications, demonstrating ultralow energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit&#8722;1 per cell.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have drawn great attention for neuromorphic electronic devices in recent years, however, the toxicity of lead as well as the variability and energy consumption of operational devices still pose great challenges for further consideration of this material in neuromorphic computing applications. Here, a 2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) metal halides system of formulation BA2Pb0.5Sn0.5I4 (BA = n&#8208;butylammonium) is prepared that exhibits outstanding resistive switching memory performance after cesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) deposition. In particular, the device exhibits excellent switching characteristics (endurance of 5 &#215; 105 cycles, ON/OFF ratio &#8776;105) and achieves 90.1% accuracy on the MNIST dataset. More importantly, a novel energy&#8208;efficient content addressable memory (CAM) architecture building on perovskite memristive devices for neuromorphic applications, called nCAM, is proposed, which has a minimum energy consumption of &#8776;0.025 fJ&#160;bit/cell. A mechanism involving the manipulation of trapping states through Cs2CO3 deposition is proposed to explain the resistive switching behavior of the memristive device.

         <title>Shortwave Infrared Light Detection and Ranging Using Silver Telluride Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the performance of Ag&#8322;Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5 V, an LDR exceeding 150 dB, and a rapid response speed of &#8776;25 ns. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a nanosecond diode laser, achieves decimetre&#8208;level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m, paving the way in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.








Abstract
Shortwave infrared (SWIR) light, characterized as the &#8220;eye&#8208;safe&#8221; window, is considered extremely promising in various technological fields and particularly valuable for imaging and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) applications. Silver telluride (Ag2Te) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs), featuring RoHS&#8208;compliance, solution&#8208;processability, and CMOS compatibility, emerge as a potential contender for SWIR optoelectronics. Yet, further improvements in dark current, response speed, and linear dynamic range (LDR) are essential for meeting the rigorous demands of sensing and LiDAR applications. Here, it is shown that post&#8208;synthesis surface engineering and doping control significantly improve the dark current, response speed, and LDR of Ag&#8322;Te CQD photodiodes, achieving a low dark current of 450 nA&#160;cm&#8722;2 at &#8722;0.5&#160;V, an LDR exceeding 150&#160;dB, and a rapid response speed of &#8776;25&#160;ns. A proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept LiDAR demonstration in the SWIR using a practical nanosecond diode laser achieves decimetre&#8208;level resolution at a distance exceeding 10 m. This work represents a key step in advancing SWIR CQDs toward consumer electronics and automotive markets.

         <title>Proton Reservoir in Covalent Organic Framework Compensating Oxygen Reduction Reaction Enhances Hydrogen Peroxide Photosynthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The incorporation of hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH) as a proton reservoir into the covalent organic framework (COF)&#160;can compensate oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), and achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of COF without &#9472;OH, which elucidates the favorability mechanisms of regulating the internal proton transfer of COF with proton reservoir in the accelerated ORR progress.









Abstract
The water oxidation reaction (WOR) with sluggish kinetics usually fails to adequately furnish protons to oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which ultimately constrains the overall efficiency of photocatalytic synthesis of H2O2, particularly in the absence of sacrificial agents. Herein, a class of hydroxyl groups (&#9472;OH) functionalized covalent organic framework (COF) is reported as a proton reservoir to compensate ORR for greatly improving the efficiency of H2O2 photosynthesis. It has been demonstrated that the incorporation of &#9472;OH into the TFBP&#8208;DHBD (TFBP: 1,2,4,5&#8208;tetrakis&#8208;(4&#8208;formylphenyl)benzene, DHBD: 3,3&#8242;&#8208;dihydroxybenzidine) COF can achieve a 3.3 times higher H2O2 photosynthetic activity than that of TFBP&#8208;BD (BD: benzidine) COF without &#9472;OH groups. Isotope labeling experiments and in situ infrared spectroscopy analysis demonstrate that the proton reservoir can donate protons for ORR and subsequently regain the released protons from WOR. Theoretical calculations further confirm that the &#9472;OH functionalized COF provides the protons for the formation of *OOH intermediate and reduces its energy barrier, thereby facilitating the photosynthesis of H2O2. A novel COF loaded with Al2O3 spheres&#8208;based streamlined microreactor is built that can simultaneously achieve production of H2O2 and elimination of bacteria over 1.3&#160;&#215;&#160;104 CFU mL&#8722;1, superior to the reported continuous flow photocatalytic reactors.

         <title>Boosting Leaching of Spent Ternary Cathode via Strong Van Der Waals Force Beyond Hydrogen Bonding</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, a novel design strategy is proposed by strengthening the van der Waals forces in the nanostructure of DESs, which significantly enhances the reducibility of DESs components. Benefiting from this, the leaching kinetics of metals is greatly improved, resulting in an excellent leaching performance that far exceeds previous reports.








Abstract
Promoting the green and efficient recycling of critical metals in spent ternary batteries represents a crucial step in driving the reduce of resource dependence in the electric vehicle industry. However, the leaching progress of metals from spent cathodes generally requires high reaction temperatures and large usage of solvents. Herein, a strategy is proposed to strengthen the van der Waals forces between solvent components by constructing affinity interactions between functional groups (e.g., &#8208;OH and &#8208;COOH), which can significantly enhance the leaching kinetics of metals at a high solid&#8208;liquid ratio and low temperature (30&#160;&#176;C). The results demonstrate that the strong van der Waals force between ascorbic acid with &#8208;OH group and betaine ions with &#8208;COOH group can strengthen the nucleophilicity of the carbon atoms and reduce the specific C&#9472;C bond energy, thus enhancing the redox capability of the DESs. Encouragingly, the designed solvent shows an impressive leaching performance at a super high S/L ratio (1: 3) without external heating for the actual black mass under a scaled&#8208;up experiment.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, a novel design strategy is proposed by strengthening the van der Waals forces in the nanostructure of DESs, which significantly enhances the reducibility of DESs components. Benefiting from this, the leaching kinetics of metals is greatly improved, resulting in an excellent leaching performance that far exceeds previous reports.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Promoting the green and efficient recycling of critical metals in spent ternary batteries represents a crucial step in driving the reduce of resource dependence in the electric vehicle industry. However, the leaching progress of metals from spent cathodes generally requires high reaction temperatures and large usage of solvents. Herein, a strategy is proposed to strengthen the van der Waals forces between solvent components by constructing affinity interactions between functional groups (e.g., -OH and -COOH), which can significantly enhance the leaching kinetics of metals at a high solid-liquid ratio and low temperature (30&#160;&#176;C). The results demonstrate that the strong van der Waals force between ascorbic acid with -OH group and betaine ions with -COOH group can strengthen the nucleophilicity of the carbon atoms and reduce the specific C&#9472;C bond energy, thus enhancing the redox capability of the DESs. Encouragingly, the designed solvent shows an impressive leaching performance at a super high S/L ratio (1: 3) without external heating for the actual black mass under a scaled-up experiment.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Enhanced Lithium&#8208;Ion Battery Electrodes with Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Additives Featuring Undercoordinated Zr4+ Sites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), which simultaneously boost lithium&#8208;ion conduction within electrodes and deliver step&#8208;change electrochemical performances. Such a cost&#8208;effectiveness MOF additive approach illuminates a new avenue toward advancing industry&#8208;relevant LIBs.








Abstract
Performances of lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are dictated by processes of electron&#8208;ion separation, transfers, and combination. While carbon additives are routinely used to ensure electronic conductivity, additives capable of simultaneously boosting ion conduction and delivering step&#8208;change performance remain elusive. Herein, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) possessing coordinately unsaturated Zr4+ sites are exploited as a new material library of electrode additives. The MOFs imbue infused electrolytes with an expanded electrochemical stability window (0 to 5&#160;V vs Li/Li&#8314;) and enhanced Li&#8314; transport efficiency. Mechanistically, strong interactions between Zr4+ sites and Li+ solvation sheaths result in trimmed, anion&#8208;fixed, and solvent&#8208;separated ion pairs, mitigating electrostatic coupling and enabling efficient Li&#8314; translocation in the porous nanospace. Concomitantly, these solvation structural modulations foster interfacial and electrochemical stabilities. When implemented at 1.7 wt.% in graphite and sub&#8208;Ah full cell, the MOF additives significantly improved Li+ diffusional kinetic, rate capability beyond 2C, and cycling longevity doubling lifespan. This work offers a straightforward yet effective route to remedy the bottlenecks of industrial LIBs.

A facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent strategy is developed to fabricate dendritic ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D with tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. The reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating capability lead to significantly improved performance in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis, highlighting the multifunctional potential of ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D.









Abstract
Metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs) are highly versatile materials with tunable chemical and structural properties, making them promising for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) and electrocatalysis. However, achieving precise control over MOF coordination structures to optimize facet&#8208;dependent properties remains challenging. Here, a facile and scalable dual&#8208;solvent synthesis strategy is presented to fabricate dendrite Co&#8208;2&#8208;methylimidazole MOF (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D), enabling tailored preferred facet and coordination environments. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations and synchrotron&#8208;based X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, it is demonstrated that ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D, enriched with (112) facets, features a reduced Co coordination number and enhanced electron&#8208;donating ability compared to the conventionally (011) facet&#8208;dominated rhombic dodecahedron ZIF&#8208;67 (ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;R). This facet engineering boosts TENG charge density by 2.4&#8208;fold, OER current density by 9.9&#8208;fold (@1.65&#160;V), and HER current density by 1.9&#8208;fold (@&#8208;0.3&#160;V). The (112)/(011) facet ratio can be also tuned to precisely alter TENG output. Moreover, the optimized ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D shows excellent stability, maintaining electrolyzer performance for 72&#160;h and enabling TENG devices even in high humidity. Consequently, ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D&#8208;based TENG (D&#8208;TENG) devices exhibit robust energy generation and power ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D||ZIF&#8208;67&#8208;D electrolyzers for continuous hydrogen (H2) production. These findings introduce a new paradigm for converting mechanical energy into sustainable chemical energy, offering insights into facet engineering for high&#8208;performance energy harvesting systems.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel 3D template&#8208;catalyzed growth (3D&#8208;TCG) method is developed for kilogram&#8208;scale production of few&#8208;layered 2D nanosheet powders with high efficiency. The template&#8208;catalyzed growth mechanism of this approach enables the high&#8208;quality and controllable lateral sizes from 100&#160;nm to 10&#160;&#181;m of the products, demonstrating promising viability for large&#8208;scale practical applications.








Abstract
Bulk availability of 2D material powders presents broad opportunities for various industrial applications. Particle size and morphology control are critical factors that govern their properties, and in particular, large&#8208;scale size&#8208;controlled production of 2D materials nanosheets remains extremely challenging. Herein, a novel 3D template&#8208;catalyzed growth (3D&#8208;TCG) method is demonstrated that allows the mass production of size&#8208;tunable 2D hexagonal boron nitride (h&#8208;BN) nanosheet powders, a key material in the 2D materials family. Rather than limiting the nanosheet growth on 2D substrate surfaces, this method provides large numbers of active sites distributed in 3D space, leading to the feasibility of scale&#8208;up production with excellent product homogeneity and high efficiency. Ultrathin h&#8208;BN nanosheets are synthesized with high throughput (kilogram quantities) and lateral sizes that can be tuned from 100&#160;nm to 10&#160;&#181;m with thicknesses of few layers. Their practical application is demonstrated in lithium metal batteries, where the obtained nanosheet powders are processed and roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll coated on commercial separators (&gt;10 m2). The prototype pouch cell delivers high energy density (501.8&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1) and improved cycling stability. The template&#8208;based large&#8208;scale production strategy can be used to generically produce various types of bulk pristine 2D nanopowders with potential for many large&#8208;scale applications.

         <title>Porous CuBi2O4 Photocathode with Intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ Redox Improves Solar C(sp3)&#8208;H Bond Conversion Efficiency by an Order of Magnitude</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Selective C&#8208;H activation is a crucial step in organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals&#8208;driven C&#8208;H activation is considered a promising approach but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad&#8208;band gap semiconductors. A half&#8208;photocathodic reaction strategy is reported for the selective oxidation of toluene to benzaldehyde using a narrow&#8208;bandgap porous CuBi2O4 photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CuBi2O4 catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reduction, generating H2O2&#8208;derived &#183;OH radicals that activate the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond, followed by &#183;O2&#8208;&#8208;mediated oxidation to yield benzaldehyde.








Abstract
Selective C&#8208;H activation is the most important step for organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals driven C&#8208;H activation is considered a promising route but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad&#8208;band gap semiconductors. Herein, a half&#8208;photocathodic reaction strategy is demonstrated to activate and oxygenate C(sp3)&#8208;H bonds of toluene toward selective benzaldehyde production using a narrow&#8208;bandgap CuBi2O4 (CBO) porous photocathode. The intrinsic Cu+/Cu2+ redox of porous CBO photocathode catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reductive H2O2 to generate &#183;OH capable of oxidation which activates the C(sp3)&#8208;H bond that is further oxygenated via &#183;O2&#8722; formed of the photocathodic oxygen reduction. As a result, the benzaldehyde selectivity is up to 90%. Impressively, the narrow&#8208;band gap of CBO enables record&#8208;high light&#8208;driven benzaldehyde yields of 111.93&#160;mmol&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 with stability of over 20 h. This work opens a green and efficient light&#8208;driven C(sp3)&#8208;H bond oxidation strategy by using a narrow&#8208;bandgap photocathode.

The intrinsic Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; redox of porous CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reduction, generating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-derived &#183;OH radicals that activate the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bond, followed by &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;-mediated oxidation to yield benzaldehyde.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Selective C-H activation is the most important step for organic molecule transformation. Photocatalytic radicals driven C-H activation is considered a promising route but suffers from simultaneously utilizing electron/hole pairs which are limited to broad-band gap semiconductors. Herein, a half-photocathodic reaction strategy is demonstrated to activate and oxygenate C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bonds of toluene toward selective benzaldehyde production using a narrow-bandgap CuBi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (CBO) porous photocathode. The intrinsic Cu&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; redox of porous CBO photocathode catalyzes the photocathodic oxygen reductive H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to generate &#183;OH capable of oxidation which activates the C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bond that is further oxygenated via &#183;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; formed of the photocathodic oxygen reduction. As a result, the benzaldehyde selectivity is up to 90%. Impressively, the narrow-band gap of CBO enables record-high light-driven benzaldehyde yields of 111.93&#160;mmol&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; with stability of over 20 h. This work opens a green and efficient light-driven C(sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;)-H bond oxidation strategy by using a narrow-bandgap photocathode.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Molecular Design of Electron&#8208;Rich Polyoxometalates Based Clusters Enabling Intelligent Energy Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An electron&#8208;rich &#603;&#8208;Keggin cluster CuMo16 is synthesized and can act as an active material is introduced into a hydrogel system for intelligent electronics. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that integrating CuMo16 significantly enhances the intelligent storage performance of flexible electronics, and molecular regulation of CuMo16 content provides an effective strategy for optimizing flexible electronic devices.








Abstract
The fabrication of molecular cluster&#8208;based intelligent energy storage systems remains a significant challenge due to the intricacies of multifunctional integration at the molecular level. In this work, low&#8208;valent metal atoms are successfully encapsulated within &#603;&#8208;type Keggin structures, yielding a novel cluster denoted as CuMo16. This unique structure displayed the characteristic &#8220;molybdenum red&#8221; coloration, with a high degree of reduction (76.47%), which played a pivotal role in enhancing its electrochemical properties. The specialized configuration significantly enhanced multi&#8208;proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer kinetics, enabling efficient and rapid electron storage and release, with up to thirteen electrons per molecule. To construct an intelligent energy storage device, CuMo16 is employed as a proton&#8208;coupled electron&#8208;active material and embedded within a polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) matrix, resulting in the flexible, wearable, rechargeable devices. The flexible electronics not only demonstrate real&#8208;time human motion detection but also exhibit remarkable energy storage performance, reaching a peak capacity of 194.19 mAh g&#8722;1 and maintaining 68.2% capacity retention after 2500 cycles. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal that integrating CuMo16 significantly enhances the intelligent storage performance of flexible electronics, and molecular regulation of CuMo16 content provides an effective strategy for optimizing flexible electronic devices. This study lays the foundation for the development of cluster&#8208;based intelligent energy storage systems.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Segregated Solid Polymer Electrolytes for High&#8208;Rate Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work introduces a salt&#8208;segregation strategy for solid polymer electrolytes, which decouples surface and bulk salt distribution to form an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The design dramatically enhances the lithium deposition kinetics and suppresses parasitic reactions, empowering Li||LiFePO4 solid&#8208;state batteries with exceptional cycling over 20&#160;000 cycles at high&#8208;rate of 1.12&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Solid&#8208;polymer electrolytes (SPEs) demonstrate great potential for solid&#8208;state lithium batteries (SSLBs), however, interfacial instability and sluggish ion transport at the interface critically hinder their high&#8208;rate capability and long&#8208;term stability. Here, a novel salt&#8208;segregation methodology with spatial salt grade for SPEs is introduced. This approach leverages the differential solubility of lithium salts and PVDF matrix in a commercially available fluoroethylene carbonate during fabrication, which drives the formation of an ion&#8208;enriched surface layer. The strategy simultaneously enhances interfacial and bulk ionic conductivity while effectively mitigating parasitic reactions. These advancements optimize Li+ flux at the lithium metal interphase, promoting a spherical Li growth with minimized surface area and leading to dense lithium deposition. Consequently, the engineered SPE achieves a remarkable cycling of 500&#160;h in Li||Li cells at 2&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2. Solid&#8208;state Li||LiFePO4 cells exhibit a record stability for 20&#160;000 cycles at 1.12 A&#160;g&#8722;1 (2&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2 LiFePO4 cathode), and a high capacity of 147&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 over 300 cycles at 0.84&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under a high&#8208;loading 2&#160;mAh&#160;cm&#8722;2 cathode. The strategy addresses interfacial limitations in SPEs and further introduces a paradigm shift by emphasizing the critical role of spatial salt&#8208;graded engineering at the surface over uniform ion distribution for stabilizing high&#8208;rate SSLBs.
