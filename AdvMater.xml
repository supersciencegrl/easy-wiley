         <title>Mitigating Mobile&#8208;Ion&#8208;Induced Instabilities and Performance Losses in 2D Passivated Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study addresses the challenges of mobile&#8208;ion&#8208;induced instability in perovskite solar cells. Introducing bilayer passivation with ammonium salts (EDAI&#8322;/PEAI and ABS/PEAI) significantly reduces ion density and improves device stability. The approach mitigates the detrimental effects of PEAI&#8208;induced ionic losses, enhancing both performance and operational lifetime under continuous illumination.








Abstract
Bulky ammonium salt&#8208;based passivation is an effective strategy for enhancing the performance and stability of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Especially, phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) is known to greatly improve open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) and fill factor (FF). Despite these benefits, PEAI passivation leads to substantial short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) losses and rapid degradation under operational conditions. In this work, it is revealed that the&#160;JSC loss as well as the accelerated degradation in PEAI&#8208;passivated devices is caused by an increased mobile ion density. To mitigate this performance and stability&#8208;limiting mechanism, ultrathin layers of ammonium benzenesulfonate (ABS) and/or ethylenediammonium diiodide (EDAI2) salts are then introduced between the PEAI and the perovskite, which stabilize the 2D perovskite layer and impede diffusion even under upon prolonged illumination. This leads to a reduced mobile ion density both in fresh devices and in the long term, lowering losses&#160;JSC, and thus enables power conversion efficiencies of &#8776;25% with enhanced stability. Overall, this study not only addresses the limitations of PEAI&#8208;based 2D passivation but also paves the way for understanding 2D&#8208;induced ionic&#160;JSC losses.

         <title>Control of Chemical Doping&#8208;Mediated Space Charge for Energetic Band&#8208;Switching Modulation in Low&#8208;Noise Shortwave&#8208;Infrared Organic Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study investigates chemical doping effects on spatial charge distributions in SWIR organic photodetectors (OPDs). Defect control through doping concentration enables energetic band modulation, reducing dark current and lowering noise&#8208;equivalent power to pico&#8208;scale levels. The findings advance low&#8208;noise SWIR OPDs, highlighting spatial defect engineering as a key strategy for improving carrier dynamics and device performance.








Abstract
This study investigates the influence of chemical doping on the spatial&#8208;charge distributions and carrier&#8208;tunneling mechanisms in single&#8208;polymer shortwave&#8208;infrared (SWIR) photomultiplication (PM)&#8208;organic photodetectors (OPDs). By systematically analyzing the optical and photoelectric properties influenced by chemical doping, it is identified that dopant&#8208;induced defects as space charges significantly contribute to Fowler&#8211;Nordheim (FN) tunneling, thereby impacting the performance of SWIR OPDs. At a doping concentration of 0.5&#160;mm, the formation of positively charged carriers (polarons and/or bipolarons) within the polymer matrix initiates, thereby facilitating SWIR absorption and contributing to the balance between photocurrent and noise by mitigating FN tunneling through the reduction of defect density (ND). However, as the doping concentration exceeds 5&#160;mm, the increased ND accumulates more space charge, accelerating FN tunneling. This enhances photocurrent generation and amplifies noise disproportionately, ultimately limiting OPD performance. Under ND&#8208;minimized optimum doping concentration (at 0.5&#160;mm), the OPD exhibited a noise equivalent power of 9.85 pW (at &#8722;8&#160;V, bandwidth = 1&#160;Hz, and wavelength = 1490&#160;nm), and a linear dynamic range of 42&#160;dB. These findings demonstrate the role of chemical doping in enhancing the performance of SWIR PM&#8208;OPDs, paving the way for advanced photonic sensors.

         <title>Mechanochromic, Low&#8208;Cost, and Structurally Colored Displays Using Biodegradable Hydroxypropyl Cellulose</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanochromic hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) integrated with microfluidic devices creates scalable, eco&#8208;friendly reflective color displays. We demonstrate mechanochromic displays with 500 &#181;m pixel size and 5Hz switching rates with room for optimisation. The proposed mechanochromic HPC displays are an initial step toward more environmentally responsible color display and pixel technologies.








Abstract
Mechanochromic materials have garnered significant interest over the past decade due to their ability to change color in response to mechanical cues. While it is known that hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) self&#8208;assembles into biodegradable and low&#8208;cost mechanochromic materials, with a wide range of applications from edible colorants to optical strain sensors, mechanochromic HPC displays themselves are not reported. Here we address this challenge by combining thin mechanochromic HPC films with microfluidic arrays of inflatable microactuators that exert controlled forces. With these devices, the mechanochromic strain sensitivity, color resolution, response times, and operating frequencies of photonic aqueous HPC films are measured at decreasing length scales for the first time. Various pixel sizes, geometry, and input frequencies are also assessed to investigate mechanochromic HPC as a potential low&#8208;cost, biodegradable display. Potential applications range from dynamic color pixels for soft robotics to more environmentally responsible RGB display technology.

         <title>Biomimetic Hybrid PROTAC Nanovesicles Block Multiple DNA Repair Pathways to Overcome Temozolomide Resistance Against Orthotopic Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic nanotechnology, drug delivery, glioblastoma, PROTAC, temozolomide resistance. A biomimetic PROTAC nanovesicle (M@TP) combining temozolomide (TMZ) with GSH&#8208;activatable prodrug (PC&#8208;ss&#8208;Pro) has been developed, which can penetrate the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and target glioblastoma (GBM) through homotypic recognition, and restore sensitivity to TMZ by inducing BRD4 degradation. M@TP effectively inhibits the growth of TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM and postoperative GBM, offering a feasible strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve the prognosis of GBM.








Abstract
Glioblastoma (GBM) remains one of the deadliest forms of cancer due to its high rates of postoperative recurrence and resistance to treatment. Temozolomide (TMZ) is the standard chemotherapy for GBM. However, the therapeutic efficacy of TMZ is significantly compromised by the activation of various intracellular DNA repair mechanisms that facilitate TMZ resistance. Herein, the upregulation of bromodomain&#8208;containing protein 4 (BRD4) expression is demonstrated to be a key contributor to TMZ resistance in GBM. To address this challenge, a biomimetic hybrid PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTAC) liposome delivery system (M@TP) is developed. This system efficiently penetrates the blood&#8208;brain barrier (BBB) and specifically targets GBM cells through homotypic recognition. Once within TMZ&#8208;resistant GBM cells, the released PROTAC from M@TP can specifically degrade BRD4, effectively inhibiting multiple DNA repair pathways and restoring sensitivity to TMZ treatment. In vivo, studies showed that M@TP demonstrated significant efficacy in suppressing tumor growth in both TMZ&#8208;resistant and postoperative GBM, with prolonged mouse survival times. These findings highlight the potential of M@TP as a promising strategy to overcome TMZ resistance and improve therapeutic outcomes in GBM.

         <title>3D Printing of Ultrahigh Filler Content Composites Enabled by Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for directly printing ultrahigh filler content composites is presented, whereby granular hydrogels are incorporated into rigid filler particle flow, leading to polymer&#8208;based composites with a filler content of up to 99.2&#160;wt.%. Granular hydrogels weaken the stability of arches through elastic deformation, thus mitigating clogging caused by bridging. This strategy offers a promising route for manufacturing 3D composites with exceptionally high filler content.

Ultrahigh filler content composites have exhibited distinctive properties in various areas, such as structural materials, electrical insulation, thermal management, and energy storage devices. However, manufacturing 3D composites with ultrahigh filler content is challenging because excessive fillers have compromised the processing flowability of the composite. Here, using hollow glass microspheres (HGMs) as an example filler, a 3D printing strategy for fabricating particulate composites with ultrahigh HGM content (up to 99.2&#160;wt.%) is reported. By incorporating the highly swollen granular hydrogel as the shear sliding phase between HGMs, the probability of clogging during extrusion of the composite ink with ultrahigh HGM content is substantially reduced. A quantitative phase diagram is developed to optimally choose the ink compositions with the maximum HGM content, as well as printing parameters. The resulting composite with ultrahigh HGM content shows ceramic&#8208;foam&#8208;like brittle fracture behavior, high wave&#8208;transparent properties (0.996), and low thermal conductivity (0.045&#160;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;1). Further, a thermal shield with high HGM content on a microcircuit board to validate the localized thermal protection is fabricated. It is believed that incorporating hydrogel matrix into the printing ink will unlock the capabilities of 3D printed ultrahigh filler content composites in creating more intricate structures with advanced functionalities.

&lt;p&gt;A strategy for directly printing ultrahigh filler content composites is presented, whereby granular hydrogels are incorporated into rigid filler particle flow, leading to polymer-based composites with a filler content of up to 99.2&#160;wt.%. Granular hydrogels weaken the stability of arches through elastic deformation, thus mitigating clogging caused by bridging. This strategy offers a promising route for manufacturing 3D composites with exceptionally high filler content.

         <title>Heat&#8208;Triggered Dynamic Self&#8208;Healing Framework for Variable&#8208;Temperature Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is developed to repair defects at grain boundaries, improving temperature stability in PSCs. HDSF, mainly located at the grain boundaries, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and relieves crystal stress through dynamic sulfide bond exchange. This approach led to a PCE of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with enhanced thermal stability.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising as the next&#8208;generation photovoltaic technology. However, the inferior stability under various temperatures remains a significant obstacle to commercialization. Here, a heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing framework (HDSF) is implemented to repair defects at grain boundaries caused by thermal variability, enhancing PSCs' temperature stability. HDSF, distributed at the grain boundaries and surface of the perovskite film, stabilizes the perovskite lattice and releases the perovskite crystal stress through the dynamic exchange reaction of sulfide bonds. The resultant PSCs achieved a power&#8208;conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.32% (certified 25.84%) with elevated temperature stability, retaining 88.7% of the initial PCE after 1000 h at 85&#160;&#176;C. In a variable temperature cycling test (between &#8722;40 and 80&#160;&#176;C), the HDSF&#8208;treated device retained 87.6% of its initial PCE at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and 92.6% at 80&#160;&#176;C after 160 thermal cycles. This heat&#8208;triggered dynamic self&#8208;healing strategy could significantly enhance the reliability of PSCs in application scenarios.

         <title>Mechanostimulatory Platform for Improved CAR T Cell Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel T&#8208;cell mechanostimulatory platform with controlled elasticity and nanotopography optimize T&#8208;cell activation by reducing T&#8208;cell exhaustion and enhancing central memory T&#8208;cell differentiation. This platform is utilized for the generation of Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cells, demonstrating improved antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo and in vivo studies.








Abstract
Chimeric Antigen Receptor T (CAR T) cell immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment, yet it is hindered by rapid T&#8208;cell exhaustion caused by uncontrolled activation during CAR generation. Leveraging insights into T&#8208;cell mechanosensing, a novel mechanostimulatory platform is engineered for T&#8208;cell activation based on an antigen&#8208;carrying surface with controlled elasticity and nanotopography. The platform is designed to optimize and balance T&#8208;cell exhaustion, proliferation, and CAR expression. It enhances the differentiation of T cells into the central memory subset, which is crucial for the persistence of CAR T cell therapy's anticancer effects. The platform produces CAR T cells with higher antitumor efficacy, as validated through ex vivo experiments, and with higher in vivo persistence and ability to suppress tumor proliferation, as compared to CAR T cells generated by standard protocols. RNA&#8208;seq analysis confirmed an increased transcriptional signature of central memory T cells. Furthermore, this platform completely eliminates T&#8208;cell toxicity associated with the non&#8208;viral transfection process typically observed with standard activation methods. This platform presents a promising pathway for improving the efficiency and safety of CAR T cell therapy.

         <title>A Highly Adaptable Hydrogen Bond Re&#8208;Orientation (HyBRO) Strategy for Multiscale Vasculature Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy enables three&#8208;dimensional (3D) printing of vascular microchannel networks with high accuracy. By switching sacrificial material interactions with nonsolvents, HyBRO prevents swelling and deformation, enabling accurate hierarchical channels spanning a tenfold size range. The method accommodates diverse ink materials and produces vasculature exhibiting robust endothelial barrier function and ion&#8208;channel responses under shear stress.








Abstract
Three&#8208;dimensional&#160;printing of microchannel networks mimicking native vasculature provides essential functions for biomedical applications. However, developing a highly &#8220;adaptable&#8221; technique &#8211; that can adjust to diverse materials choices, high shape accuracy, and broad size ranges &#8211; for producing physiologically responsive vasculature remains challenging. Here, an innovative hydrogen bond re&#8208;orientation (HyBRO) strategy for microchannel network fabrication is reported. By identifying interfacial instability of sacrificial material (SM) during embedding as a core limitation, this strategy prints the SM into an optimal &#8220;nonsolvent&#8221; to shape the desirable channel structure. In this process, the nonsolvent instantaneously switches the SM from forming hydrogen bonds with exterior water to forming interior linkages inside it. This transition protects the SM from external solvent &#8220;erosion&#8221; upon re&#8208;exposure to embedding material, inhibiting deformation. Consequently, this approach enables the creation of accurate (&gt;90%), multiscale (10&#8208;fold), hierarchical microchannel networks, accommodating accurate printing of a wide range of ink materials &#8211; extending from typical hydrophilic polymers into non&#8208;typical hydrophobic ones. Further biological tests demonstrate that HyBRO&#8208;produced vasculature recapitulates not only essential endothelial barrier function but also delicate ion&#8208;channel responses to varying shear stresses, highlighting its potential for engineering physiologically responsive vasculature in broad applications.

         <title>Tailoring Cold&#8208;Resilient Electrolytes Driven by Mechanisms Underlying Ice Melting for Cryogenic Zn Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, a fresh perspective from mechanisms of chemical ice melting identifies key criteria influencing the selection of effective solutes for the development of more reliable cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes. The screened ice&#8208;melting chemical potassium formate effectively enables the realization of ultra&#8208;stable reversibility in a low&#8208;temperature environment.








Abstract
The freezing and melting behaviors of aqueous solutions are strongly influenced by the presence of chemical substances, yet the criteria for screening effective chemicals remain poorly defined. This study introduces a novel perspective to designing cold&#8208;resilient electrolytes by focusing on the mechanisms underlying ice melting and identifying the key screening criteria, providing new insights into how specific chemicals can enhance the cryogenic properties of aqueous solutions. A series of theoretical and experimental tools highlight its superior low&#8208;temperature tolerance endowed by the screened chemical solute, and the pouch full cell Zn//pyrene&#8208;4,5,9,10&#8208;tetraone with cathode loading up to 7.5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 delivers an impressively high capacity of 110 mAh g&#8722;1 and excellent rate performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This special work would enrich the design concepts and expand the paradigms of developing water&#8208;based energy storage systems in extreme environments.

This study introduces a novel perspective to designing cold-resilient electrolytes by focusing on the mechanisms underlying ice melting and identifying the key screening criteria, providing new insights into how specific chemicals can enhance the cryogenic properties of aqueous solutions. A series of theoretical and experimental tools highlight its superior low-temperature tolerance endowed by the screened chemical solute, and the pouch full cell Zn//pyrene-4,5,9,10-tetraone with cathode loading up to 7.5&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; delivers an impressively high capacity of 110 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and excellent rate performance at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C. This special work would enrich the design concepts and expand the paradigms of developing water-based energy storage systems in extreme environments.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Acoustic Moir&#233; Flat Bands in Twisted Heterobilayer Metasurface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research proposes a heterobilayer moir&#233; acoustic metasurface using two distinct lattice structures. The heterobilayer design contributes to divergent dispersion curves for the upper and lower layers and allows for greater flexibility in tuning their hybridization through interlayer twisting. This metasurface enables tunable magic angles and topological states, significantly broadening the potential applications of acoustic wave manipulation.








Abstract
Twisted bilayer systems enable a fundamental platform for engineering novel physical phenomena, such as topological phase transitions, polaritons, flat bands, and superconductivity. However, previous reports mainly focused on homobilayer structures, where each layer has identical configurations. In this work, a twisted heterobilayer (tHB) metasurface with strong anisotropy is presented. It is shown that hybridizing the dispersion curves of two different profiles significantly enhances the application potential of bilayer structures. It is observed that when two stacked heterogeneous metasurfaces are rotated to a specific angle, a topological phase transition occurs, which is accompanied by hyperbolic to elliptical wave propagation characteristics. At a specific &#8220;magic angle&#8221;, the dispersion curves of the two layers merge into a flat band with drastically reduced diffraction, enabling sound waves to propagate with minimal energy dissipation. Furthermore, the performance of the tHB system is robust to defects or disorders, manifested by minimal changes before and after introducing line defects into the layers. Our findings overcome the limitations of homogeneous metasurface and provide new ideas for controlling sound&#8208;material interactions.

         <title>Strain Gradient Induced Skyrmion in a van der Waals Magnet by Wrinkling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2 enables field&#8208;free skyrmion generation via wrinkling&#8208;induced deformation. The opposing in&#8208;plane strain gradients across the wrinkle's peak/valley drive asymmetric domain evolution: skyrmion nucleation occurs on one flank while labyrinthine domain patterns persist on the counterpart. This asymmetry originates from strain&#8208;gradient&#8208;mediated differential modulation of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction.








Abstract
Magnetic structures are profoundly influenced by mechanical deformation. In particular, strain has been employed to achieve the reconstruction of magnetic domains, paving a mechanical pathway to manipulate magnetic domains. However, experimentally applied strains typically exhibit non&#8208;uniform distributions. Therefore, how to distinguish the role of non&#8208;uniform strains (strain gradients) and uniform strains is crucial for understanding the mechanical manipulation of magnetic structures. Here, by directly comparing to strain tuning, it is revealed that strain gradient induced by mechanical wrinkles is critical for magnetic domain manipulation in van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GaTe2. A ground&#8208;state labyrinthine domain transforms into a skyrmion state in the presence of an in&#8208;plane strain gradient. Additionally, an asymmetric evolutionary behavior of the magnetic domain occurs on both sides of wrinkle peaks. Theoretical simulations uncover that though opposite in&#8208;plane strain gradient hosts C2 rotational symmetry, this asymmetric domain evolution can be achieved through the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interaction. The finding highlights the vital role of strain gradient in manipulating magnetic properties, and also offers a new mechanism for generating field&#8208;free skyrmion.

         <title>Halide Perovskite Photocatalysts for Clean Fuel Production and Organic Synthesis: Opportunities and Challenges</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review provides the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art overview of halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts for hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and organic chemical transformations. Different types of halide perovskite photocatalysts and their relative efficiencies for hydrogen generation and CO2 reduction, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents and outstanding challenges are discussed.








Abstract
The need to constrain the use of fossil fuels causing global warming is motivating the development of a variety of photocatalysts for solar&#8208;to&#8208;fuel generation and chemical synthesis. In particular, semiconductor&#8208;based photocatalysts have been extensively exploited in solar&#8208;driven organic synthesis, carbon dioxide (CO2) conversion into value&#8208;added products, and hydrogen (H2) generation from water (H2O) splitting. Recently, metal halide perovskites (MHPs) have emerged as an important class of semiconductors for heterogeneous photocatalysis owing to their interesting properties. Despite key issues with long&#8208;term stability and degradation in polar solvents due to their ionic character, there has been significant progress in halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts with improving their stability and performance in the gas and liquid phases. This review discusses the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art for using halide perovskite&#8208;based photocatalysts and photoelectrocatalysis in hydrogen production from water and halogen acid solutions, CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added chemicals, and various organic chemical transformations. The different types of halide perovskites used, design strategies to overcome the instability issues in polar solvents, and the efficiencies achieved are discussed. Furthermore, the outstanding challenges associated with the use of polar electrolytes and how the stability and performance can be improved are discussed.

         <title>Dual Active Site Engineering in Porous NiW Bimetallic Alloys for Enhanced Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A porous NiW bimetallic alloy with dual active site engineering is reported as an efficient electrocatalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction. The alloying of Ni with W enhances H2O dissociation and *OH desorption at the W site, while also facilitating the generation of more available H* intermediates at the Ni2W1 hollow site, thereby improving the hydrogen evolution activity of the porous NiW bimetallic alloy. Notably, a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen conversion efficiency of 16.59% is achieved in a NiW&#8208;incorporated solar&#8208;driven water splitting system.








Abstract
Utilizing dual active sites in electrocatalysts creates a synergistic effect, enabling the independent optimization of H2O dissociation and intermediate adsorption/desorption, which in turn enhances the efficiency of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, a porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst using a dynamic H2 bubble template (DHBT) strategy is fabricated. This electrocatalyst capitalizes on the synergistic effect of dual active sites, achieving industrial&#8208;level current densities of 500 and 1000&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for HER in 1.0&#160;M KOH, with low overpotentials of 198 and 264&#160;mV, respectively. It also demonstrates excellent stability over a 200&#160;h test. Theoretical studies reveal that alloying Ni with W shifts the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of the W 5d orbital downward, which enhances *OH intermediate desorption and promotes H2O adsorption and dissociation at the W site, leading to increased active site availability. Meanwhile, this shift provides more accessible H* intermediates, further enhancing H2 production at the Ni2W1 hollow site. When the porous NiW bimetallic alloy electrocatalyst is implemented in a solar&#8208;driven water splitting system, it achieves a high solar&#8208;to&#8208;hydrogen (STH) conversion efficiency of 16.59%. This work underscores the effectiveness of dual active site electrocatalysts for sustainable H2 production.

         <title>Formation Mechanism and Molecular Structure of Sulfurized Polyacrylonitrile</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation mechanism of SPAN begins with the production of the S2 diradical, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of PAN, resulting in the formation of SPAN. Its molecular structure is multilayered, featuring two twisted layers (&#8776;30&#8211;40&#176;) interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds. This structure has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to 63.5 wt.% (&#8776;1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1).








Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries have attracted considerable attention due to their high theoretical energy density and abundant sulfur resources. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) effectively suppresses polysulfide dissolution and demonstrates excellent cycling stability, making it a promising candidate for cathode materials in practical Li&#8208;SPAN batteries. This study elucidates the formation mechanism, chemical bonds, and spatial structures of SPAN. The reaction begins with the generation of &#183;S2&#183; diradicals, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of polyacrylonitrile (PAN), ultimately resulting in the formation of C&#9472;S and N&#9472;S bonds. The multilayered structure of SPAN, characterized by C&#8208;S and N&#8208;S layers twisted at angles of &#8776;30 to 40 degrees and interconnected by C&#9472;Sx&#9472;N bonds, has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to a maximum of 63.5 wt.%, corresponding to a theoretical capacity exceeding 1000 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. These findings provide fundamental insights for the design of SPAN materials for advanced X&#8208;SPAN batteries.

&lt;p&gt;The formation mechanism of SPAN begins with the production of the S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; diradical, followed by the dehydrogenation and cyclization of PAN, resulting in the formation of SPAN. Its molecular structure is multilayered, featuring two twisted layers (&#8776;30&#8211;40&#176;) interconnected by C&#9472;S&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;&#9472;N bonds. This structure has the potential to chemically confine sulfur up to 63.5 wt.% (&#8776;1000 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Linear Annulation Engineering of Indolocarbazole Multiple Resonance Emitter to Overcome Efficiency&#8208;Stability&#8208;Color Purity Trilemma in Deep&#8208;Blue OLEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An indolocarbazole emitter employing a linear annulation strategy is developed, not only narrowing spectral bandwidth with redshifted emission through multiple resonance framework extension to afford ultrapure electroluminescence peaking at 458&#160;nm with full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum of 19&#160;nm, but also enhancing device longevity and efficiency with a long LT80 of 101&#160;h and high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3%.








Abstract
Deep&#8208;blue emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) still confront the critical challenge of balancing high efficiency, operational stability, and color purity, particularly for the ones with peak wavelengths (&#955;max) &#8804; 460&#160;nm. Here, the study demonstrates deep&#8208;blue devices featuring ultrapure emission (&#955;max = 458&#160;nm, full&#8208;width at half&#8208;maximum = 19&#160;nm), high maximum external quantum efficiency of 34.3% with small roll&#8208;off (26.9% at 1&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2; 20.9% at 5&#8201;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2), and long operational LT80 (time to 80% of the initial luminance) of 101 hours at 1,000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, being one of the longest lifetime among OLEDs with &#955;max &#8804; 460&#160;nm and EQE &gt;20%. This breakthrough stems from an indolocarbazole narrowband emitter employing a linear annulation strategy, which not only narrows spectral bandwidth while red&#8208;shifting emission peak through multiple resonance framework extension, but also energetically and dynamically enhances device longevity via triplet energy reduction. Furthermore, strategic integration of steric hindrance on the emitting backbone suppresses intermolecular interactions and directs reactivity pathways. This emitter concurrently achieves a &#955;max of 456&#160;nm, FWHM of 15&#160;nm and photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield of 98% in dilute toluene. The work highlights linear annulation engineering as a potential approach to resolve the efficiency&#8208;stability&#8208;color purity trilemma in deep&#8208;blue OLEDs.

         <title>Multifunctional Logic Gates via Coexistent Positive and Negative Photoconductivity of a Single Bi2Se3 Photodetector</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional optoelectronic logic gate is presented based on the coexistence of PPC (Positive Photoconductivity) and NPC(Negative Photoconductivity) in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs.








Abstract
Because existing electronic logic gates have some limitations in the era of information explosion, the demand for substantial amounts of data processing has aroused interest in new types of logic gates. The use of optoelectronic materials to prepare logic gates is popular; however, they often have complex structures, high power consumption, and low reliability. Herein, a new optoelectronic logic gate (OELG) is presented based on the coexistence of positive and negative photoconductivities in the 2D material Bi2Se3 at different wavelengths. Five logic gate signals (OR, AND, NOT, NOR, and NAND) can be modulated by inputting different wavelengths of light (405 and 808 nm) through a single Bi2Se3 photodetector, offering a new method for simple&#8208;structured OELGs. For practical applications, five logic gate output signals are modulated with 100% accuracy on an 8 &#215; 8 pixel array, and simple imaging and logical processing of the images are demonstrated.

         <title>A Self&#8208;Assembling Composite Structural Design for the Conversion of Hydroxyl&#8208;Anchored Bonds Obtains High Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

The detailed mechanisms governing the adsorption dynamics between SAMs and ITO delve into and promote homogeneous and stable SAMs film by converting the originally weak bonds anchored through physical interactions into strong bonds, helping PSCs achieve a high power conversion efficiency of 26.37%.








Abstract
Self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) serve as the hole&#8208;transporting layer (HTL) in perovskite solar cells, yet their instability on indium tin oxide (ITO) substrates poses a challenge in practical. The typical SAMs are susceptible to solvents during the perovskite layer deposition process which can result in being washed or dislodged, thereby impeding the formation of a dense SAM. Here, a novel guanidine&#8208;modified polyurethane siloxane elastomers is synthesized to enhance the anchoring capability of SAMs on ITO, which exhibits strong interactions with [2&#8208;(3,6&#8208;dimethoxy&#8208;9H&#8208;carbazol&#8208;9&#8208;yl)ethyl] phosphonic acid (MeO&#8208;2PACz) SAMs, to co&#8208;construct a self&#8208;assembled composite structure (SACS). By utilizing this anchor strategy, the weakly bonded MeO&#8208;2PACz adhering to ITO can be converted into a strongly bonded form, thereby curtailing the migration of MeO&#8208;2PACz on the ITO surface during the spin&#8208;coating process, as well as inhibiting shedding that may occur due to solvent washing during the device preparation process. SACS SAMs heighten the charge collection ability of SAMs and suppress interfacial recombination, as well as enhance the growth of the upper perovskite layer. Finally, the SACS&#8208;based SAMs device with a power conversion efficiency of 26.37%. The unencapsulated device based on SACS SAMs can be stored for at least 5000&#160;h with little degradation in performance.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Deep&#8208;Ultraviolet Photodetectors Based On Band Engineering and Ferroelectric Modulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Ga2O3&#8208;based deep&#8208;ultraviolet photodetectors achieve high&#8208;sensitivity detection under low operating voltage and ultraweak light intensity conditions, enabled by effective carrier separation and transport through BaTiO3 interlayer modulation.








Abstract
Wide bandgap semiconductors have emerged as a class of deep&#8208;ultraviolet sensitive materials, showing great potentials for next&#8208;generation integrated devices. Yet, to achieve a high photoresponse of deep&#8208;ultraviolet detector without complicated designs at low supply voltage and weak light intensity is challenging. Herein, a new way is designed to fabricate an ultrasensitive vertical&#8208;structured photodetector with epitaxial 7&#160;nm BaTiO3 interlayer and 10&#160;nm Ga2O3 photosensitive layer, realizing the detection to a rare weak deep UV light intensity (0.1&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at a voltage under 4.8&#160;V and demonstrating a surge in responsivity up to 1.1&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 with ultrafast response of 0.24 &#181;s/33.4 &#181;s (rise/decay). A responsivity of 3.8&#160;mA&#160;W&#8722;1 at 0&#160;V also has been reached. The dark current is suppressed by enlarged conduction band offset and meanwhile the photocurrent is enhanced by unidirectional conducting valance band offset, which formed by BaTiO3 interlayer. BaTiO3 also contributes most to the photoresponse at 0&#160;V through its ferroelectric depolarization electric field. These results provide a path toward high&#8208;sensitive, low&#8208;power&#8208;consumption, and highly&#8208;integrated deep&#8208;ultraviolet detection, beyond conventional ones.

         <title>Icing on the Cake: Integrating Optical Fiber with Second Near&#8208;Infrared Aggregation&#8208;Induced Emission Luminogen for Exceptional Phototheranostics of Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By elaborate electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge manipulation, a versatile NIR&#8208;II AIE luminogen is constructed. Experimental and theoretical studies both demonstrate that the AIE luminogen is unambiguously advantageous to implement optical fiber&#8208;mediated treatment of bladder cancer under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging.








Abstract
Bladder cancer is a common urological malignancy characterized by high morbidity, high recurrence rate and high mortality, imposing heavy burdens on patients mentally and financially. The research pioneers a diagnostic and therapeutic approach that integrates a second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) multimodal phototheranostic platform with optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy strategy, to implement a comprehensive diagnosis and &#8220;inside&#8208;out&#8221; treatment of bladder cancer. The proposed molecule, namely BTO&#8208;TTQ, is elaborately designed through electron donor/&#960;&#8208;bridge engineering and demonstrates satisfying NIR&#8208;II emission with aggregation&#8208;induced emission features, high photothermal conversion efficiency, and prominent generation of type I reactive oxygen species. Quantum chemical calculations and molecular dynamics simulations are employed to deeply elucidate the energy dissipation pathways of the excited state and the impact of intramolecular motion on their photophysical properties. Furthermore, under the guidance of NIR&#8208;II fluorescent&#8208;photoacoustic&#8208;photothermal trimodal imaging, hyaluronic acid&#8208;modified BTO&#8208;TTQ nanoparticles exhibit exceptional performance in optical fiber&#8208;mediated interventional phototherapy for air&#8208;pouch bladder cancer models. This study thus brings a new insight into the development of superior versatile phototheranostics for clinical theranostics of bladder cancer.

         <title>Topology&#8208;Sensitive Spin&#8208;Selecting Super&#8208;Exchange Interactions at Half&#8208;Antiperovskites with Orderly&#8208;Oxidized Semimetals for Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing orderly&#8208;oxidization strategy is proposed to construct semi&#8208;metallic catalytic units in the topology&#8208;sensitive half&#8208;antiperovskites, in which the spin renormalization from low&#8208;spin state to high&#8208;spin state of active sites can simultaneously improve spin&#8208;dependent acidic OER reactivity and stability. These findings provide new inspirations for steering the spin&#8208;related acidic OER pathway and further promoting the application of topological materials in energy/environmental science.








Abstract
Developing inexpensive catalysts for acidic water oxidation plays a critical role in energy conversions and storages, but which have to trade off their catalytic activity and electrochemical stability. Different from traditional nano&#8208;engineering, herein we focus onto manipulating the spin&#8208;dependent topological quantum interactions to facilitate acidic water splitting at half&#8208;antiperovskite (Ni2Co1In2S2) with orderly&#8208;oxidized Kagome lattices, in which spatial wave functions of the triangular metal units (M3) are spontaneously converted to the anti&#8208;symmetry feature due to the symmetry breaking from controllable bridged&#8208;oxygen decorations (M3O), leading to a spin&#8208;selecting&#8208;dependent electronic reconfiguration. This topology&#8208;sensitive symmetry breaking makes the super&#8208;exchange interactions among neighboring metal sites switch to the indirect out&#8208;plane configuration (M&#9472;O&#9472;M) from the direct in&#8208;plane form (M&#9472;M), meanwhile the spin&#8208;dependent transformation from antiferromagnetic states to ferromagnetic states causes these metal sites to demonstrate a semi&#8208;metallic property for optimizing their bonding interactions with reactants. As a result, the capacity of carrier migration and intermediate diffusion in the inner Helmholtz region is significantly improved, which makes mass activity increase to 20.5 A g&#8722;1 at an overpotential of &#8776;356&#160;mV, demonstrating an obvious superiority over the other state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts without noble metals. This work provides a new insight for designing topology&#8208;dependent catalysts to better understand spin&#8208;related reaction kinetics.

         <title>Engineered Nanozymes with Asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce Sites for Intratumorally Leveraged Multimode Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biodegradable dual&#8208;atom nanozymes with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged Ce&#8208;Mn diatomic catalytic centers embedded in the oxygen vacancy&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate nanospheres is massively produced by a facile hydrothermal method. After loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid, the innovated nanoplatform is used for achieving O2 self&#8208;sufficient photodynamic therapy, tumor glutathione&#8208;depletion/EGCG&#8208;field&#8208;effect enhanced chemdynamic therapy, as well as mild photothermal therapy.








Abstract
Due to the enhanced flexibility of catalytic sites and synergistic effects between dual&#8208;atom active centers, dual&#8208;atom nanozymes stand out in the tumor catalytic therapy. However, precisely regulating the d&#8208;band centers of diatomic sites to break the linear&#8208;scaling relationship between intermediates remains a challenge. Herein, the hydrothermally mass&#8208;produced oxygen vacancies&#8208;engineered bimetallic silicate bio&#8208;nanoplatform with highly asymmetric O&#8208;bridged cerium&#9472;manganese (Ce&#9472;Mn) diatomic catalytic centers (CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG@HA) is meticulously constructed by loading epigallocatechin&#8208;3&#8208;gallate (EGCG) and modifying with hyaluronic acid (HA) for multimodal synergistic cancer therapy. Theoretical calculations reveal that the introduction of Ce sites serves as secondary catalytic centers and upshifts d&#8208;band center of the Mn sites, thereby optimizing the adsorption/desorption of oxygen intermediates. The asymmetric Mn&#9472;O&#9472;Ce moiety facilitates electron transport within CeMn&#8208;V DAs, significantly enhancing peroxidase&#8208;like activities (Km = 27.7&#160;mM and Vmax = 3.21&#215;10&#9472;7&#160;M s&#9472;1). Upon 650&#160;nm laser irradiation, CeMn&#8208;V DAs/EGCG inhibits heat shock protein expression, enabling mild&#8208;photothermal (&#951; = 36.1%) therapy, which can productively inhibit tumor growth in vivo, with an inhibition rate of up to 96.2%. Due to the ligand&#8208;field effect of EGCG&#8208;Mn/Ce complexes, high&#8208;valent metal ions are effectively reduced, sustaining an intrinsic self&#8208;driven cocatalytic cycle reaction. Overall, the construction of highly asymmetric bridged diatomic nanozymes will further promote the deep integration of nanotechnology and biology.

         <title>Long&#8208;Range Cation Disorder Enhances Comprehensive Performance in Mn&#8208;Rich Layered Sodium Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a tailored annealing strategy to disrupt long&#8208;range cation ordering in Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs), enhancing their electrochemical performance for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). Through multiscale structural analyses, including neutron techniques and maximum entropy simulations, improved Na+ diffusion, reduced distortions, and long&#8208;cycle stability, highlighting MRLO as a sustainable, high&#8208;performance cathode material for energy storage applications, are revealed.








Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich layered oxides (MRLOs) are promising low&#8208;cost cathode materials for sustainable sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). However, the low Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential limits their energy densities, and the Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion that occurs surrounding Mn3+ at low voltages destabilizes the structure. Additionally, complex ordered structures inherently present in MRLOs hinder Na+ migration. In this study, new types of cation ordering structures are discovered in common MRLOs. By regulating oxygen vacancy formation, the transition from short&#8208;range to long&#8208;range cation ordering is disrupted, effectively mitigating cooperative Jahn&#8208;Teller distortion and achieving a 95.3% capacity retention over 1&#160;000 cycles at 8&#160;C. The maximum entropy method (MEM) analysis is performed based on neutron diffraction data, which visualizes significantly optimized Na+ diffusion pathways in long&#8208;range disordered cathode with enhanced Na+ diffusion kinetics. Furthermore, the formation of oxygen vacancy elevates the Mn4+/Mn3+ redox potential, resulting in a competitive energy density of 626&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 within 1.5&#8211;4.5&#160;V in a half&#8208;cell configuration. This work offers a multiscale approach to precise elucidation of the cathode crystal structure and provides a feasible pathway to optimize sodium&#8208;ion cathodes by disrupting long&#8208;range cation ordering, ultimately facilitating substantial improvements in electrochemical performance.

         <title>Thermodynamically Self&#8208;Assembly Hydration&#8208;Cycle Crystals for Multidimensional Off&#8208;Grid Water&#8208;Energy Nexus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable hydrophilic coordination scaffolds (RHCS) for sustainable water&#8208;energy systems are presented. The Ca2+&#8208;SO42&#8722; bilayer, stabilized by dynamic hydrogen bonds, enables: 1) 44% lower evaporation enthalpy via asymmetric hydration, 2) ambient self&#8208;assembly of superhydrophilic substrates, and 3) temperature&#8208;responsive regeneration. RHCS reduces energy use by 1&#8211;2 orders versus conventional systems, which offer a closed&#8208;loop solution to global water&#8208;energy challenges.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven interfacial evaporation (SDIE) technology shows water&#8208;energy solution potential but faces industrialization barriers from substrate scalability limits. Here, a regenerative hydrated coordination scaffold (R&#8208;HCS) is presented that redefines material design by leveraging water molecules as dynamic structural directors throughout the material lifecycle. Unlike conventional hydrogel/aerogel systems requiring energy&#8208;intensive crosslinking (&#8722;&#916;E = 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude) or freeze&#8208;drying processes, R&#8208;HCS forms spontaneously through water&#8208;mediated self&#8208;assembly of calcium sulfate under ambient conditions. Hydration shells drive hierarchical crystallization while fundamentally restructuring hydrogen&#8208;bond networks, achieving a 44% reduction in water evaporation enthalpy. The framework demonstrates unique thermal reconfiguration, exhibiting reversible dissociation&#8208;reassembly behavior (&gt;100 &#176;C threshold) that enables full material regeneration (performance decay &lt; 5%) using solar thermal energy/waste heat without chemical additives. Crucially, RHCS maintains exceptional ligand stability even when utilizing natural seawater. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, an R&#8208;HCS integrated passive evaporation module achieves 77.2% water recovery under 1 sun irradiation, coupled with 30 &#176;C thermal assembly temperature reduction at 1.5 sun intensity. Concurrently, crystallizer units maintain stable 2.31&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 evaporation rates in 3.5 wt% brine. This water&#8208;centric design paradigm establishes a new class of adaptive materials where solvent&#8211;solute interactions become the driving force for circular water&#8208;energy systems, potentially redefining sustainable infrastructure for off&#8208;grid regions.

         <title>Suppression of Tin Oxidation via Sn&#8594;B Bonding Interactions for High&#8208;Resolution Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Neuromorphic Imaging Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Boric acid&#8208;added 2D layered tin&#8208;based perovskite ((4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4) films utilize new Sn&#8594;B donor&#8208;acceptor interactions to suppress Sn2+ oxidation, resulting in reduced nonradiative recombination, low trap density, and high uniformity. This enables a vertical optoelectronic synapse with excellent synaptic performance. Finally, a high&#8208;resolution neuromorphic imaging array for image recognition, memory, and processing surpasses traditional image sensors.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free tin&#8208;based perovskites, specifically (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4, possess significant potential for the development of high&#8208;performance, robust neuromorphic imaging sensors, owing to their superior optoelectronic properties and compatibility with conventional complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor fabrication techniques and silicon&#8208;based readout circuits. However, the excessive oxidation of Sn2+ remains a significant obstacle, leading to suboptimal synaptic performance and low resolution in the neuromorphic imaging sensors due to increased recombination losses and poor film uniformity. This study first demonstrates that the introduction of novel Sn&#8594;B donor&#8211;acceptor bonding interactions effectively suppresses Sn2+ oxidation, enhancing uniformity, reducing nonradiative recombination, and improving synaptic plasticity. A vertical optoelectronic synapse demonstrates diverse synaptic behaviors, attributed to hole trapping and detrapping at the device interface. Additionally, the device enables applications in associative learning, neuromorphic computation, letter encoding, and handwritten digit recognition. Ultimately, integration with silicon circuits results in a high&#8208;resolution (32 &#215; 32) neuromorphic imaging array, one of the highest reported resolutions for perovskite optoelectronic synapse arrays. The improved uniformity of boric acid&#8208;added (4&#8208;Cl&#8208;PEA)2SnI4 perovskite films significantly reduces photo response non&#8208;uniformity, enhances resolution, and improves memory capabilities. This neuromorphic imaging array successfully integrates sensing, storage, and computation, enabling advanced functionalities like letter recognition, memory, and processing, surpassing conventional image sensors.

         <title>Modularized Cathode with Neural Network Topology for High Rate and Fault&#8208;Tolerant Lithium&#8208;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

In this study, a modular electrode system is designed by employing nanozyme&#8208;embedded microreactor units as independent reaction modules and establishing a fully connected cascaded neural network topology to enable efficient inter&#8208;module interconnection and synergistic optimization.








Abstract
Enhancing the redox kinetics of electrodes, achieving synergistic optimization of local energy conversion and overall charge transfer, and overcoming the technical bottleneck of significant performance degradation due to local unit failure in traditional electrode systems are crucial for developing high&#8208;rate lithium&#8208;sulfur batteries. Here, a modular cathode system (CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN) with a fully connected cascade neural network topology (FNN) is designed by constructing microreactor modules (CoB1N3&#8208;MRs) with embedded nanozymes (Co&#8208;B1N3), ordering and efficiently interconnecting them. This system not only enables efficient energy conversion within individual microreactors but also significantly enhances the long&#8208;range charge transport efficiency and energy aggregation capacity of the electrodes. Furthermore, CoB1N3&#8208;MR/FNN achieves fault tolerance to local damage through its distributed energy storage units and redundant charge transport channels. This synergistically enhanced modular electrode system for energy conversion and charge transport exhibits high specific discharge capacity (0.2 C, 1211 mAh g&#8722;1) and excellent rate capability (5 C, 731.26 mAh g&#8722;1; 10 C, 471.05 mAh g&#8722;1), and shows outstanding electrochemical performances in high sulfur loading, low electrolytes, and flexible pouch batteries (0.2 C, 1165 mAh g&#8722;1), fully demonstrating its practical application value.

         <title>Spin&#8208;State Manipulation of Atomic Manganese Center by Phosphide&#8208;Support Interactions for Enhanced Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic configuration of Mn single&#8208;atom sites is regulated from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states by embedding well&#8208;defined molybdenum phosphide nanocrystals nearby (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC). The electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction between MoP and Mn single atoms drives the electronic structure transition in Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states, and this transition expedites both O2 adsorption and OH&#8722; desorption. The MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline oxygen reduction reaction performance.








Abstract
Oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) kinetics are closely related to the electronic structure of active sites. Herein, a single&#8208;atomic Mn catalyst decorated with adjacent MoP nanocrystals (MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC) is reported. The decoration of MoP drives the electronic structure transition of Mn sites from low&#8208;spin to high&#8208;spin states through an electronic phosphide&#8208;support interaction. The rearranged electron occupation in 3dxz&#8208;yz and 3dz2 orbitals of Mn sites leads to electrons occupying the &#963; orbital in Mn&#9472;*O2, thereby favoring O2 adsorption to initiate the ORR mechanism. In situ characterizations confirm that Mn 3dz2 orbital occupation state can activate molecular O&#8322; and optimize the adsorption of the *OOH intermediate. As a result, the MoP@MnSAC&#8208;NC displays an outstanding alkaline ORR half&#8208;wave potential (E1/2 = 0.894 V), excellent peak power densities (173/83 mW cm&#8722;2 for liquid/solid&#8208;state Zn&#8208;air batteries, respectively), and long&#8208;term stability (840 h) superior to commercial Pt/C. This work provides profound insights into spintronics&#8208;level engineering, guiding the design of next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance ORR catalysts.

         <title>Full Wafer Scale Manufacturing of Directly Printed TiO2 Metalenses at Visible Wavelengths with Outstanding Focusing Efficiencies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The highest experimentally determined focusing efficiency is reported here by using the direct imprinting of all&#8208;inorganic TiO2 metalens arrays. Absolute efficiency greater than 80% and relative efficiency greater than 90% are achieved by optimization of all fabrication parameters controllable in the additive manufacturing process. The highest refractive index of 2.3 is demonstrated by a short post&#8208;imprint ALD process.








Abstract
Highly efficient metalens arrays designed for 550&#160;nm are directly printed using UV&#8208;assisted nanoimprint lithography (UV&#8208;NIL) and a TiO2 nanoparticle (NP)&#8208;based ink on 8&#8243; optical wafers with imprint times less than 5&#160;min. Approximately one&#8208;thousand 4&#8208;mm metalenses are fabricated per wafer with uniform optical performance using a reusable PDMS&#8208;based elastomeric stamp. The absolute and relative focusing efficiencies are as high as 81.2% and 90.4%, respectively, matching closely with the simulated maximum efficiencies of 83% and 91% achievable with the given master design, indicating that future improvements are possible, and efficiencies are not limited by materials or process. The imprinted metalenses are free from organics due to a post&#8208;imprint calcination step and exhibit outstanding dimensional and optical stabilities. The highest efficiencies are attained using imprint formulations comprised of mixtures of 10 and 20&#160;nm TiO2 NPs, whose denser packing not only increases the refractive index (RI) of the calcined lenses up to 2.0 but also reduces the feature shrinkage relative to the master. 25 cycles of atomic layer deposition of TiO2 following imprinting increase the RI up to 2.3 without changing dimensions by uniform gap filling between NPs. This work opens a path for true, full&#8208;scale additive manufacturing of metaoptics.

         <title>Nucleation&#8208;Layer Assisted Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Tin Perovskite Solar Cells With High Oxygen Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nucleation&#8208;layer assisted strategy is developed to achieve quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper Sn&#8208;based perovskite film with an intermediate&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated narrow phase distribution, vertical crystal orientation, and superior morphology, which enables device with champion efficiency of 11.18% and a record oxygen stability for Sn&#8208;based perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Tin (Sn)&#8208;based perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are extremely vulnerable to oxygen. Nevertheless, mechanism understanding and fundamental strategies to achieve oxygen&#8208;stable Sn&#8208;based PSCs are lacking. Here a nucleation&#8208;layer assisted (NLA) strategy by forming nucleation layer at the interface of hole transport layer and perovskite to attain highly oxygen&#8208;stable quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8208;Popper (RP) Sn&#8208;based PSCs is reported. The formation process of nucleation layer consists of washing off the prepared perovskite film and annealing the residue on the substrate, which produces a new substrate for perovskite film fabrication. Such nucleation layer can transform the subsequently deposited perovskite film from a small&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated wide phase distribution with random crystal orientation into an intermediate&#8208;n&#8208;value dominated narrow phase distribution with vertical crystal orientation. This nucleation layer also improves the perovskite film morphology with highly coadjacent flake&#8208;like grains, leading to reduced grain boundaries and pinholes. The resultant NLA perovskite film shows more efficient carrier transport capability, lower exciton&#8208;binding energy, weakened electron&#8208;phonon coupling, and significantly decreased oxygen diffusion rate upon oxygen exposure. Consequently, a quasi&#8208;2D RP Sn&#8208;based PSC with a champion efficiency of 11.18% is obtained. The unencapsulated device preserves 95% of its initial efficiency after a 2700&#8208;h oxygen aging test, creating a record oxygen stability for Sn&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Interfacial Charge Transfer in ZnO/COF S&#8208;Scheme Photocatalyst via Zn&#9472;N Bond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reveals the role of interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds in enhancing charge transfer and optimizing energy band alignment in S&#8208;scheme ZnO/covalent organic framework heterojunctions. Theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy confirm the mechanism, providing molecular&#8208;level insights into charge transfer processes and guiding the design of efficient photocatalysts for artificial photosynthetic systems.








Abstract
Photocatalysis is a promising solution to global energy shortage and environmental problems. Inspired by photosynthesis, multicomponent heterostructured photocatalysts are extensively investigated, and step&#8208;scheme (S&#8208;scheme) heterojunction has emerged as the theoretical basis for delineating charge transfer processes in predominant heterostructured photocatalysts. However, the specific charge transfer pathway across an S&#8208;scheme heterojunction remains elusive from an atomic/molecular perspective. Herein, it is demonstrated that in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts composed of imine&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks and nanostructured zinc oxide, interfacial Zn&#9472;N bonds are formed between the two components and play critical roles as a charge transfer gateway in the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction, based on theoretical calculations, X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy, and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Moreover, mechanisms for enhanced charge transfer across the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction are elucidated using femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy. This work provides new insights into molecular&#8208;level understanding of charge transfer mechanisms in S&#8208;scheme heterojunction photocatalysts for promoting energy and environmental applications of artificial photosynthesis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Out&#8208;of&#8208;plane chemically ordered Ti4MoSiB2 MAB materials with high phase content are synthesized. This material shows desirable comprehensive mechanical properties over a wide temperature range and excellent lubricating and wear resistance performance at high temperatures, since the typical crystal structure and tribological chemical reactions. This discovery opens a door to high&#8208;temperature wear&#8208;resistant structural materials.









Abstract
As a newly emerging class of materials, quaternary layered borides are promising structural&#8211;functional integration materials.

&lt;p&gt;As a newly emerging class of materials, quaternary layered borides are promising structural&#8211;functional integration materials. However, there have been very few systematic and in-depth studies in many areas of these materials, including high-temperature lubrication.

         <title>Smart Lanthanide Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks with Multicolor Luminescence Switching Induced by the Dynamic Adaptive Antenna Effect of Molecular Rotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time and precisely regulated the energy transfer pathways of Ln&#8208;MOFs to achieve efficient multicolor luminescence switching behavior, upconversion luminescence, multiple smart anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, purity monitoring of commercial gadolinium salts, smart photoresponsive specific antibiotics and amino acids.








Abstract
In this work, dynamic molecular rotors are used to construct smart lanthanide metal&#8211;organic frameworks (Ln&#8208;MOFs) emitters with adaptive antenna effects for the first time. The movement or distortion of the molecular rotors can be easily regulated by temperature changes, thereby inducing a dynamically changing antenna effect that can automatically match different lanthanide ions, achieving cyclic multicolor luminescence switching behavior and extremely complex multiple encryption anti&#8208;counterfeiting technology. In addition, by regulating the doping ratios of Gd(III) and Tb(III) with Eu(III) within the Ln&#8208;MOFs, differentiated energy transfer pathways are discovered, and red light emission very close to the BT.2020 color gamut standard is obtained. Gd0.99Eu0.01&#8208;MOF containing only 1% Eu(III) can show bright red luminescence, and in the range of 1&#8211;9% Eu(III) content, the characteristic emission intensity of Eu(III) ions and the content show an excellent linear relationship with a slope k as high as 2299. This can be used to identify the content of Eu(III) ions impurities in gadolinium salts from different manufacturers. Eu/Tb&#8208;MOF showed highly sensitive and visualized smart photoresponse behaviors to specific antibiotics and amino acids, respectively, with detection limits of 3.2/2.7&#160;nM (tetracycline), 1.7/15.5&#160;nM (oxytetracycline), 0.13/0.97&#160;nM (aspartic acid), and 0.26/1.16&#160;nM (glutamic acid).

         <title>Electrochromic Smart Windows with On&#8208;Demand Photothermal Regulation for Energy&#8208;Saving Buildings</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
WO3//MnO2&#8208;based electrochromic smart windows with highly selective visible and near&#8208;infrared regulation are achieved by decoupling the mechanisms of reversible deposition and ion adsorption. It is found that the hybrid Cu2+/Mn2+ ions promote proton adsorption while hampering proton insertion on the WO3 surface for the first time, endowing the windows with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art properties.








Abstract
Electrochromic smart windows with dynamic photothermal management can enhance living comfort and reduce building energy consumption. However, they usually suffer from low selectivity and optical modulation in visible (VIS) and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) regions owing to the coupled mechanism restriction. Here, the reversible deposition and ion adsorption in WO3//MnO2&#8208;based smart windows are decoupled using a hybrid electrolyte, realizing their independent and efficient VIS&#8211;NIR regulation. The Cu2+/Mn2+ ions in the hybrid electrolyte enhance proton adsorption on the WO3 surface while impeding proton insertion, imparting state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NIR regulation to the WO3 electrode. Moreover, the synergy of protons and Cu2+/Mn2+ ions facilitates reversible MnO2 electrodeposition on the electrode, triggering independent tuning of VIS light with an optical modulation of 94%. The outdoor test and simulation reveal that the smart window achieves cooling at 5&#8211;10&#160;&#176;C, an energy savings of 73.2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;2 and a reduction of 14.4&#160;kg of CO2 emissions per square meter of the building annually. This work would contribute to energy&#8208;saving and emission&#8208;reduction solutions in widespread applications.

         <title>Molecularly Engineered Rigid Ultra&#8208;Micropore Membranes for Ultrahigh&#8208;Power Osmotic Energy Harvesting from High&#8208;Temperature Hypersaline Brine</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rigid ultra&#8208;micropores are constructed by confining the semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with an amphiphilic molecule. The power density of the membrane can reach up to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 with high temperature (60 &#176;C) hypersaline brine (5M/0.5M), which can be obtained from a solar stiller.








Abstract
Osmotic energy is a promising renewable energy source for its giant reserves and can be easily harvested with ion selective membranes. However, the output power density in membrane&#8208;scale applications is always below 10 W m&#8722;2 due to the high resistance from low salinity solution and the serious concentration polarization phenomenon. Here, this study shows that rigid ultra&#8208;micropores can greatly improve the output power density of the osmotic energy conversion process with high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine. The membrane with rigid ultra&#8208;micropores is constructed by confining the high&#8208;content semi&#8208;rigid sulfonated poly(ether ether ketone) molecules in graphene oxide nanochannels and fixing them with amphiphilic molecules. The output power density of the membrane can be as high as 175.1 W m&#8722;2 with an energy conversion efficiency of 44.5% at the salinity gradient of 5 M/0.5 M, which can further increase to 371.65 W m&#8722;2 when the solution temperature is up to 60 &#176;C. This study also demonstrates that the high&#8208;temperature hypersaline brine can be obtained from a passive solar stiller. The molecular engineering of ion selective membranes and the optimization strategy of the reverse electrodialysis process will inspire the development of a next&#8208;generation osmotic energy harvesting system.

         <title>Rational Regulation of Layer&#8208;by&#8208;Layer Processed Active Layer via Trimer&#8208;Induced Pre&#8208;Swelling Strategy for Efficient and Robust Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology is combined with a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy by incorporating a 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) into the buried D18 donor layer to construct thick&#8208;film OSCs. A best performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability is achieved in TIP devices, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.








Abstract
Thick&#8208;film (&gt;300 nm) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered intensifying attention due to their compatibility with commercial roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing technology for the large&#8208;scale continuous fabrication process. However, due to the uncontrollable donor/acceptor (D/A) arrangement in thick&#8208;film condition, the restricted exciton splitting and severe carrier traps significantly impede the photovoltaic performance and operability. Herein, combined with layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition technology, a twisted 3D star&#8208;shaped trimer (BTT&#8208;Out) is synthesized to develop a trimer&#8208;induced pre&#8208;swelling (TIP) strategy, where the BTT&#8208;Out is incorporated into the buried D18 donor layer to enable the fabrication of thick&#8208;film OSCs. The integrated approach characterizations reveal that the exceptional configuration and spontaneous self&#8208;organization behavior of BTT&#8208;Out trimer could pre&#8208;swell the D18 network to facilitate the acceptor's infiltration and accelerate the formation of D/A interfaces. This enhancement triggers the elevated polarons formation with amplified hole&#8208;transfer kinetics, which is essential for the augmented exciton splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the regulated swelling process can initiate the favorable self&#8208;assembly of L8&#8208;BO acceptors, which would ameliorate carrier transport channels and mitigate carrier traps. As a result, the TIP&#8208;modified thin&#8208;film OSC devices achieve the champion performance of 20.3% (thin&#8208;film) and 18.8% (thick&#8208;film) with upgraded stability, among one of the highest performances reported of thick&#8208;film OSCs.

&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thick-film (&amp;gt;300 nm) organic solar cells (OSCs) have garnered intensifying attention due to their compatibility with commercial roll-to-roll printing technology for the large-scale continuous fabrication process. However, due to the uncontrollable donor/acceptor (D/A) arrangement in thick-film condition, the restricted exciton splitting and severe carrier traps significantly impede the photovoltaic performance and operability. Herein, combined with layer-by-layer deposition technology, a twisted 3D star-shaped trimer (BTT-Out) is synthesized to develop a trimer-induced pre-swelling (TIP) strategy, where the BTT-Out is incorporated into the buried D18 donor layer to enable the fabrication of thick-film OSCs. The integrated approach characterizations reveal that the exceptional configuration and spontaneous self-organization behavior of BTT-Out trimer could pre-swell the D18 network to facilitate the acceptor's infiltration and accelerate the formation of D/A interfaces. This enhancement triggers the elevated polarons formation with amplified hole-transfer kinetics, which is essential for the augmented exciton splitting efficiency. Furthermore, the regulated swelling process can initiate the favorable self-assembly of L8-BO acceptors, which would ameliorate carrier transport channels and mitigate carrier traps. As a result, the TIP-modified thin-film OSC devices achieve the champion performance of 20.3% (thin-film) and 18.8% (thick-film) with upgraded stability, among one of the highest performances reported of thick-film OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Conjugated Side&#8208;Chains Optimize Giant Acceptor Compatibility with Low&#8208;Cost Polymer Donor to Overcome the Cost&#8208;Efficiency&#8208;Stability Trilemma in Polymer Solar Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
High&#8208;efficiency and stable polymer solar cells typically rely on expensive oligomeric small&#8208;molecule acceptors and high&#8208;cost polymer donors. To overcome this limitation, conjugated side chains are strategically employed to modulate and dimerize acceptors, precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties for optimal compatibility with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This approach provides a viable pathway toward sustainable and renewable energy solutions.








Abstract
Polymer solar cells (PSCs) rely on blends of small&#8208;molecule acceptors (SMAs) and polymer donors, but the thermodynamic relaxation of SMAs requires an oligomeric approach to enhance operational stability. However, high&#8208;efficiency devices often depend on the expensive synthesis of oligomeric SMAs and costly polymer donors, posing a significant barrier to achieving sustainable and renewable energy. Here, the challenge is addressed through a thermodynamically derived compatibility of giant acceptors with the low&#8208;cost polymer donor PTQ10. This is achieved by strategically employing conjugated side chains to modulate and dimerize acceptors, thereby precisely tuning their thermodynamic properties to optimize compatibility. Our synthetic&#160;route avoids toxic reagents, halogenated solvents, and harsh conditions. The dimer (DYBT) incorporating an n&#8208;type linker enhances crystallinity, absorption, and intramolecular superexchange coupling compared to its p&#8208;type counterpart, and achieves a device efficiency of 19.53%. Considering efficiency, stability, and material cost, the potential cost per kilowatt for the PTQ10:DYBT device is 0.10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1, while most systems exceed 10 $&#160;kW&#8722;1. These findings offer valuable insights for the cost&#8208;effective oligomeric acceptors, to well pair with low&#8208;cost donors and reduce the overall material cost of the photo&#8208;active layer for sustainable and durable energy.

         <title>Natural van der Waals Canalization Lens for Non&#8208;Destructive Nanoelectronic Circuit Imaging and Inspection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Canalization&#8208;based super&#8208;resolution imaging has been achieved based on ultralow&#8208;loss and extremely anisotropic phonon polaritons in a natural van der Waals material &#945;&#8208;MoO3. This canalization lens exhibits the superior capability to resolve deeply subwavelength feature sizes down to 15&#160;nm, which represents a promising solution for non&#8208;destructive nanoelectronic circuit imaging and inspection.









Abstract
Optical inspection has long served as a cornerstone non&#8208;destructive method in semiconductor wafer manufacturing, particularly for surface and defect analysis. However, conventional techniques such as dark&#8208;field scattering optics or atomic force microscopy (AFM) face significant limitations, including insufficient resolution or the inability to resolve subsurface features. Here, an approach is proposed that integrates the strengths of dark&#8208;field scattering optics and AFM by leveraging a van der Waals (vdW) canalization lens based on natural biaxial &#945;&#8208;MoO3 crystals. This method enables ultrahigh&#8208;resolution subwavelength imaging with the ability to visualize both surface and buried structures, achieving a spatial resolution of 15&#160;nm and grating pitch detection down to 100&#160;nm. The underlying mechanism relies on the unique anisotropic properties of &#945;&#8208;MoO3, where its atomic&#8208;scale unit cells and biaxial symmetry facilitate the diffraction&#8208;free propagation of both evanescent and propagating waves via a flat&#8208;band canalization regime. Unlike metamaterial&#8208;based superlenses and hyperlenses, which suffer from high plasmonic losses, fabrication imperfections, and uniaxial constraints, &#945;&#8208;MoO3 provides robust and super&#8208;resolution imaging in multiple directions. The approach is successfully applied to achieve high&#8208;resolution inspection of buried nanoscale electronic circuits, offering unprecedented capabilities essential for next&#8208;generation semiconductor manufacturing.

         <title>In Situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation of Peptides Into Droplets Targeting Membraneless Organelles for Enhanced Cancer Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ Liquid&#8208;Liquid Phase Separation (LLPS) of peptides in living cells is developed for enhancing cancer chemotherapy through targeting membraneless organelle stress granules. The peptide underwent sulfatase&#8208;induced phase separation into droplets upon sulfate hydrolysis. Decorated with protein ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets coacervated with stress granules, thereby enhancing cancer chemotherapy with sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis.








Abstract
Liquid&#8208;liquid phase separation (LLPS) of proteins and nucleic acids into membraneless organelles (MLOs) plays a critical role in sustaining fundamental physiological processes. However, creating artificial coacervate droplets in living cells from exogenous molecules and modulating the functions of MLOs remain challenging. To address this concern, here we reported enzyme&#8208;induced in situ phase separation of peptides into droplets targeting MLO stress granule (SG) for enhanced cancer chemotherapy. The peptide YSO4F containing two sulfated tyrosine residues undergoes sulfatase&#8208;responsive LLPS into droplets. Cellular studies confirm in situ phase separation of YSO4F selectively in sulfatase&#8208;overexpressing cancer cells. By integrating with appropriate ligands, the in situ&#8208;formed droplets d&#8208;YF&#8208;LSG coacervate with SGs driven by association between the ligand with SG key component protein G3BP2. Mechanistic studies illustrate that the in situ&#8208;formed droplets enhance the cytotoxicity of sorafenib via activating caspase&#8208;dependent apoptosis. Furthermore, animal experiments confirm that administration of the in situ&#8208;formed droplets with sorafenib significantly inhibits tumor growth in murine models bearing tumors, accompanied by an excellent biosafety profile. The findings in this study&#160;elucidate an innovative approach for in situ formulation of coacervate droplets within tumor cells and a new material for targeting membraneless organelles, thus providing a promising new strategy for disease organelle&#8208;targeted therapy in the future.

         <title>Functional Group Engineering Stabilizing Precursor Solution and Passivating Defects for Operationally Stable and Highly Reproducible Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The degradation of perovskite precursors is suppressed by modulating the position and type of functional groups in stabilizers. 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA), with the lowest pKa, effectively improved stability, passivated grain boundary defects, and increased carrier lifetime, leading to a maximum PCE of 26.79% in inverted PSCs fabricated by vacuum flash technology under ambient conditions.








Abstract
The instability of perovskite precursor solution induced by deprotonation of organic cations and oxidation of iodide ions substantially deteriorates the reproducibility and reliability of the photovoltaic performance of perovskite solar cells (PSCs). The above decomposition reactions can be conquered via the synergistic engineering of organic functional groups. However, how spatial conformation and type of weak acid functional groups impact the stability of perovskite precursor solution remains to be investigated. Herein, it is uncovered that the position of functional groups on the benzene and the type of weak acid functional groups remarkably influence the acid dissociation constant (pKa) and thus the stability of perovskite inks. The pKa plays a decisive role in suppressing the deprotonation of organic cations and following the amine&#8208;cation addition&#8208;elimination reaction. The 4&#8208;hydrazinobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;HBSA) with the lowest pKa is optimal in stabilizing perovskite inks and mitigating nonradiative recombination through defect passivation. This breakthrough enables the inverted PSCs to deliver a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.79% (certified 26.36%, the highest PCE value for PSCs prepared in ambient conditions) using vacuum flash evaporation technology. The modulated PSC could maintain 92% of its initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous maximum power point tracking.

         <title>A Facile Strategy for Textile&#8208;Based Highly Sensitive and Water&#8208;Resistant Triboelectric Nanogenerator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new amplified micro&#8208;deformation strategy is proposed to develop a 3D fabric&#8208;based F&#8208;TENG with 3D conductive PPy network and a water&#8208;resistant WPU layer. The device enables highly sensitive and real&#8208;time physiological monitoring, maintains stable performance in both in vivo and skin surface wet conditions, and exhibits excellent antibacterial properties. F&#8208;TENG is expected to achieve the application of integrated diagnosis and treatment.









Abstract
The demand for real&#8208;time physiological monitoring drives innovation in triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs). TENGs offer promise for real&#8208;time dynamic monitoring, but they are often complicated to manufacture, have low sensitivity, and are easily disturbed by ambient humidity. Herein, a fabric&#8208;based integrated triboelectric nanogenerator (F&#8208;TENG) is developed, employing waterborne polyurethane (WPU) as both a water&#8208;resistant encapsulation and friction layer, and polypyrrole (PPy) as a friction and conductive layer. This design simplifies the fabrication process while simultaneously improving the device's resistance to environmental factors. The micro&#8208;filament structure enables localized contact&#8208;separation during deformation, initiating the triboelectric effect, while the 3D architecture amplifies local strain, further enhancing sensitivity to weak signals. F&#8208;TENG demonstrates effective voltage output during carotid and respiratory monitoring, highlighting its capability to detect subtle physiological signals. Furthermore, F&#8208;TENG maintains stable performance under humid conditions, retaining 78.78% of its output voltage as relative humidity increased from 20% to 80%. When implants in the moist environment of a rat's leg, F&#8208;TENG exhibits a notable output of 21&#160;V. In addition, the inherent antibacterial properties of F&#8208;TENG further enhance its application potential. These findings position F&#8208;TENG as a robust and versatile platform for dynamic monitoring, wearable electronics, and integrated diagnostic and therapeutic systems.

         <title>Anisotropy&#8208;Dependent Decay of Room Temperature Metastable Skyrmions and a Nascent Double&#8208;q Spin Texture in Co8Zn9Mn3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Metastable skyrmions in chiral cubic Co8Zn9Mn3 are shown to exhibit decay dynamics influenceable by varying the magnetic anisotropy at room temperature, revealing a new avenue for control of topological magnetism. This study further uncovers a nascent square&#8208;coordinated spin texture that coexists with hexagonal skyrmion lattices, highlighting a rich topological landscape. The findings may enable advanced applications based on dynamic and customizable properties of topological spin textures at room temperature.








Abstract
Chiral cubic Co&#8208;Zn&#8208;Mn magnets exhibit diverse topological spin textures, including room&#8208;temperature skyrmion phases and robust far&#8208;from&#8208;equilibrium metastable states. Despite recent advances in understanding metastable skyrmions, the interplay between compositional disorder and varying magnetic anisotropy on the stability and decay of metastable textures, particularly near room temperature, remains incompletely understood. In this work, the equilibrium and metastable skyrmion formation in Co8Zn9Mn3 is examined, revealing transformations between distinct metastable spin textures induced by temperature and magnetic field. At room temperature, the decay dynamics of metastable skyrmions exhibits a strong dependence on magnetic anisotropy, showcasing a route towards tailoring relaxation behavior. Furthermore, a nascent double&#8208;q spin texture, characterized by two coexisting magnetic modulation vectors q, is identified as a minority phase alongside the conventional triple&#8208;q hexagonal skyrmion lattice. This double&#8208;q texture can be quenched as a metastable state, suggesting both its topological character, and its role as a potential intermediary of metastable skyrmion decay. These findings provide new insights into the tunability of equilibrium and metastable topological spin textures via chemical composition and magnetic anisotropy, offering strategies for designing materials with customizable and dynamic skyrmion properties for advanced technological&#160;applications.

         <title>Optimization of Core&#8211;Shell Ternary Electrodes for High&#8208;Performance Ionic Actuator in Soft Gripper</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A core&#8211;shell ternary electrode (Opt&#8208;SWCNTs/PEDOT:PSS/IL) is developed via a simple two&#8208;step dispersion and vacuum filtration process, with component ratios optimized to achieve excellent mechanical toughness and electrical conductivity based on simulation results. The resulting actuators demonstrate high strain and blocking force, enabling precise gripping and complex deformation, showing great potential for soft robotics and next&#8208;generation electrochemical actuators.








Abstract
Ionic actuators based on composite electrodes consisting of nanomaterials and conducting polymer typically offer the advantages of low&#8208;voltage operation and high stability, however, electrode preparation using conventional mixing suffers from issues of ineffective dispersion of nanomaterials, greatly diminishing their synergistic effects. Here, the ternary electrode system based on SWCNTs/PEDOT: PSS/ionic liquid using the two&#8208;step dispersion process is optimized, achieving a uniformly coated core&#8211;shell structure with high conductivity (&#8776;392.4 S cm&#8722;1). The ions migration process is analyzed according to the core&#8211;shell model, further optimization of the ternary electrode and device structure enables the actuator to realize the peak&#8208;to&#8208;peak strain per volt reaching 1.3% V&#8722;1 and normalized blocking force of 0.15&#160;MPa V&#8722;1 (&#8776;89.2 times its own weight), with stable performance maintained over 1 million cycles. Therefore, the actuator can be utilized for the assembly of multi&#8208;clawed grippers to grasp precision components or larger objects. Multiple connected actuators fulfill a complex deformation, indicating promising applications in smart grippers, bioinspired robotics, and human&#8211;machine interaction.

         <title>Bifunctional Compound Induced Dual Back Surface Fields for Efficient Hole Transport Layer&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;based hole&#8208;transport&#8208;layer&#8208;free perovskite solar cells present a cost&#8208;effective and stable photovoltaic alternative but suffer from low efficiency due to the absence of back surface field (BSF). In this work,&#160;trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate&#160;is utilized to engineer&#160;dual BSFs, significantly enhancing open&#8208;circuit voltage and leading to a&#160;champion efficiency of 20.79%&#8212;marking a substantial improvement in device performance.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;based hole transport layer&#8208;free (C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are promising for low&#8208;cost and stable photovoltaics, but the HTL absence deteriorates their power conversion efficiency (PCE) due to the lack of back surface field (BSF). In this work, the benefits of forming dual BSFs in improving the PCE of C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs are first investigated by simulation. Then, trityl tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate (Tr+TPFB&#8722;) is introduced into the C&#8208;HTL&#8208;free PSCs by post&#8208;treatment for the first time, which enables the formation of dual BSFs. TPFB&#8722; passivates n&#8208;doping defects in perovskite and leads to the formation of perovskite n&#8208;p homojunction, while Tr+ extracts electrons from carbon and lowers its work function, which succeeds realizing dual BSFs. This improves the separation and extraction of photocarriers within the device, which is evidenced by the photoluminescence lifetime imaging of the device cross&#8208;section for the first time. As a result, the average open&#8208;circuit voltage increases significantly by about 70&#160;mV, which largely contributes to the improvement of PCE with a champion value of 20.79% obtained.

         <title>Realizing Uniform Defect Passivation via Self&#8208;Polymerization of Benzenesulfonate Molecules in Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benzenesulfonate monomers undergo&#160;in situ self&#8208;polymerization during the crystallization process of perovskite, providing more uniform passivation for perovskite defects than single molecules. The in situ formed polymer also facilitates the growth of large grain domains and the charge transport, offering an efficiency of 25.34% for small&#8208;area perovskite solar cells and 21.54% for mini&#8208;modules with an active area of 14.0 cm2.








Abstract
Realizing high&#8208;quality perovskite films through uniform defect passivation and crystallization control is pivotal to unlocking the potential of scalable applications. However, prevalent small&#8208;molecule additives are inherently susceptible to the crystallization dynamics of perovskites, resulting in non&#8208;uniform distribution within the crystalline film and impeding consistent passivation and precise crystallization control. While polymers offer improved uniformity, their poor solubility restricts practical applications.

     alt="Realizing Uniform Defect Passivation via Self-Polymerization of Benzenesulfonate Molecules in Perovskite Photovoltaics"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Benzenesulfonate monomers undergo&#160;in situ self-polymerization during the crystallization process of perovskite, providing more uniform passivation for perovskite defects than single molecules. The in situ formed polymer also facilitates the growth of large grain domains and the charge transport, offering an efficiency of 25.34% for small-area perovskite solar cells and 21.54% for mini-modules with an active area of 14.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Realizing high-quality perovskite films through uniform defect passivation and crystallization control is pivotal to unlocking the potential of scalable applications. However, prevalent small-molecule additives are inherently susceptible to the crystallization dynamics of perovskites, resulting in non-uniform distribution within the crystalline film and impeding consistent passivation and precise crystallization control. While polymers offer improved uniformity, their poor solubility restricts practical applications. To overcome this limitation, an in situ self-polymerization strategy is employed, enabling homogeneous coordination between sulfonate-containing additives and undercoordinated lead cations. This approach enhances perovskite film quality, promotes larger crystalline grain domains, and facilitates more efficient charge transport across grain domain boundaries. As a result, perovskite solar cells (PSCs) achieve a remarkable power conversion efficiency of 25.34% in small-area devices and 21.54% in 14.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; mini-modules, accompanied by exceptional operational stability. These findings highlight in situ polymerization as an effective strategy for leveraging sulfonate additives to overcome distribution challenges, advancing the scalable fabrication of efficient and stable PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fast&#8208;Charging Phosphorus Anodes Enabled by Fluorinated Weakly Solvated Electrolytes for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Lithium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal weakly&#8208;solvated electrolyte design principle is established for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes through systematic evaluation. Based on this criterion, the fluorinated solvent of FEC emerges as the optimal co&#8208;solvent, effectively suppressing the dissolution of lithium polyphosphides while enhancing desolvation/charge&#8208;transfer kinetics and simultaneously fostering a stable inorganic&#8208;rich SEI layer. This rational strategy addresses critical interfacial challenges in high&#8208;performance phosphorus&#8208;based battery systems.








Abstract
hosphorus&#8208;based anodes hold promise for energy storage due to their high theoretical capacity and favorable lithiation potential. However, their practical application is hindered by sluggish reaction kinetics and irreversible capacity loss, primarily attributed to multiphase lithiation/delithiation reactions and the dissolution of lithium polyphosphide intermediates. Herein, a universal design principle of weakly solvated electrolytes (WSEs) tailored for phosphorus&#8208;based anodes is proposed. Combined with a high dielectric constant, and significant dipole moment, a fluorinated cosolvent is incorporated into a WSE to effectively suppress the dissolutions of lithium polyphosphides, enhance interfacial stability, and accelerate reaction kinetics. With this electrolyte, a phosphorus&#8208;based anode achieves a remarkable capacity of 2615.2 mAh g&#8315;&#185; at 1C, maintaining 91.7% capacity retention over 1000 cycles. Even at a high rate of 4 C, it delivers 2210.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185; with an exceptional retention of 96.7% after 1500 cycles. Furthermore, at 0 &#176;C, the anode sustains a capacity of 2016.7 mAh g&#8315;&#185;, with 97% retention after 300 cycles at 1C. This study provides a novel electrolyte design strategy to regulate the solvation sheath, paving the way for high&#8208;rate, long&#8208;cycle phosphorus&#8208;based anodes suitable for fast&#8208;charging applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer Interface with Reconstructed Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Network for Enhanced CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that facilitates CO2 mass transport and maintained an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. The optimized catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5 mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency and operated very stably.








Abstract
CO2 electrolysis is a promising approach to reduce CO2 emissions while achieving high&#8208;value multi&#8208;carbon (C2+) products. Except for the key role of electrocatalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR), Reaction microenvironment is another critical factor influencing catalytic performance for these catalysts. Herein, a self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) is proposed with reconstructed hydrogen&#8208;bond network to form an efficient three&#8208;phase interface that admins mass transport and ion&#8208;electron transfer. This approach is realized by co&#8208;assembly of the fluorinated SAM (F&#8208;SAM) and siloxane on commercial Cu catalyst (Cu@F&#8208;Si composite catalyst). Molecular dynamics simulations (MDS) and interfacial species analysis show that the F&#8208;SAM effectively facilitates CO2 mass transport,&#160;while the siloxane hydrogen bond network maintains an ideal H+/e&#8722; transfer pathway. Combined with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, this strategy reveals the mechanism by which optimizing *H/*CO coverage enhances C2+ product selectivity. Ultimately, the Cu@F&#8208;Si catalyst maintains a high current density of 502.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with over 85% C2+ Faradaic efficiency (FE) and operates stably for more than 100&#160;h at &#8776;300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This interface engineering strategy offers a promising solution for improving the efficiency of CO2RR, with broader applications in multiphase catalytic systems.

         <title>A Perspective on the Origin of High&#8208;Entropy Solid Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective critically examines HE approaches in SEs, highlighting how compositional complexity induces system disorder and local&#8208;structure evolution to enhance stability and properties. While HE concepts are attractive, establishing rigorous structure&#8208;property relationships requires further investigation. The discussion aims to guide future research in this promising field by clarifying key challenges and opportunities in HE&#8208;based electrolyte design.








Abstract
As the key material for the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs), solid electrolytes (SEs) have attracted increasing attention. Recently, a novel design strategy&#8722;high&#8208;entropy (HE) approach is frequently reported to improve the ionic conductivity and electrochemical performance of SEs. However, the fundamental understandings on the HE working mechanism and applicability evaluation of HE concept are deficient, which would impede the sustainable development of a desirable strategy to enable high&#8208;performance SEs. In this contribution, the essence of HE&#8208;related approaches and their positive effects on SEs are evaluated. The reported HE strategy stems from complex compositional regulations. The derived structural stability and enhanced property are originally from the modulated system disorder and subtle local&#8208;structure evolutions, respectively. While HE ardently describes the increased entropy/disorder during the modification of prevailing SEs, rigorous experimental formulations, and direct correlations between the HE structures and desired properties are necessary to be established. This perspective would be a timely and critical overview for the HE approaches in the context of SEs, aiming to stimulate further discussion and exploration in this emerging research direction.

         <title>Interlayer Design for Halide Electrolytes in All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide solid electrolytes, an emerging family of materials, encounter anodic stability challenges that limit their application. By synthesizing Li3YbCl6 and Li3LuCl6 and incorporating a Li6PI3 interlayer, this study achieves lithium&#8208;stable halide electrolytes with reduced interface resistance and enhanced critical current density. These advancements pave the way for safer, high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries for electric transportation.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state lithium&#8208;metal batteries (ASSLMBs) are promising for transportation electrification due to their superior safety and high energy density. Lithium halide electrolytes provide excellent processing flexibility, high ionic conductivity, and anodic stability (&gt;4.1&#160;V), making them highly compatible with high&#8208;voltage cathodes, surpassing sulfide electrolytes (&lt;2.1&#160;V). Nevertheless, halide electrolytes suffer from low cathodic stability and form an electronically conductive interphase with lithium, resulting in a critical current density (CCD) of nearly zero. Herein, Li3YbCl6 electrolytes are synthesized that are kinetically stable with lithium by forming an electronic insulating solid electrolyte interphase. Guided by critical overpotential criteria, a PI3 interlayer is designed that transforms into Li6PI3 upon contact with lithium, substantially reducing the interfacial resistance of Li3YbCl6 against lithium to 34 &#937; and achieving a high critical overpotential of 114&#160;mV. By substituting Yb with Lu, Li3LuCl6 electrolytes with Li6PI3 interlayers reach a CCD of 1.0&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&#8722;2, comparable to sulfide electrolytes but with higher oxidation stability. Additionally, Li6PI3 enables stable cycling of Li//Li cells with Li3LuCl6 electrolytes at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 400 cycles and maintains 86.5% capacity in Li//LiCoO2 cells after 220 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for high&#8208;performance ASSLMBs.

By substituting Yb with Lu, Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes with Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; interlayers reach a CCD of 1.0&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a capacity of 1.0 mAh cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;, comparable to sulfide electrolytes but with higher oxidation stability. Additionally, Li&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;PI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; enables stable cycling of Li//Li cells with Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;LuCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; electrolytes at 0.5&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for 400 cycles and maintains 86.5% capacity in Li//LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells after 220 cycles at 30&#160;&#176;C, paving the way for high-performance ASSLMBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Shape&#8208;Evolving Structured Liquids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A synthetic system mimics essential functions of living cells&#8212;migration, division, and reconfiguration&#8212;by encapsulation of active magnetic particles within a nanoparticle&#8212;surfactant membrane. This membrane preserves its shape after deformations, which can be tuned with surfactant concentrations. The resulting biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive material paves the way for autonomous synthetic machines.








Abstract
Migration, division, and reconfiguration &#8211; functions essential to living systems &#8211; are driven by active processes. Developing synthetic mimics is an outstanding challenge. Lipid bilayers that bound natural systems are locally deformed by active species, e.g., microtubules, but the resulting non&#8208;equilibrium shapes relax when active species motion ceases, and the shape changes lack immediate control. A fully synthetic system is described, driven by active particles encapsulated by a reconfigurable nanoparticle&#8208;surfactant membrane that undergoes shape fluctuations reminiscent of living cells. These shape changes are preserved after particle activity stops. Surfactant concentration tunes the interfacial tension over three orders of magnitude, making on&#8208;demand shape evolution possible. Directional migration, division, and reconfiguration across multiple scales are possible, leading to a new class of biomimetic, reconfigurable, and responsive materials, paving the way for autonomous synthetic machines.

         <title>Electrochemical Anodization for the Fabrication of Wafer&#8208;Scale p&#8208;Type Organic Permeable Base Transistors Arrays with MHz Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a wafer&#8208;scale fabrication method for high&#8208;performance p&#8208;type organic permeable base transistors (OPBTs) using electrochemical anodization. The anodized OPBTs achieve high on&#8208;current density, low leakage, MHz&#8208;range operation, and exceptional current gain. With a 96.3% yield in large&#8208;area arrays, these devices enable scalable organic electronics and advanced complementary circuits, demonstrating potential for future display and logic applications.








Abstract
Organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) are promising for flexible, low&#8208;cost, and biocompatible electronics. However, conventional planar OTFTs are hindered by the large channel length limiting the transconductance and switching frequencies. Vertical OTFTs, particularly organic permeable&#8208;base transistors (OPBTs), address these challenges with short channel lengths defined by the layer thickness. While n&#8208;type OPBTs have advanced significantly, p&#8208;type OPBTs face challenges such as lower transmission, higher leakage currents, and unreliable fabrication processes. This work introduces a wafer&#8208;scale method for fabricating p&#8208;type OPBTs using electrochemical anodization of the base electrode. The anodization process applied directly atop the organic semiconductor, preserves electrical properties while suppressing base leakage. The resulting anodized OPBTs exhibit high&#8208;performance characteristics, including an on&#8208;current density of 301 mAcm&#8722;2, low leakage current of 4.32 &#215; 10&#8722;9 A, maximum transmission of 99.9999%, and a maximum current gain of 1.89 &#215; 106&#8212;a 100,000&#8208;fold improvement over prior methods. Small signal analysis reveals a cutoff frequency of 1.49 MHz, with a voltage&#8208;normalized cutoff frequency of 0.54 MHzV&#8722;1. Large&#8208;scale arrays show 96.3% fabrication yield and excellent uniformity. Complementary inverters integrating n&#8208; and p&#8208;type OPBTs exhibit superior switching, highlighting the potential of anodized OPBTs for advanced applications in displays and&#160;circuits.

         <title>Entropy&#8208;Driven Stabilization of Noble Metal Single Atoms: Advancing Ammonia Synthesis and Energy Output in Zinc&#8208;Nitrate Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposed an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy, demonstrating that the (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate can accommodate more Ru single atoms than the traditional low&#8208;entropy single oxides such as CeO2, and achieve excellent performance in ammonia electrosynthesis and energy output of zinc&#8208;nitrate batteries.








Abstract
Noble metal single atoms (NMSA) offer exceptional atom utilization and catalytic activity but face challenges like limited stability, low atomic loading, and complex synthesis. This study presents an innovative entropy&#8208;driven strategy to stabilize Ru single atoms (SA) on a (CePrYZrHf)Ox high&#8208;entropy oxide substrate (Ru&#945;%&#8208;HEO). Due to their defect&#8208;rich structure and significant lattice distortion, HEO substrates can accommodate and stabilize more Ru SA than traditional low&#8208;entropy oxides (LEO) like CeO2. This strategy is also effective for achieving high loadings&#160;of other NMSAs, such as Pd and Pt. Ru3%&#8208;HEO, as an electrocatalyst for nitrate reduction, achieves a high ammonia yield (5.79 mg h&#8722;1 mgcat.&#8722;1) and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 91.3%. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that Ru3%&#8208;HEO exhibits favorable thermodynamics for nitrate reduction, with a lower energy barrier for the rate&#8208;determining step of first hydrogenation (*NO + H+ + e&#8315; &#8594; *NOH) and stronger intermediates adsorption compared to RuO2, enhancing its catalytic efficiency. As a cathode material in a zinc&#8208;nitrate battery, Ru3%&#8208;HEO demonstrates a high NH3 yield rate (1.11 mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2) and FE value (93.4%). This study provides an efficient strategy to produce stable and high&#8208;loading SA using high&#8208;entropy materials, showcasing their broad applicability in advanced electrocatalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable, heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot color conversion layers are produced via a versatile crosslinking strategy. The color conversion layers exhibit minimal backlight leakage under mechanical strain, support high&#8208;resolution patterning, and integrate seamlessly with micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diodes. Their incorporation in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare sensors highlights their potential for next&#8208;generation stretchable displays.








Abstract
Stretchable displays are essential components as signal outputs in next&#8208;generation stretchable electronics, particularly for robotic skin and wearable device technologies. Intrinsically&#8208;stretchable and patternable color conversion layers (CCLs) offer practical solutions for developing full&#8208;color stretchable micro&#8208;light&#8208;emitting diode (LED) displays. However, significant challenges remain in creating stretchable and patternable CCLs without backlight leakage under mechanical deformation. Here, a novel material strategy for stretchable and patternable heavy&#8208;metal&#8208;free quantum dot (QD) CCLs, potentially useful for robotic skin and wearable electronics is presented. Through a versatile crosslinking technique, uniform and high&#8208;concentration QD loading in the elastomeric polydimethylsiloxane matrix without loss of optical properties is achieved. These CCLs demonstrate excellent color conversion capabilities with minimal backlight leakage, even under 50% tensile strain. Additionally, fine&#8208;pixel patterning process with resolutions up to 300 pixels per inch is compatible with the QD CCLs, suitable for high&#8208;resolution stretchable display applications. The integration of these CCLs with micro&#8208;LED displays is also demonstrated, showcasing their use in haptic&#8208;responsive robotic skin and wearable healthcare monitoring sensors. This study offers a promising material preparation methodology for stretchable QDs/polymer composites and highlights their potential for advancing flexible and wearable light&#8208;emitting devices.

         <title>Wearable Photonic Device for Multiple Biomarker Sampling and Detection without Blood Draws</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A wearable photonic device (PiED) is developed by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and multiple blood biomarker detection without blood draw. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595 nm into skin, evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis and inducing biomarker extravasation.








Abstract
Needle&#8208;based blood draws or phlebotomy practice in clinics for centuries, often causing pain, discomfort, and inconvenience. Here, a wearable photonic device is presented by integrating a microlens array (MLA) and an optic microneedle array (OMNA) functionalized with immunobinding for safe and needle&#8208;free biomarker sampling and detection. The MLA&#8208;integrated OMNA amplifies and transmits LED light at 595&#160;nm into skin through the OMNA, bypassing the light&#8208;absorbing melanin in the epidermal layer, and evenly distributing it in the capillary&#8208;enriched dermis independent of the skin colors. The 595&#160;nm light is absorbed by hemoglobin (Hb) and oxygen&#8208;Hb within the capillaries, triggering thermal dilation of capillaries without damaging them or causing petechiae. The light illumination remarkably increases in the concentrations of various blood biomarkers in the skin through biomarker extravasation. These biomarkers bound specifically to the capture antibodies on&#160;OMNA with each microneedle covalently immobilized with one specific antibody. The OMNA is extensively modified to amplify the immunobinding signals and achieve sensitivity superior to that of enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits. As proof of concept, the functionality of the prototype for minimally invasive sampling and precise multiplexed blood biomarker detection in two mouse models is validated to quantify acute inflammation and specific antibody production.

         <title>Reconstruction of the Buried Interface of Triple&#8208;Halide Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for All&#8208;Perovskite Tandems</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By modifying the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite (WBG) with potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK), a graded heterojunction is formed between the buried thin layer and the bulk, thereby improving the quality of the WBG perovskite film. Ultimately, an all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.30% is achieved.








Abstract
All&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells (TSCs) paired by wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskites with narrow&#8208;bandgap perovskites holds the potential to overcome the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limitation. However, the severe phase segregation and non&#8208;radiative recombination of WBG perovskite put on a shadow for their power conversion efficiency and stability. Here, an interfacial engineering strategy is introduced into the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. Potassium trifluoromethanesulfonate (TfOK) is utilized to reconstruct the buried interface of the triple&#8208;halide WBG perovskite. The distribution of (chlorine) Cl&#8722; changes from perovskite bulk toward the buried interface due to the TfOK addition. Therefore, a wider bandgap perovskite thin layer is formed at buried layer, which can form a graded heterojunction with bulk WBG perovskite to improve carrier separation and transfer. Meanwhile, the (potassium) K+ of TfOK diffuses into WBG perovskite bulk to suppress halide phase segregation. Consequently, the 1.78&#160;eV WBG PSCs deliver an impressive power conversion efficiency of 20.47% and an extremely high fill factor over 85%. Furthermore, the resultant two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite TSCs achieves a champion efficiency of 28.30%. This strategy provides a unique avenue to improve performance and photostability of WBG PSCs, a new function of Cl&#8722; in triple&#8208;halide is illustrated.

         <title>Engineering Flow&#8208;Through Hollow Fiber Gas&#8208;Diffusion Electrodes for Unlocking High&#8208;Rate Gas&#8208;Phase Electrochemical Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Advancing gas&#8208;phase electrolysis toward industrial&#8208;scale applications requires not only the development of advanced electrocatalysts but also the design of the electrodes to optimize gas&#8208;electrode&#8208;electrolyte interfaces and facilitate efficient mass transport, thereby reinforcing gas win the electrons to promote reaction kinetics and suppress side reactions. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for emerging flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes.








Abstract
Designing advanced electrodes with efficient contact with gas, electrolytes, and catalysts presents significant opportunities to enhance the accessibility of concentrated gas molecules to the catalytic sites while mitigating undesirable side reactions such as the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), which advances the gas&#8208;phase electrochemical reduction toward industrial&#8208;scale applications. Traditional planar electrodes face challenges, including limited gas solubility and restricted mass transport. Although commercial flow&#8208;by gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes can reduce mass transfer resistance by enabling direct diffusion of gas molecules to active sites, the reliance on diffusive gas flow becomes insufficient to meet the rapid consumption demands of gas reactants at high current density. Flow&#8208;through hollow fiber gas&#8208;diffusion electrodes (HFGDEs) or hollow fiber gas penetration electrodes (HFGPEs) provide a promising solution by continuously delivering convective gas flow to active sites, resulting in enhanced mass transport and superior gas accessibility near the catalytic sites. Notably, HFGDEs have demonstrated the ability to achieve current densities exceeding multiple amperes per square centimeter in liquid electrolytes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the design criteria, fabrication methods, and design strategies for porous metallic HFGDEs. It highlights the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advancements in HFGDEs composed of various metals (e.g., Cu, Ni, Ag, Bi, Ti, and Zn), with a particular focus on their utilization in the electrochemical conversion of CO2. Finally, future research directions are discussed, underscoring the potential of porous metallic HFGDEs as a versatile and scalable electrode architecture for diverse electrochemical applications.

         <title>Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active Single&#8208;Atom Modified S&#8208;MXene as Cathode Catalysts for Li&#8208;S Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li&#8322;S oxidation process on single&#8208;atom&#8208;modified S&#8208;functionalized MXenes (SA&#8208;S&#8208;MXenes) monolayers are investigated. Five SA adsorption sites are considered: fcc (I), hcp (II), top (III), M substitution by SA (IV), and S substitution by SA (V). Among these, Ni, Cu, and Zn at the IV site exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance, characterized by the lowest Gibbs free energy for the SRR process and the decomposition barrier for Li&#8322;S.








Abstract
The practical application of Li&#8208;S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. To address these challenges, this work proposes an efficient strategy by introducing single atoms (SAs) into sulfur&#8208;functionalized MXenes (S&#8208;MXenes) catalysts and evaluate their potential in Li&#8208;S batteries through first&#8208;principles calculations. Using high&#8208;throughput screening of various SA&#8208;modified S&#8208;MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S&#8208;MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene&#8208;based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA&#8208;induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d&#8208;band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates.

     alt="Rational Design of Highly Stable and Active Single-Atom Modified S-MXene as Cathode Catalysts for Li-S Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The sulfur reduction reaction (SRR) and Li&#8322;S oxidation process on single-atom-modified S-functionalized MXenes (SA-S-MXenes) monolayers are investigated. Five SA adsorption sites are considered: fcc (I), hcp (II), top (III), M substitution by SA (IV), and S substitution by SA (V). Among these, Ni, Cu, and Zn at the IV site exhibit the best electrocatalytic performance, characterized by the lowest Gibbs free energy for the SRR process and the decomposition barrier for Li&#8322;S.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The practical application of Li-S batteries is hindered by the shuttle effect and sluggish sulfur conversion kinetics. To address these challenges, this work proposes an efficient strategy by introducing single atoms (SAs) into sulfur-functionalized MXenes (S-MXenes) catalysts and evaluate their potential in Li-S batteries through first-principles calculations. Using high-throughput screening of various SA-modified S-MXenes, this work identifies 73 promising candidates that exhibit exceptional thermodynamic and kinetic stability, along with the effective immobilization of polysulfides. Notably, the incorporation of Ni, Cu, or Zn as SAs into S-MXenes results in a significant Gibbs free energy barrier reduction by 51%&#8211;75%, outperforming graphene-based catalysts. This reduction arises from SA-induced surface electron density that influences the adsorption energies of intermediates and thereby disrupts the scaling relations between Li&#8322;S&#8322; and other key intermediates. Further enhancement in catalytic performance is achieved through strain engineering by shifting the d-band center of metal atoms to higher energy levels, increasing the chemical affinity for intermediates. To elucidate the intrinsic adsorption properties of intermediates, this work develops a machine learning model with high accuracy (R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.88), which underscores the pivotal roles of SA electronegativity and local coordination environment in determining adsorption strength, offering valuable insights for the rational design of catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Atomically Dispersed Sn on Core&#8208;Shell MoS2 Nanoreactors as Mott&#8208;Schottky Phase Junctions for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hollow core&#8208;shell structured Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor with a definite Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif is designed, which exhibits a record overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction promotes charge transfer, while the surface Sn single atom facilitates the reduction of adsorbed H&#8314;, thus accelerating the catalytic performance.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) plays a pivotal role in electrochemical energy conversion and storage. However, traditional HER catalysts still face significant challenges, including limited activity, poor acid resistance, and high costs. To address these issues, a hollow core&#8208;shell structured 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 nanoreactor is designed for acidic HER, where Sn single atoms are anchored on the shell of 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2 Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction. The 2H@1T&#8208;MoS2&#8208;Sn1 catalyst demonstrates exceptional HER performance, achieving an ultralow overpotential of 9&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a Tafel slope of 16.3&#160;mV dec&#8722;1 in acidic media&#8212;the best performance reported to date among MoS2&#8208;based electrocatalysts. The enhanced performance is attributed to the internal electric field at the Mott&#8208;Schottky phase junction, which facilitates efficient electron transfer. Additionally, the Sn single atoms modulate the electronic structure of Mo atoms within the Sn&#8208;S2&#8208;Mo motif, inducing a significant shift in the d&#8208;band center and thereby optimizing the dehydrogenation process. This work presents a novel electrocatalyst design strategy that simultaneously engineers interfacial charge transfer and surface catalysis, offering a promising approach for advancing energy conversion technologies.

         <title>Atomic Insights Into Self&#8208;Assembly of Zingibroside R1 and its Therapeutic Action Against Fungal Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryo&#8208;EM reveals Zingibroside R1 (ZR1) undergoes self&#8208;assemble helical nanofibrils. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 nanofibrils and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus to restore the vaginal microenvironment, synergistically inhibiting VVC.








Abstract
Natural products are a crucial resource for drug discovery, but poor understanding of the molecular&#8208;scale mechanisms of their self&#8208;assembly into soluble, bioavailable hydrogels limits their applications and therapeutic potential. It is demonstrated that Zingibroside R1 (ZR1), derived from Panax notoginseng, undergoes spontaneous self&#8208;assemble into a hydrogel comprising helical nanofibrils with potent antifungal activity lacking in its monomeric state. Cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo&#8208;EM) revealed an intricate hydrogen&#8208;bonding network that facilitates ZR1 nanofibril formation, characterized by a hydrophobic core and hydrophilic exterior architecture, which underpin its binding activity with cell wall in the vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC) pathogen, C. albicans. The hydrogen&#8208;bonding interface between ZR1 gel and glucan compromises membrane integrity, inhibiting C. albicans proliferation in vitro and in VVC model mice in vivo. ZR1 gel could also deliver probiotic Lactobacillus, synergistically inhibiting VVC and restoring the vaginal microenvironment. This study advances the mechanistic understanding of ZR1's structure&#8208;function relationships, offering valuable insights into the rational design and therapeutic optimization of natural product&#8208;based hydrogels.

In article number 2502894, Shaoming Huang, Wei Zhang, and co&#8208;workers reveal a novel self&#8208;catalytic conversion reaction mechanism of N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#8208;Co bonds, and heterojunction. Acting as the anode in potassium&#8208;ion batteries, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC composite accelerates the catalytic conversion kinetics of potassium polytellurides (K5Te3 and K2Te) and achieves an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25000 cycles.

Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning
A metallic surface micropatterned with a laser achieves self&#8208;cooling capacity when it faces the night sky thanks to its enhanced infrared emissivity, which triggers water condensation similar to natural dew on leaves. The patterned microgrooves promote condensation as a continuous film rather than dispersed droplets, enabling an efficient and autonomous harvesting of dew water. More details ban be found in article number 2419472 by Pablo Pou&#8208;&#193;lvarez and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Recent Progress in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Toward Hydrogen Peroxide Electrosynthesis and Cooperative Coupling of Anodic Reactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review focuses on the recent advances and regulation strategies in the 2e&#8315; ORR and is systematically structured into three main sections: 1) the latest progress of 2e&#8722; ORR in different reaction environments, especially in the acidic and neutral media; 2) microenvironmental modulation, and 3) the coupling system with cathodic 2e&#8722; ORR and other anodic reactions. This review aims to shed light on the exploration of efficient catalysts for 2e&#8211; ORR and systems for building a green energy roadmap.








Abstract
Electrosynthesis of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) via two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) is a promising alternative to the anthraquinone oxidation process. To improve the overall energy efficiency and economic viability of this catalytic process, one pathway is to develop advanced catalysts to decrease the overpotential at the cathode, and the other is to couple 2e&#8722; ORR with certain anodic reactions to decrease the full cell voltage while producing valuable chemicals on both electrodes. The catalytic performance of a 2e&#8722; ORR catalyst depends not only on the material itself but also on the environmental factors. Developing promising electrocatalysts with high 2e&#8722; ORR selectivity and activity is a prerequisite for efficient H2O2 electrosynthesis, while coupling appropriate anodic reactions with 2e&#8722; ORR would further enhance the overall reaction efficiency. Considering this, here a comprehensive review is presented on the latest progress of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts of 2e&#8722; ORR in different media, the microenvironmental modulation mechanisms beyond catalyst design, as well as electrocatalytic system coupling 2e&#8722; ORR with various anodic oxidation reactions. This review also presents new insights regarding the existing challenges and opportunities within this rapidly advancing field, along with viewpoints on the future development of H2O2 electrosynthesis and the construction of green energy roadmaps.

         <title>3D Bioprinting Models for Glioblastoma: From Scaffold Design to Therapeutic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The schematic representation highlights the essential components for developing a 3D bioprinted glioblastoma model. It includes key microenvironmental factors, biomaterials, and crosslinking techniques. The integration of bioprinting strategies with GBM&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip models enables the creation of dynamic, physiologically relevant models. A Quality&#8208;by&#8208;Design (QbD) roadmap can ensure consistent 3D bioprinting models focusing on critical bioprinting processes and material properties.









Abstract
Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conventional in vitro models fail to accurately mimic the tumor in vivo characteristics, being appointed as one of the causes of clinical attrition rate. Recent advances in 3D culture techniques, replicating essential physical and biochemical cues such as cell&#8211;cell and cell&#8211;extracellular matrix interactions, have led to the development of more realistic tumor models. Bioprinting has emerged to advance the creation of 3D in vitro models, providing enhanced flexibility, scalability, and reproducibility. This is crucial for the development of more effective drug treatments, and glioblastoma (GBM) is no exception. GBM, the most common and deadly brain cancer, remains a major challenge, with a median survival of only 15 months post-diagnosis. This review highlights the key components needed for 3D bioprinted GBM models.

         <title>Leaf Vein&#8208;Inspired Programmable Superstructure Liquid Metal Photothermal Actuator for Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by plant leaf veins and pulp, this work introduced superstructure (ordered grooves) into liquid metal photothermal actuators for the first time and prepared LM@PI/PDMS programmable photothermal actuators with excellent comprehensive performance utilizing laser etching, including rapid oscillation, rapid response, strong load&#8208;carrying capacity, and excellent stability, which can be utilized to create versatile smart devices and robots.








Abstract
Asymmetric&#8208;expansion photothermal actuators have attracted the attention of researchers owing to their simple structure, superior stability, rapid response, and precise controllability. However, their response speed, deformation capacity, and load&#8208;carrying capacity are mutually constrained by their thickness. Inspired by the veins and pulp in plant leaves, this study uses laser etching to apply a superstructure of ordered grooves to liquid metal (LM) photothermal actuators. The resulting LM@low&#8208;expansion polyimide (4.52&#160;ppm K&#8722;1)/polydimethylsiloxane (LM@PI/PDMS) programmable photothermal actuators demonstrate exceptional performance, including a load&#8208;carrying capacity of 190 times their weight, a rapid oscillation frequency of 19&#160;Hz, a response speed of 60.96 &#177; 3.08&#176;/ s, and a bending angle of 159.05 &#177; 2.52&#176;. Hence, the proposed design resolves the inherent conflict between the load&#8208;carrying capacity and response speed. Furthermore, incorporating LM microspheres into actuators increases their stability and allows them to endure more than 20&#160;800 cycles without damage. The actuators are used to create versatile smart devices and robots, such as photothermally actuated robotic dogs that can function across various terrains. This study provides a novel strategy for the design and fabrication of programmable photothermal actuators and highlights their potential for applications in advanced robotics, which paves the way for their integration into complex environments.

         <title>Achieving a Record Photoluminescence Quantum Yield in Green Light&#8208;Emitting Carbon&#8208;Centered Radicals with Nanosecond Emission Lifetimes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbene, which exhibit hybrid local and charge transfer states, can inhibit the nonradiative channels and open the radiative channels, thereby achieving a record photoluminescence quantum yield with a nanosecond lifetime in green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals. This work may open new avenues for designing high&#8208;efficiency doublet emitters in the green range.








Abstract
Organic luminescent radicals possess considerable potential for applications in organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs)&#8208;based visible light communication owing to their intrinsic advantages of nanosecond emission lifetimes and spin&#8208;allowed radiative transitions. However, the inherently narrow energy bandgap and multiple nonradiative channels of organic radicals make it difficult to achieve efficient green and blue light&#8208;emitting, which is not conducive to applying visible light communication in diverse fields. In this study, a series of carbon&#8208;centered radicals derived from N&#8208;heterocyclic carbenes are designed and synthesized, some of which exhibiting hybrid local and charge&#8208;transfer (HLCT) states that resulting in efficient green emission. The results of photophysical characterizations and theoretical calculations demonstrate that the luminescence efficiency is closely related to their emission states. This relationship inhibits the nonradiative channels while simultaneously opening the radiative channels of organic radicals exhibiting HLCT states but not those with locally excited states. Intriguingly, a high photoluminescence quantum yield value of up to 70.1% at 534 nm is observed, which is the highest among green light&#8208;emitting carbon&#8208;centered radicals reported to date. Based on this exceptional result, an OLED device is fabricated and achieved an external quantum efficiency of 8.8%. These results demonstrate its potential application in electroluminescent devices.

         <title>Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetization Switching Through Topological Surface State in Type&#8208;II Dirac Semimetal Pt3Sn</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A full&#8208;scale field&#8208;free perpendicular magnetization switching driven by spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) is achieved by employing an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal, Pt3Sn. The generation of unconventional SOT is attributed to the spin texture of the topological surface state on the Pt3Sn (111) surface with a z&#8208;polarized spin component. This study positions the Dirac semimetals, such as Pt3Sn, as promising spin sources for integration into advanced spintronic devices.








Abstract
Spin&#8208;orbit torque (SOT) induced by current is a promising approach for electrical manipulation of magnetization in advancing next&#8208;generation memory and logic technologies. Conventional SOT&#8208;driven perpendicular magnetization switching typically requires an external magnetic field for symmetry breaking, limiting practical applications. Recent research has focused on achieving field&#8208;free switching through out&#8208;of&#8208;plane SOT, with the key challenge being the exploration of new spin source materials that can generate z&#8208;polarized spins with high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency, structural simplicity, and scalability for large&#8208;scale production. This study demonstrates field&#8208;free perpendicular switching using an ultrathin type&#8208;II Dirac semimetal Pt3Sn layer with a topological surface state. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the unconventional SOT originates from a spin texture with C3v symmetry, leading to significant z&#8208;polarized spin accumulation in the Pt3Sn (111) surface, enabling the deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization. These results highlight the potential of Dirac semimetals like Pt3Sn as scalable and efficient spin sources, facilitating the development of low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density spintronic memory and logic devices.

         <title>Improved Facet and Edge Passivation in Near&#8208;Infrared III&#8208;V Colloidal Quantum Dot Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Increasing InAs CQD size exposes diverse facets and edges, bringing challenges for effective passivation. This work introduces a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy to stabilize these facets and edges, doubling anti&#8208;oxidation ability and boosting mobility. The resulting photodetectors achieve 75% EQE, 10 ns response time, and 50&#160;h operational stability (10% loss) at 1140 nm, advancing InAs CQD photodetector performance.








Abstract
Lead&#8208;free III&#8208;V colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are of significant interest for their potential in near&#8208;infrared (NIR) to short&#8208;wave infrared (SWIR) photodetection. However, achieving effective surface passivation remains challenging, especially as larger CQD sizes introduce more complex surface facets and compositions while shifting the absorption peak from the NIR to the SWIR range. In this study, a mixed&#8208;halide passivation strategy is developed for large InAs CQDs, an approach that led to a doubling in anti&#8208;oxidation ability and achieves a hole mobility of 0.03 cm2&#160;Vs&#8722;1. These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single&#8208;halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.

These in turn led to a T90 lifetime of 50&#160;h and enhanced operating stability in photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations and facet characterization indicate that exposed facets and edges are well passivated using a mixture of indium halides, which provide a stronger desorption energy compared to single-halide passivation. This approach yields photodetectors with an external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 75% and a response time of 10&#160;ns, an advance for InAs photodetectors operating at 1140&#160;nm.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Van der Waals Ferroelectric CuCrP2S6&#8208;Enabled Hysteresis&#8208;Free Negative Capacitance Field&#8208;Effect Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores 2D ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 for developing advanced NC&#8208;FET technology. Using MoS2 as the channel material, NC&#8208;FETs with optimized capacitance matching conditions achieve ultra&#8208;steep subthreshold swings (12 mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis. A resistor&#8208;loaded inverter operating at 0.2 V with hysteresis&#8208;free characteristics highlights the potential of engineered 2D ferroelectrics for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;power electronics.








Abstract
The relentless pursuit of miniaturization and reduced power consumption in information technology demands innovative device architectures. Negative capacitance field&#8208;effect transistors (NC&#8208;FETs) offer a promising solution by harnessing the negative capacitance effect of ferroelectric materials to amplify gate voltage and achieve steep subthreshold swings (SS). In this work, 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectric CuCrP2S6 (CCPS) is employed as the gate dielectric to realize hysteresis&#8208;free NC&#8208;FETs technology. Scanning microwave impedance microscopy (sMIM) is employed to investigate the dielectric property of CCPS, revealing a thickness&#8208;independent dielectric constant of &#8776;35. Subsequently, NC&#8208;FETs are fabricated with MoS2 channel, and the capacitance matching conditions are meticulously investigated. The optimized devices exhibit simultaneously ultra&#8208;steep SS (&#8776;12&#160;mV dec&#8722;1) and negligible hysteresis, with immunity to both voltage scan range and scan rate. Finally, a resistor&#8208;loaded inverter is demonstrated manifesting a low operation voltage down to 0.2&#160;V and hysteresis&#8208;free transfer characteristics. This work paves the way for the development of high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;power electronics by exploiting 2D vdW ferroelectric materials.

The miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery, fabricated by 3&#8208;D printing of living hydrogels containing electroactive Shewanella oneidensis MR&#8208;1 biofilms, represents a novel class of engineered living energy materials. The electricity generated by this device can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals.








Abstract
Harnessing engineered living materials for energy application represents a promising avenue to sustainable energy conversion and storage, with bio&#8208;batteries emerging as a pivotal direction for sustainable power supply. Whereas, the realization of miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery orchestrating off&#8208;the&#8208;shelf devices remains a significant challenge. Here, this work reports the development of a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery using living hydrogels containing conductive biofilms encapsulated in an alginate matrix for nerve stimulation. These hydrogels, which can be 3&#8208;D printed into customized geometries, retained biologically active characteristics, including electroactivity that facilitates electron generation and the reduction of graphene oxide. By fabricating the living hydrogel into a standard 2032 battery shell with a diameter of 20&#160;mm, this work successfully creates a miniaturized and portable bio&#8208;battery with self&#8208;charging performance. The device demonstrates remarkable electrochemical performance with a coulombic efficiency of 99.5% and maintains high cell viability exceeding 90% after operation. Notably, the electricity generated by the bio&#8208;battery can be harnessed for nerve stimulation to enable precise control over bioelectrical stimulation and physiological blood pressure signals. This study paves the way for the development of novel, compact, and portable bio&#8208;energy devices with immense potential for future advancements in sustainable energy technologies.

         <title>Creating Vacancy Strong Interaction to Enable Homogeneous High&#8208;Throughput Ion Transport for Efficient Solid&#8208;State Lithium Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating sulfur&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich tungsten sulfide into composite polymer electrolyte enables homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport (ultra&#8208;high ionic conductivity of 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) and uniform lithium deposition (ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li cells). The sulfurized polyacrylonitrile||Li solid pouch cell exhibits an initial discharge&#8208;specific capacity of 1048 mAh g&#8722;1, resulting in a total capacity of 0.524 Ah.








Abstract
Solid polymer electrolytes are emerging as a key component for solid&#8208;state lithium metal batteries, offering a promising combination of large&#8208;scale processability and high safety. However, challenges remain, including limited ion transport and the unstable solid electrolyte interphase, which result in unsatisfactory ionic conductivity and uncontrollable lithium dendrite growth. To address these issues, a high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport pathway is developed by incorporating tungsten sulfide enriched with sulfur vacancies (SVs) into a poly(vinylidene fluoride&#8208;co&#8208;hexafluoropropylene)&#8208;based composite polymer electrolytes (CPEs). The SVs strong interaction in the CPEs facilitates homogeneous high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ion transport 1.9 &#215; 10&#8722;3 S cm&#8722;1 at 25 &#176;C) by enhancing the dissociation of lithium salts and effectively creates ample interfaces with the polymer chains to reduce the formation of inner vacuities. Moreover, the SVs confine FSI&#8722; anions, while the electron&#8208;rich environment induced by sulfur atoms promotes the preferential degradation of bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide anions, ensuring uniform lithium deposition. This fosters the formation of inorganic nanocrystals on the lithium anode and effectively suppresses dendrite growth, enabling an ultra&#8208;long lifetime of over 5500 h in Li||Li symmetric cells. When paired with sulfurized polyacrylonitrile cathode, a pouch cell capacity of 0.524 Ah is achieved, demonstrating the effectiveness of a homogeneous, high&#8208;throughput Li&#8208;ions transport mechanism.

         <title>Efficient Autonomous Dew Water Harvesting by Laser Micropatterning: Superhydrophilic and High Emissivity Robust Grooved Metallic Surfaces Enabling Filmwise Condensation and Radiative Cooling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Laser micropatterning is presented as a promising technology in the search for autonomous dew water harvesting materials. Laser&#8208;grooved metallic surfaces achieve simultaneously high infrared emissivity and superhydrophilicity, which gives them self&#8208;cooling properties under atmospheric radiative deficit and the ability to condense water in an efficient filmwise fashion. An autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces yields remarkable results.








Abstract
The present work explores a unique yet unexplored synergy between the properties of laser micropatterned metallic surfaces and the requirements for an autonomous dew water harvesting candidate material. Laser&#8208;patterned aluminum surfaces achieved simultaneously high infrared emissivity (up to 0.95 in the atmospheric window) and superhydrophilic wettability (water contact angle of 0&#176;), key properties enabling passive radiative cooling and filmwise condensation dynamics respectively. The generation of micrometric&#8208;sized grooves during laser processing plays a fundamental role in both properties, as they provide a broadband enhancement of the emissivity based on multiscale topographies and oxide layers, while limiting the growth of the water film during condensation through strong capillary wicking forces. As a result, the patterned aluminum surfaces display self&#8208;cooling capacities under radiative deficit conditions as well as low water retention levels (three times lower than the untreated dropwise condensation counterparts). The promising results obtained lead to the construction and evaluation of a real size outdoors autonomous dew water harvesting system based on those surfaces, demonstrating the scalability of the technology. A 70% improvement in the collected dew water in comparison to a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art reference material is consistently measured during 1&#8208;year outdoor study, proving the robustness of the surfaces and their performance.

         <title>Stable and Efficient Indoor Photovoltaics Through Novel Dual&#8208;Phase 2D Perovskite Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The application of 2D perovskite materials in indoor photovoltaic field is studied. By constructing DJ/RP perovskite heterojunction, an optimal balance between defect passivation and carrier transport is achieved. Ultimately, the 2D PSCs attain a PCE of 30.30%, with working stability improved by a factor of 20 compared to 3D PSCs, demonstrating their significant potential in future indoor photovoltaic technology.








Abstract
2D perovskite materials are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaic (IPV) applications due to their tunable bandgap, high absorption coefficients, and enhanced stability. However, attaining uniform crystallization and overcoming low carrier mobility remain key challenges for 2D perovskites, limiting their overall performance. In this study, a 2D perovskite light&#8208;absorbing layer is constructed using a Dion&#8211;Jacobson (DJ)&#8208;phase EDA(FA)4Pb5I16 (n = 5) and introduced butylammonium iodide (BAI) for interface modification, thereby creating a novel DJ/Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper (RP) dual 2D perovskite heterostructure. By adjusting the thickness of the BAI&#8208;based perovskite layer, the relationship between interfacial defect states and carrier mobility is investigated under varying indoor light intensities. The results indicate that, by achieving a balance between interfacial defect passivation and carrier transport, the optimized 2D perovskite device reaches a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 30.30% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 936&#160;mV under 1000 lux (3000 K LED). 2D&#8208;DJ/RP perovskite IPV exhibits a twentyfold increase in T90 lifetime compared to 3D perovskite devices. It is the first time to systematically study 2D perovskites in IPV applications, demonstrating that rationally designed and optimized 2D perovskites hold significant potential for fabricating high&#8208;performance indoor PSCs.

         <title>Manipulating Interfacial Water Via Metallic Pt1Co6 Sites on Self&#8208;Adaptive Metal Phosphides to Enhance Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique electrocatalyst featuring singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, which confers exceptional activity and durability for the hydrogen evolution reaction, enabling high&#8208;performance anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyser, is reported. Real&#8208;time monitoring reveals that these sites self&#8208;adaptively distort under operating conditions to form a Pt1Co6 configuration with strongly negative charge, optimizing reactant binding and reorganizing the interfacial water structure.








Abstract
Metallizing active sites to control the structural and kinetic dissociation of water at the catalyst&#8211;electrolyte interface, along with elucidating its mechanism under operating conditions, is a pivotal innovation for the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Here, a design of singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites in a fully metallic state on nanoporous Co2P, tailored for HER, is introduced. An anion&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water electrolyzer equipped with this catalyst can achieve the industrial current densities of 1.0 and 2.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 1.71 and 1.85&#160;V, respectively. It is revealed that the singly dispersed Pt&#8211;Co sites undergo self&#8208;adaptive distortion under operating conditions, which form a Pt1Co6 configuration with a strongly negative charge that optimizes reactant binding and reorganizes the interfacial water structure, resulting in an improved concentration of potassium (K+) ions in the closest ion plane. The K+ ions interact cooperatively with H2O (K&#183;H2O), which strengthens the Pt&#8211;H binding interaction and facilitates the polarization of the H&#9472;OH bond, leading to improved HER activity. This study not only propels the advancement of cathodic catalysts for water electrolysis but also delineates a metallization strategy and an interface design principle, thereby enhancing electrocatalytic reaction rates.

         <title>Enhanced Reversibility of Iron Metal Anode with a Solid Electrolyte Interphase in Concentrated Chloride Electrolytes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The low plating&#8208;stripping Coulombic efficiency of the iron metal anode is a major barrier for next&#8208;generation Fe&#8208;ion batteries. Introducing a high concentration of ZnCl2 to the FeCl2&#8208;based electrolyte makes the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase&#8208;enabling dimethyl carbonate miscible to the electrolyte. The hybrid electrolyte exhibits an average Coulombic efficiency of 98.3% and a more stable cycle life.








Abstract
Iron is a promising candidate for a cost&#8208;effective anode for large&#8208;scale energy storage systems due to its natural abundance and well&#8208;established mass production. Recently, Fe&#8208;ion batteries (FeIBs) that use ferrous ions as the charge carrier have emerged as a potential storage solution. The electrolytes in FeIBs are necessarily acidic to render the ferrous ions more anodically stable, allowing a wide operation voltage window. However, the iron anode suffers severe hydrogen evolution reaction with a low Coulombic efficiency (CE) in an acidic environment, shortening the battery cycle life. Herein, a hybrid aqueous electrolyte that forms a solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer on the Fe anode surface is introduced. The electrolyte mainly comprises FeCl2 and ZnCl2 as cosalts, where the Zn&#8208;Cl anionic complex species of the concentrated ZnCl2 allows dimethyl carbonate (DMC) to be miscible with the aqueous ferrous electrolyte. SEI derived from DMC's decomposition passivates the iron surface, which leads to an average CE of 98.3% and much&#8208;improved cycling stability. This advancement shows the promise of efficient and durable FeIBs.

         <title>Binary Electrolyte Additive&#8208;Reinforced Interfacial Molecule Adsorption Layer for Ultra&#8208;Stable Zinc Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A natural binary electrolyte additive is designed to achieve an enhanced interfacial molecule adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double&#8208;layer structure. Consequently, the hydrogen evolution reaction is suppressed and a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase is constructed for dendrite&#8208;free Zn plating. The zinc ion hybrid capacitor with binary additive demonstrates an exceptional lifespan of over 100&#160;000 cycles.









Abstract
Aqueous zinc ion batteries (AZIBs) face challenges due to the limited interface stability of Zn anode, which includes uncontrolled hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and excessive dendrite growth. In this study, a natural binary additive composed of saponin and anisaldehyde is introduced to create a stable interfacial adsorption layer for Zn protection via reshaping the electric double layer (EDL) structure. Saponin with rich hydroxyl and carboxyl groups serves as &#8220;anchor points&#8221;, promoting the adsorption of anisaldehyde through intermolecular hydrogen bonding. Meanwhile, anisaldehyde, with a unique aldehyde group, enhances HER suppression by preferentially facilitating electrocatalytic coupling with H* in the EDL, leading to the formation of a robust inorganic solid electrolyte interphase that prevents dendrite formation, and structural evolution of anisaldehyde during Zn deposition process is verified. As a result, the Zn||Zn symmetric cells present an ultra&#8208;long cycling lifespan of 3&#160;400&#160;h at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 1&#160;700&#160;h at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Even at the current density of 20&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the cells demonstrate reversible operations for 450&#160;h. Furthermore, Zn&#8208;ion hybrid capacitors exhibit a remarkable lifespan of 100&#160;000 cycles. This work presents a simple synergetic strategy to enhance anode/electrolyte interfacial stability, highlighting its potential for Zn anode protection in high&#8208;performance AZIBs.

         <title>Ir/Mn Co&#8208;Mixing and Oxide&#8208;Support Interaction Modulation Through Plasma Promoted Asymmetric Oxygen Coupling for Stable Acidic Oxygen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction modulation through plasma defect engineering is used for the development of the catalysts that follow the oxide path mechanism for the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER). The obtained catalyst shows exceptional OER activity and remarkable stability in the acid media.








Abstract
Developing efficient and stable catalysts that facilitate the oxygen&#8208;evolution reaction (OER) through an oxide&#8208;path mechanism (OPM) is of considerable interest. However, it remains a significant challenge due to the stringent structural requirements of these catalysts. This work reports that using a strategy that integrates the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and the strong oxide&#8208;support interaction (SOSI) modulation, efficient and stable Ir&#8208;based catalysts that follow the OPM for the acidic OER can be developed. The strategy mainly relies on optimizing the distance of oxygeneous intermediate adsorption sites by the Ir/Mn co&#8208;mixing and modulating the SOSI of the catalysts through plasma defect engineering to trigger the OPM pathway with a lower energy barrier. The density&#8208;functional&#8208;theory (DFT) calculations reveal a strong electronic coupling between Ir and Mn via the Ir&#9472;O&#9472;Mn bond and a ready coupling of oxygeneous adsorbed on the Ir site with those on the Mn site, leading to an asymmetric oxygen coupling for the OER. The developed catalyst merely requires an overpotential of 240&#160;mV to drive 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with the Ir mass&#8208;activity &gt;&#160;75 times higher than that of the IrO2. When used in the proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane water&#8208;electrolyzers, it shows high performance and excellent stability at an industrial&#8208;level current density of 1.0 A cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Molecular Stitching in Polysaccharide Precursor for Fabricating Hard Carbon with Ultra&#8208;High Plateau Capacity of Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work opens the avenue to molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network in the precursor is constructed by unique molecular stitching strategy. The network evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices with abundant&#160;closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3 nm), thereby&#160;enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters in hard carbon.








Abstract
High energy density of sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs) requires high low&#8208;voltage capacity and initial Coulombic efficiency for hard carbon. However, simultaneously achieving both characteristics is a substantial challenge. Herein, a unique molecular stitching strategy is proposed to edit the polymeric structure of common starch for synthesizing cost&#8208;effective hard carbon (STHC&#8208;MS). A mild air&#8208;heating treatment toward starch is employed to trigger the esterification reaction between carboxyl and hydroxy groups, which can effectively connect the branched polysaccharide chains thereby constructing a highly cross&#8208;linked polymeric network. In contrast with the pristine branched&#8208;chain starch, the cross&#8208;linking structured precursor evolves into highly twisted graphitic lattices creating a large population of closed ultramicro&#8208;pores (&lt;0.3&#160;nm) enabling the storage of massive sodium clusters. Resultantly, STHC&#8208;MS delivers a reversible capacity of 348 mAh g&#8722;1 with a remarkable low&#8208;voltage (below 0.1&#160;V) capacity of 294 mAh g&#8722;1, which becomes more attractive by combining the high initial Coulombic efficiency of 93.3%. Moreover, STHC&#8208;MS exhibits outstanding stability of 0.008% decay per cycle over 4800 cycles at 1 A g&#8722;1. STHC&#8208;MS||Na3V2(PO3)4 full cells achieve an energy density of 266&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1, largely surpassing the commercial hard carbon&#8208;based counterpart. This work opens the avenue of molecular&#8208;level modulation in organic precursors for developing high&#8208;performance hard carbon in SIBs.

         <title>Dynamic Bonding for In&#8208;Situ Welding of Multilayer Elastomers Enables High&#8208;Performance Wearable Electronics for Machine Learning&#8208;Assisted Active Rehabilitation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds to integrate multilayer conductive elastomers into robust wearable electronics with superior structural stability and excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance. The data reflecting resistance training are collected by the welded electronics and further analysed and classified by machine learning models, which enables home&#8208;based active rehabilitation.








Abstract
Patients with hand dysfunction require joint rehabilitation for functional restoration, and wearable electronics can provide physical signals to assess and guide the process. However, most wearable electronics are susceptible to failure under large deformations owing to instability in the layered structure, thereby weakening signal reliability. Herein, an in&#8208;situ self&#8208;welding strategy that uses dynamic hydrogen bonds at interfaces to integrate conductive elastomer layers into highly robust electronics is proposed. This strategy enables the interlocking of functional layers with different microstructures, achieving high interfacial toughness (e.g., &#8776;700&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2 for micropyramid layer with the smallest welding areas) and preventing structural failure. The welded electronics exhibit excellent pressure&#8208;sensing performance, including high sensitivity, a wide sensing range, and excellent long&#8208;term stability, surpassing those of the unwelded electronics. This enables a reliable collection of comprehensive pressure signals during joint rehabilitation, which is beneficial for assessing the rehabilitation levels of a patient. Furthermore, a machine learning&#8208;assisted system using t&#8208;distributed stochastic neighbor embedding and artificial neural network models to facilitate home&#8208;based active rehabilitation is established, which reduces the need for frequent hospital visits. This system analyzes and quantifies rehabilitation levels in a timely manner, allowing patients to adjust training programs autonomously, thereby accelerating the rehabilitation process.

         <title>Shape&#8208;Controlled Reversible Li Plating&#8208;Stripping for Stable and High&#8208;Rate Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode composed of highly ordered hollow ZnO matrix with surface&#8208;protective LiPON layer is developed, which achieves a highly reversible Li plating/stripping inside the matrix cavity for long life&#8208;span anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries with high energy density.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;free lithium metal batteries are promising toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density power sources with low&#8208;cost, but their practical applications are challenged by poor cycling stability and low rate capability. Herein, a shape change&#8208;free and lithium&#8208;free anode that well controls the reversible Li plating&#8208;stripping is reported, which is composed of a highly&#8208;ordered hollow ZnO matrix with a surface&#8208;coated lithium&#8208;phosphorus&#8208;oxynitride (LiPON) layer. The ZnO matrix supplies sufficient cavities and lithiophilic sites to facilitate uniform Li plating/stripping within the hollow cavity, while the LiPON layer maintains stable solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase from mechanical and electrochemical damage. As a result, lithium is constrained within the cavity and the overall anode shape is effectively controlled during long&#8208;term and high&#8208;rate cycling. The assembled half&#8208;cell stably works at 1.2&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 335 cycles with Coulombic efficiency of 98.8%. Without Li pre&#8208;deposition, full&#8208;cells using modified&#8208;LiFePO4 and LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 cathodes demonstrate 150&#8208;cycles lifespan and high energy density of 617&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 2C rate.

         <title>Operando Magnetism on Oxygen Redox Process in Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ magnetism measurement is employed to investigate the magnetic/electronic structure evolution in the Li&#8208;rich cathode. The magnetization changes demonstrate that charge storage behavior originates from synergistic transition metal spin&#8208;state variation and &#960;&#8208;to&#8208;&#963; interaction evolution, and further elucidate the internal origin of capacity decay during cycling. The Mn&#9472;O orbital model provides potential criteria for oxygen redox, guiding rational design of anionic redox&#8208;based cathodes.








Abstract
Oxide ions in lithium&#8208;rich layered oxides can store charge at high voltage and offer a viable route toward the higher energy density batteries. However, the underlying oxygen redox mechanism in such materials still remains elusive at present. In this work, a precise in situ magnetism measurement is employed to monitor real&#8208;time magnetization variation associated with unpaired electrons in Li1.2Mn0.6Ni0.2O2 cathode material, enabling the investigation on magnetic/electronic structure evolution in electrochemical cycling. The magnetization gradually decreases except for a weak upturn above 4.6&#160;V during the initial charging process. According to the comprehensive analyses of various in/ex situ characterizations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the magnetization rebound can be attributed to the interaction evolution of lattice oxygen from &#960;&#8208;type delocalized Mn&#9472;O coupling to &#963;&#8208;type O&#9472;O dimerization bonding. Moreover, the magnetization amplitude attenuation after long&#8208;term cycles provides important evidence for the irreversible structure transition and capacity fading. The oxygen redox mechanism concluded by in situ magnetism characterization can be generalized to other electrode materials with an anionic redox process and provide pivotal guidance for designing advanced high&#8208;performance cathode materials.

         <title>Emergent Multiple Spin States From Baromagnetic Effect in Strongly Correlated Magnet Mn&#8323;GaC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC, controllable multiple spin states with giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, which can enhance magnetic storage, are achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane through applied pressure. These multiple spin states originate from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization.








Abstract
Strongly correlated magnets, exhibiting distinctive spin properties such as spin&#8208;orbit coupling, spin polarization, and chiral spin, are regarded as the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;density magnetic storage materials in spintronics. Nevertheless, owing to intricate spin interactions, realizing controllable spin arrangement and high&#8208;density magnetic storage remains a formidable challenge. Here, controllable multiple spin states induced by the baromagnetic effect in kagome lattice magnet Mn&#8323;GaC are first reported, achieved by manipulating spin rotation within the spin&#8208;polarized plane employing pressure. Neutron diffraction refinement and specific heat measurements under pressure, combined with first&#8208;principles calculations, demonstrate that multiple spin states are originating from the synergistic mechanism between spin frustration and spin polarization related to the lifting of degeneracy in electronic microstates. Electrical transport measurements under pressure reveal that multiple spin states exhibit giant baro&#8208;magnetoresistance effect, enabling enhanced storage density in spintronics via multi&#8208;logic state applications. Integrating the pressure response and microscopic behaviors of spins, a comprehensive p&#8208;T&#8208;H phase diagram is constructed, offering a novel and robust framework for multi&#8208;logic states. These findings provide critical insights into controllable spin states, opening a new avenue for high&#8208;density magnetic storage through multiple spin states.

         <title>Discovery of a New Cu&#8208;Based Chalcogenide with High zT Near Room Temperature: Low&#8208;Cost Alternative for the Bi2Te3&#8208;Based Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports the discovery of a stable &#947;&#8208;phase in Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x, achieving high thermoelectric performance with a Seebeck coefficient up to 200 &#181;VK&#8315;&#185; and ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8315;&#185;K&#8315;&#185;). The material eliminates phase transitions, exhibits a zT of &#8776;1.1 at 500 K, and offers a cost&#8208;effective, eco&#8208;friendly alternative for waste heat recovery and cooling applications.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based chalcogenides are cost&#8208;effective and environmentally friendly thermoelectric (TE) materials for waste heat recovery. Despite demonstrating excellent thermoelectric performance, binary Cu2X (X&#160;=&#160;S, Se, and Te) chalcogenides undergo superionic phase transitions above room temperature, leading to microstructural evolution and unstable properties. In this work, a new &#947;&#8208;phase of Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x (0&#160;&lt;&#160;x &#8804;&#160;1) is discovered, a narrow&#8208;bandgap semiconductor with outstanding thermoelectric performance and high stability. By substituting Te with S in metallic Cu6Te3S, the crystal symmetry is modified and structural phase transitions are eliminated. The &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits a significantly higher Seebeck coefficient of up to 200&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 compared to 8.8&#160;&#181;VK&#8722;1 for Cu6Te3S at room temperature due to optimized carrier concentration and increased effective mass. Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x materials also demonstrate ultralow thermal conductivity (&#8776;0.25 Wm&#8722;1K&#8722;1), which, in concert with improved power factors, enables a high zT of &#8776;1.1 at a relatively low temperature of 500&#160;K. Unlike most Cu&#8208;based chalcogenides, the &#947;&#8208;phase exhibits excellent transport property stability across multiple thermal cycles, making it a cost&#8208;effective and eco&#8208;friendly alternative to Bi2Te3&#8208;based materials. The developed Cu6Te3&#8208;xS1+x is a promising candidate for thermoelectric converters in waste heat recovery, and its potential can be further extended to cooling applications through carrier concentration tuning.

         <title>Phase and Orbital Engineering Effectuating Efficient Adsorption and Catalysis toward High&#8208;Energy Lithium&#8722;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C catalyst, constructed through a phase and orbital engineering strategy, significantly enhances its catalytic activity by restructuring the basal surface for the conversion of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. Consequently, c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C&#8208;based batteries exhibit elevated capacity, excellent rate capability, and stable cycling life.








Abstract
The delicate construction of electrocatalysts with high catalytic activity is a strategic method to enhance the kinetics of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs). Adjusting the local structure of the catalyst is always crucial for understanding the structure&#8211;activity relationship between atomic structure and catalyst performance. Here, in situ induction of electron&#8208;deficient B enables phase engineering Mo2C, realizing the transition from hexagonal (h&#8208;Mo2C) to cubic phase (c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C). Meanwhile, the empty sp3 orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron&#8208;rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based cell achieves a low&#8208;capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li+ transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah&#8208;c&#8208;B&#8208;Mo2C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&#8722;1 (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg S&#8722;1), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&#8722;1 more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.

Meanwhile, the empty sp&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; orbital of B favors the effective bonding with electron-rich sulfur, creates a more valid orbital engineering available. Relying on the binary engineering via B doping, the adsorption and conversion of polysulfides are promoted. Hence, the &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-B-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C based cell achieves a low-capacity degradation of 0.04% with the coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.8% in 1000 cycles. Uniform Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport is consistently achieved at 2 mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for over 600 h. A 6.67Ah-&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt;-B-Mo&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C based pouch cell has a high energy density of up to 502.1 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; (E/S ratio of 2.4 &#181;L mg &lt;sub&gt;S&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), while the pouch cell of 2 Ah exhibits an energy density of 372 Wh kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; more than 100 cycles. This study takes advantage of the combined engineering method to provide a guiding approach for elevating the activity of the electrocatalysts rationally.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Traversing the Periodic Table through Phase&#8208;Separating Nanoreactors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;scale arrays of single nanoparticles, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography or Polymer Pen Lithography, allow for the discovery of novel nanomaterials at an unprecedented scale. The development of phase&#8208;separating hydrophobic nanoreactors bypasses element&#8208;specific chemistry limitations, enabling the synthesis of polyelemental metal and metal oxide nanoparticle megalibraries from at least 52 metal elements with an almost infinite number of chemical combinations in a single experiment.








Abstract
Phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors, generated through either Dip Pen Nanolithography (DPN)&#160;or Polymer Pen Lithography (PPL) and capable of single nanoparticle formation, are compatible with almost every relevant element from the periodic table. This advance overcomes one of the most daunting limitations in high throughput materials discovery, specifically enabling the synthesis of broad swaths of the materials genome. Indeed, the platform is compatible with at least 52 metal elements of interest and almost an infinite number of combinations. In particular, it is discovered that surface&#8208;confined, attoliter&#8208;volume reactors made of polystyrene (PS) mixtures can be preloaded with metal salts spanning all but the alkali metals and subsequently transformed into single&#8208; or multi&#8208;component nanoparticles of well&#8208;defined dimensions. This is done in a three&#8208;step process, which initially involves the facilitation of precursor precipitation and localization with toluene vapor, followed by plasma treatment to remove the polymer reactor component, and then heating from 400&#8211;900&#160;&#176;C, depending upon precursor and desired end&#8208;state (degree of reduction and crystallinity). These phase&#8208;separating nanoreactors are used to produce metal and metal oxide nanoparticles, depending upon conditions, in a substrate&#8208;general manner.

         <title>Chiral Pseudogap Metal Emerging from a Disordered Van der Waals Mott Insulator 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intriguing metal was discovered in a chiral charge density wave material, 1T&#8208;TaS2. The random substitution of S by Se induces a transition from an insulator to a metal with a strongly suppressed electron density at the Fermi energy. The pseudogap comes from electronic disorder on with substantial electron correlation and exhibits unprecedented chirality, which may induce exotic superconductivity. 








Abstract
The emergence of a pseudogap is a hallmark of anomalous electronic states formed through substantial manybody interaction but the mechanism of the pseudogap formation and its role in related emerging quantum states such as unconventional superconductivity remain largely elusive. Here, the emergence of an unusual pseudogap in a representative van der Waals chiral charge density wave (CDW) materials with strong electron correlation, 1T&#8208;TaS2 is reported, through isoelectronic substitute of S. The evolution of electronic band dispersions of 1T&#8208;TaS2 &#8722; xSex (0 &#10877; x &#10877; 2) is systematically investigated using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). The results show that the Se substitution induces a quantum transition from an insulating to a pseudogap metallic phase with the CDW order preserved. Moreover, the asymmetry of the pseudogap spectral function is found, which reflects the chiral nature of CDW structure. The present observation is contrasted with the previous suggestions of a Mott transition driven by band width control or charge transfer. Instead, the pseudogap phase is attributed to a disordered Mott insulator in line with the recent observation of substantial lateral electronic disorder. These findings provide a unique electronic system with chiral pseudogap, where the complex interplay between CDW, chirality, disorder, and electronic correlation may lead to unconventional emergent&#160;physics.

         <title>Orbital Matching Mechanism&#8208;Guided Synthesis of Cu&#8208;Based Single Atom Alloys for Acidic CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is proposed for assessing the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based single atom alloys (SAAs). This theoretical framework offers electronic orbital insights into stability factors and is universally applicable for designing stable SAAs. The designed SAAs are experimentally demonstrated with enhanced mono&#8208;carbon product selectivity in a prototype reaction&#8212;acidic CO2 electroreduction.








Abstract
Recent advancements in alloy catalysis have yield novel materials with tailored functionalities. Among these, Cu&#8208;based single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalysts have attracted significant attention in catalytic applications for their unique electronic structure and geometric ensemble effects. However, selecting alloying atoms with robust dispersion stability on the Cu substrate is challenging, and has mostly been practiced empirically. The fundamental bottleneck is that the microscopic mechanism that governs the dispersion stability is unclear, and a comprehensive approach for designing Cu&#8208;based SAA systems with simultaneous dispersion stability and high catalytic activity is still missing. Here, combining theory and experiment, a simple yet intuitive d&#8208;p orbital matching mechanism is discovered for rapid assessment of the atomic dispersion stability of Cu&#8208;based SAAs, exhibiting its universality and extensibility for screening effective SAAs across binary, ternary and multivariant systems. The catalytic selectivity of the newly designed SAAs is demonstrated in a prototype reaction&#8208;acidic CO2 electroreduction, where all SAAs achieve single&#8208;carbon product selectivity exceeding 70%, with Sb1Cu reaching a peak CO faradaic efficiency of 99.73 &#177; 2.5% at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. This work establishes the fundamental design principles for Cu&#8208;based SAAs with excellent dispersion stability and selectivity, and will boost the development of ultrahigh&#8208;performance SAAs for advanced applications such as electrocatalysis.

         <title>CNT&#8208;Supported RuNi Composites Enable High Round&#8208;Trip Efficiency in Regenerative Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
RuNi composites are constructed on surface&#8208;functionalized carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and demonstrated as a multifunctional electrocatalyst for both alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrolysis. The exceptional catalytic activity and multifunctionality of the catalyst composites across all key reactions enable a regenerative fuel cell system to achieve high round&#8208;trip efficiency at industrial&#8208;level current densities.








Abstract
Regenerative fuel cells hold significant potential for efficient, large&#8208;scale energy storage by reversibly converting electrical energy into hydrogen and vice versa, making them essential for leveraging intermittent renewable energy sources. However, their practical implementation is hindered by the unsatisfactory efficiency. Addressing this challenge requires the development of cost&#8208;effective electrocatalysts. In this study, a carbon nanotube (CNT)&#8208;supported RuNi composite with low Ru loading is developed as an efficient and stable catalyst for alkaline hydrogen and oxygen electrocatalysis, including hydrogen evolution, oxygen evolution, hydrogen oxidation, and oxygen reduction reaction. Furthermore, a regenerative fuel cell using this catalyst composite is assembled and evaluated under practical relevant conditions. As anticipated, the system exhibits outstanding performance in both the electrolyzer and fuel cell modes. Specifically, it achieves a low cell voltage of 1.64&#160;V to achieve a current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2 for the electrolyzer mode and delivers a high output voltage of 0.52&#160;V at the same current density in fuel cell mode, resulting in a round&#8208;trip efficiency (RTE) of 31.6% without further optimization. The multifunctionality, high activity, and impressive RTE resulted by using the RuNi catalyst composites underscore its potential as a single catalyst for regenerative fuel cells.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Retina by Regulating Ion&#8208;Confined Transport in Hydrogels</title>

An ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is developed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina that processes information through synaptic mechanisms, enabling precise modulation of optical signals. By integrating both inhibitory and excitatory artificial synapses, the system effectively processes various vision tasks, including image recognition, dynamic motion analysis, and path planning for robot vehicles.








Abstract
The effective and precise processing of visual information by the human eye primarily relies on the diverse contrasting functions achieved through synaptic regulation of ion transport in the retina. Developing a bio&#8208;inspired retina that uses ions as information carriers can more accurately replicate retina's natural signal processing capabilities, enabling high&#8208;performance machine vision. Herein, an ion&#8208;confined transport strategy is proposed to construct a bio&#8208;inspired retina by developing artificial synapses with inhibitory and excitatory contrasting functions. By fine&#8208;tuning the ionic hydrogel structures to control ion transport across the heterogeneous interfaces, inhibitory and excitatory synapses are realized to negatively or positively modulate the optical signal. The integration of these synapses facilitates advanced tasks such as image recognition and motion analysis. Moreover, as a proof of concept, guiding robot vehicles to perform path planning is demonstrated. This work offers a new idea for constructing the bio&#8208;inspired retina by precisely regulating ion transport, allowing it to reach a level closer to the biological retina.

         <title>Giant Non&#8208;Saturating Exchange Striction in a Noncollinear Antiferromagnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;quality single crystals of the noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn are synthesized, and a non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm under 57 T is observed, surpassing the giant magnetostriction materials such as FeGa. The theoretical analyses indicate that this pronounced non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction stems from an exotic exchange striction mechanism, which facilitates a linear relationship between strain output and applied magnetic field.








Abstract
Magnetostriction, discovered by Joule in 1842, refers to the mechanical strain that a material undergoes in the presence of a magnetic field. Conventionally, it originates from the spin&#8208;orbit coupling and has been predominantly explored in ferromagnets. In this work, a giant magnetostriction effect is reported in the high&#8208;quality single crystal of a noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn. Non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction exceeding 400&#160;ppm is obtained, which is even larger than the saturation values of the well&#8208;known Fe&#8208;based giant magnetostriction ferromagnetic materials such as FeGa. Theoretical calculations reveal that the large non&#8208;saturating magnetostriction results from a sophisticated exchange striction effect of the noncollinear antiferromagnetic spin structure, leading to a nearly linear dependence of the strain output on the applied magnetic field. This work provides an unprecedented strategy to design next&#8208;generation magnetoelastic materials with noncollinear compensated spin structures.

         <title>Ultrafast Superradiant Scintillation from Isolated Weakly Confined Perovskite Nanocrystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efficiency and scintillation velocity are critical for high&#8208;energy and medical physics. These parameters, typically conflicting in conventional scintillators, are simultaneously optimized by exploiting the giant oscillator strength of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals, leading to radiatively accelerated (multi)excitonic emission with unity efficiency without detrimental light transport losses in polymeric nanocomposites. This opens up interesting developments in fast&#8208;timing radiation detection based on colloidal nanocrystals.








Abstract
Efficiency and emission rate are two traditionally conflicting parameters in radiation detection, and achieving their simultaneous maximization can significantly advance ultrafast time&#8208;of&#8208;flight (ToF) technologies. In this study, it is demonstrated that this goal is attainable by harnessing the giant oscillator strength (GOS) inherent to weakly confined perovskite nanocrystals, which enables superradiant scintillation under mildly cryogenic conditions that align seamlessly with ToF technologies. It is shown that the radiative acceleration due to GOS encompasses both single and multiple exciton dynamics arising from ionizing interactions, further enhanced by suppressed non&#8208;radiative losses and Auger recombination at 80 K. The outcome is ultrafast scintillation with 420&#160;ps lifetime and light yield of &#8776;10&#160;000 photons/MeV for diluted NC solutions, all without non&#8208;radiative losses. Temperature&#8208;dependent light&#8208;guiding experiments on test&#8208;bed nanocomposite scintillators finally indicate that the light&#8208;transport capability remains unaffected by the accumulation of band&#8208;edge oscillator strength due to GOS. These findings suggest a promising pathway toward developing ultrafast nanotechnological scintillators with optimized light output and timing performance.

         <title>Regulating Electron Distribution in Regioisomeric Covalent Organic Frameworks for Efficient Solar&#8208;Driven Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Two regioisomeric COFs incorporating the thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moiety are synthesized for photocatalytic H2O2 production. The &#946;&#8208;isomer exhibits exceptional performance compared to the &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart due to optimized electron distribution, enhance charge transfer efficiency, and precise alignment of excited&#8208;state electrons with the ORR active site, demonstrating the great potential of leveraging regioisomerism in COF design.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are emerging as a transformative platform for photocatalytic hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production due to their highly ordered structures, intrinsic porosity, and molecular tunability. Despite their potential, the inefficient utilization of photogenerated charge carriers in COFs significantly restrains their photocatalytic efficiency. This study presents two regioisomeric COFs, &#945;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF and &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF, both incorporating thieno[3,2&#8208;b]thiophene moieties, to investigate the influence of regioisomerism on the excited electron distribution and its impact on photocatalytic performance. The &#946;&#8208;TT&#8208;TDAN COF demonstrates a remarkable solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical conversion efficiency of 1.35%, outperforming its &#945;&#8208;isomeric counterpart, which is merely 0.44%. Comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations reveal the critical role of subtle substitution change in COFs on their electronic properties. This structural adjustment intricately connects molecular structure to charge dynamics, enabling precise regulation of electron distribution, efficient charge separation and transport, and localization of excited electrons at active sites. Moreover, this finely tuned interplay significantly enhances the efficiency of the oxygen reduction reaction. These findings establish a new paradigm in COF design, offering a molecular&#8208;level strategy to advance COFs and reticular materials toward highly efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion.

In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal&#8208;plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.








Abstract
The in situ repair of oxidized copper (Cu) surfaces while constructing a superior protective layer is critical for sustainable development and the efficient utilization of metallic materials. Here, a simple solvothermal treatment is presented to repair oxidized Cu surfaces (Cu foils, nanowires, and nanocubes) and reconstruct an antioxidant layer with an ordered (111) crystal&#8208;plane (Cu&#8208;SC) in situ. Electrochemical measurements reveal that the corrosion rate of Cu&#8208;SC in 0.1&#160;m NaOH is reduced to 1.99 &#215; 10&#8722;3&#160;mm yr&#8722;&#185;, a fivefold improvement over pristine Cu (1.00 &#215; 10&#8722;2 mm yr&#8722;&#185;). Density functional theory calculations confirm that the reconstructed (111) surface reduces oxygen molecule adsorption, significantly hinders oxygen atom diffusion into the bulk and continuous adsorption on surface. Anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels fabricated from Cu&#8208;SC nanowires exhibit exceptional durability, retaining reliable authentication accuracy after 144&#160;h at 85&#160;&#176;C/85% relative humidity and 2000 bending cycles. The enhanced anti&#8208;oxidation properties of Cu&#8208;SC ensure the stability of its microstructures, which are critical for deep learning&#8208;based authentication, allowing precise feature extraction and accurate label verification even under extreme conditions. These results highlight the potential of (111) surface reconstruction for enhancing material stability, enabling advanced anti&#8208;counterfeiting applications, and promoting the sustainable utilization of metallic materials.

&lt;p&gt;In situ repair and surface reconstruction of oxidized copper (Cu) (Cu foil, Cu nanowires, Cu nanoparticles) is achieved by solvothermal reaction. The experimental data and Density functional theory calculations demonstrate that (111) crystal-plane reconstruction enhances the oxidation resistance of the metal, and the method is equally applicable to the Ag nanomaterials (Ag nanowires, Ag nanocubes), which also exhibits good oxidation resistance.

         <title>Suspension Electrolytes with Catalytically Self&#8208;Expediating Desolvation Kinetics for Low&#8208;Temperature Zinc Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The CeO2&#8208;x&#8208;suspension electrolyte is initially proposed to regulate the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure and alters the inner Helmholtz plane to accelerate Zn[(H2O)6]2+ desolvation, achieving a homogenized electric field and uniform ion flux kinetics. Consequently, the suspen sion electrolyte achieves a service life exceeding 6500 h at 0&#160;&#176;C and demonstrates outstanding rate performance at &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, highlighting its practical potential for AZMBs.








Abstract
The conventional electrolyte for rechargeable aqueous zinc metal batteries (AZMBs) breeds many problems such as Zn dendrite growth and side reaction of hydrogen evolution reaction, which are fundamentally attributed to the uneven ion flux owing to the high barriers of desolvation and diffusion of Zn[(H2O)6]2+ clusters. Herein, to modulate the [Zn(H2O)6]2+ solvation structure, the suspension electrolyte engineering employed with electron&#8208;delocalized catalytic nanoparticles is initially proposed to expedite desolvation kinetics. As a proof, the electron&#8208;density&#8208;adjustable CeO2&#8208;x is introduced into the commercial electrolyte and preferentially adsorbed on the Zn surface, regulating the Zn[(H2O)6]2+ structure. Meanwhile, the defect&#8208;rich CeO2&#8208;x redistributes the localized space electric field to uniformize ion flux kinetics and inhibits dendrite growth, as confirmed by a series of theoretical simulations, spectroscopical and experimental measurements. Encouragingly, the CeO2&#8208;x decorated suspension electrolyte enables a long stability over 1200 cycles at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 and an extended lifespan exceeding 6500 h with lower overpotentials of 34 mV under 0&#160;&#176;C. Matched with polyaniline cathodes, the full cells with suspension electrolyte exhibit a capacity&#8208;retention of 96.75% at 1 A g&#8722;1 under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C as well as a long lifespan of up to 400 cycles in a large&#8208;areal pouch cell, showcasing promising potentials of suspension electrolyte for practical AZMBs.

         <title>Synergetic Oxidized Mg and Mo Sites on Amorphous Ru Metallene Boost Hydrogen Evolution Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The sluggish water&#8208;splitting step hinders the advancement of alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), making the design of efficient water&#8208;splitting active sites critical. The MgOx and MoOy on the atomically thin Ru metallene can cooperatively promote the adsorption&#8211;dissociation of water molecules, greatly promoting the efficiency of alkaline HER.








Abstract
Ruthenium (Ru) is considered as a promising catalyst for the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), yet its weak water adsorption ability hinders the water splitting efficiency. Herein, a concept of introducing the oxygenophilic MgOx and MoOy species onto amorphous Ru metallene is demonstrated through a simple one&#8208;pot salt&#8208;templating method for the synergic promotion of water adsorption and splitting to greatly enhance the alkaline HER electrocatalysis. The atomically thin MgOx and MoOy species on Ru metallene (MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru) show a 15.3&#8208;fold increase in mass activity for HER at the potential of 100&#160;mV than that of Ru metallene and an ultralow overpotential of 8.5&#160;mV at a current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. It is further demonstrated that the MgOx/MoOy&#8208;Ru&#8208;based anion exchange membrane water electrolyzer can achieve a high current density of 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a remarkably low cell voltage of 1.55&#160;V, and exhibit excellent durability of over 60&#160;h at a current density of 500&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical simulations reveal that the co&#8208;introduction of MgOx and MoOy enhances interfacial water adsorption and splitting by promoting adsorption on oxidized Mg sites and lowering the dissociation&#160;energy barrier on oxidized Mo sites.

         <title>Controlled Modulation of Intrinsic Electron Response in C/CoxTy Nanoplates Toward Multispectral Excitation Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the C/CoxTy nanoplates with high&#8208;efficiency and tunable electromagnetic properties are successfully prepared by customizing Co&#8208;based nanoparticles. Relying on these C/CoxTy nanoplates, a series of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices are developed, opening up a new era of multispectral electromagnetic devices.








Abstract
Electromagnetic materials with adjustable dielectric and magnetic properties are constantly sought after in electronic and industrial fields. In this study, an innovative strategy that customizes anchored Co&#8208;based nanoparticles to optimize the electronic behaviors is proposed for the first time, enabling a controllable and high&#8208;efficiency evolution of the macroscopic electromagnetic response of Co&#8208;based (C/CoxTy) nanoplates across the X&#8208;ray, light in the solar band and gigahertz band. Specifically, in the gigahertz band, the C/Co and C/Co3Se4 nanoplates with high&#8208;power loss capabilities can effectively attenuate and convert electromagnetic energy into heat energy, which not only prevents space electromagnetic radiation but also powers energy for various electromagnetic devices such as thermoelectric generators and microwave actuators. Moreover, multiband antennas and ultra&#8208;wideband bandstop filters are successfully achieved and flexibly tuned. Meanwhile, C/CoxTy nanoplates photo&#8208; and X&#8208;ray detectors are constructed successfully. Additionally, the C/CoTe nanoplate X&#8208;ray detector, featuring remarkable stability, sensitivity and penetrability, is successfully utilized to construct the interaction system integrating communication and imaging. In summary, this work offers an effective way for flexible regulation of multispectral electromagnetic response, significantly advancing the development of multispectral electromagnetic functional devices.

         <title>Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis of Early Colorectal Cancerization via Amplified Sensing of MicroRNA&#8208;21 in NIR&#8208;II Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

An amplified sensing strategy is reported in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900 nm) window for non&#8208;invasivel in situ visualization of early cancerization biomarker miRNA&#8208;21, providing a promising alternative for early diagnosis of cancerization and a guidance for therapeutic management.








Abstract
Accurate, sensitive, and in situ visualization of aberrant expression level of low&#8208;abundant biomolecules is crucial for early colorectal cancer (CRC) detection ahead of tumor morphology change. However, the clinical used colonoscopy and biopsy methods are invasive and lack of sensitivity at early&#8208;stage of cancerization. Here, an amplified sensing strategy is developed in the second near&#8208;infrared long&#8208;wavelength subregion (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L, 1500&#8211;1900&#160;nm) by integrating DNAzyme&#8208;triggered signal amplification technology and lanthanide&#8208;dye hybrid system. In the early&#8208;stage of CRC, the overexpressed biomarker microRNA&#8208;21 initiates the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;L luminescence ratiometric signal amplification of the CRCsensor. The high sensitivity with a limit of detection (LOD) of 1.26 pm allows non&#8208;invasive visualization of orthotopic colorectal cancerization via rectal administration, which achieves early and accurate in situ diagnosis at 2 weeks ahead of the in vitro histological results. This innovative approach offers a promising tool for early diagnosis and long&#8208;term monitoring of carcinogenesis progression, with potential applications in other cancer&#8208;related biomarkers.

         <title>Residual Al Adatoms Driven Epitaxy of AlGaN QWs for High&#8208;Performance UV LEDs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative strategy is proposed for the atomic&#8208;level controllable growth of composition&#8208;engineered AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) with residual Al adatom&#8208;assisted incorporation&#8208;enhanced epitaxy (RAIE) strategy, enabling the achievement of high&#8208;efficiency and long&#8208;lifetime ultraviolet light&#8208;emitting diodes (UV LEDs) with tunable wavelengths spanning the efficiency gap region from 276 to 329&#160;nm in the UV band.








Abstract
AlGaN&#8208;based ultraviolet (UV) light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) experience a notable reduction in efficiency within the 280&#8211;330&#160;nm wavelength range, known as the &#8220;UVB gap&#8221;. Given the extensive applications of UV LEDs in this wavelength range, it is imperative to bridge this efficiency gap. In this study, a strategy facilitated by the presence of residual Al adatoms is introduced to simultaneously improve the integration of Ga&#8208;adatoms and the migration of Al/Ga&#8208;adatoms during the growth of low&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum wells (QWs) even at high temperatures comparable to those used for high&#8208;Al&#8208;composition AlGaN quantum barriers. This growth strategy enables the epitaxy of high&#8208;quality AlGaN QWs with a wide tunable emission wavelength range across the UVB gap. Utilizing this approach, high&#8208;efficiency UV LEDs that effectively bridge the UVB gap are developed. Furthermore, benefiting from this QWs growth configuration, these UV LEDs exhibit an exceptionally long L70 lifetime, marking a significant step forward in the growth technology of AlGaN QWs and expanding the application possibilities of UV LEDs.

         <title>Engineering High&#8208;Density Grain Boundaries in Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox Solid&#8208;Solution Nanosheets for Efficient and Durable OER Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strategically engineered Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets with high&#8208;density grain boundaries exhibit enhanced oxygen evolution reaction performance in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers. This design optimizes Ru&#8208;Ir interactions and charge distribution, reducing overpotential to 189 mV for 10 mA cm&#8722;2 and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at industrial&#8208;scale current density. This advancement offers a pathway to efficient, cost&#8208;effective green hydrogen production.








Abstract
The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE) has long stood as a formidable challenge for green hydrogen sustainable production, hindered by sluggish kinetics, high overpotentials, and poor durability. Here, these barriers are transcended through a novel material design: strategic engineering of high&#8208;density grain boundaries within solid&#8208;solution Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox ultrathin nanosheets. These carefully tailored grain boundaries and synergistic Ir&#9472;Ru interactions, reduce the coordination of Ru atoms and optimize the distribution of charge, thereby enhancing both the catalytic activity and stability of the nanosheets, as verified by merely requiring an overpotential of 189 mV to achieve 10 mA cm&#8722;2 in acidic electrolyte. In situ electrochemical techniques, complemented by theoretical calculations, reveal that the OER follows an adsorption evolution mechanism, demonstrating the pivotal role of grain boundary engineering and electronic modulation in accelerating reaction kinetics. Most notably, the Ru0.8Ir0.2Ox exhibits outstanding industrial&#8208;scale performance in PEMWE, reaching 4.0 A cm&#8722;2 at 2 V and maintaining stability for &gt;1000 h at 500 mA cm&#8722;2. This efficiency reduces hydrogen production costs to $0.88 kg&#8722;1. This work marks a transformative step forward in designing efficient, durable OER catalysts, offering a promising pathway toward hydrogen production technologies and advancing the global transition to sustainable energy.

         <dc:description>
An n&#8208;doped ETL, that is c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI with high electrical conductivity, strong work function modification ability and good solvent resistance, is developed via a simple in situ cross&#8208;linking reaction. The tandem OPVs, with the all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL (m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS/c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI) achieve 20.06% efficiency under solar radiation, and 38.50% efficiency under 808 nm laser. This study provides a new method to design high&#8208;perfoimance ICLs.








Abstract
With merits of good solution processability, intrinsic flexibility, etc, organic/organic interconnecting layers (ICLs) are highly desirable for tandem organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Herein, an n&#8208;doped cross&#8208;linked organic electron transport layer (ETL), named c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI is developed, via a simple in situ quaternization reaction between bromopentyl&#8208;substituted naphthalene diimide derivative (NDI&#8208;Br) and polyethylenimine (PEI). Due to strong self&#8208;doping, c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI films exhibit a high electrical conductivity (0.06 S&#160;cm&#8722;1), which is important for efficient hole and electron reombination in ICL of tandem OPVs. In addition, the cross&#8208;linked ETLs show strong work function modulation ability, and good solvent&#8208;resistance. The above features enable c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI to function as an efficient ETL not only for single&#8208;junction OPVs, but also for tandem devices without any metal layer in ICL. Under solar radiation, the single&#8208;junction device with c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ETL achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.18%, surpassing the ZnO&#8208;based device (17.09%). The homo&#8208; and hetero&#8208;tandem devices with m&#8208;PEDOT:PSS:c&#8208;NDI&#8208;Br:PEI as ICL exhibit remarkable PCEs of 19.06% and 20.06%, respectively. Under 808&#160;nm laser radiation with a photon flux of 57&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, the homo&#8208;tandem device presents a superior PCE of 38.5%. This study provides a new ETL for constructing all&#8208;solution&#8208;processed organic/organic ICL, which can be integrated in flexible and wearable devices.

         <title>An Air&#8208;Operated, High&#8208;Performance Fe&#8208;Ion Secondary Battery Using Acidic Electrolyte</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The air&#8208;operated assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion batteries is realized by a very unexpected finding when excess acid is introduced into the traditional aqueous FeSO4 electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism for the as&#8208;detected ultra&#8208;low dissolved O2 and reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell is revealed.








Abstract
Fe2+ have emerged as the ideal charge carriers to construct aqueous batteries as one of the most competitive candidates for next&#8208;generation low&#8208;cost and safe energy storage. Unfortunately, the fast oxidation of Fe2+ into Fe3+ at ambient conditions inevitably requires the assembly process of the cells in an oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. Up to date, direct air assembly of aqueous Fe&#8208;ion battery remains very desirable yet highly challenge. Here oxidation of Fe2+ is found at ambient condition and is completely inhibited in an acidic electrolyte. A proton/O2 competitive mechanism in the acidic electrolyte is revealed with reduced coordinated O2 in the Fe2+ solvated shell for this unexpected finding. Based on this surprise, for the first time, air&#8208;operated assembly of iron&#8208;ion batteries is realized. Meanwhile, it is found that the acidic environment induces the in situ growth of active &#945;&#8208;FeOOH derivate on the VOPO4&#183;2H2O surface. Strikingly, the acidic electrolyte enables an air&#8208;operated Fe&#8208;ion battery with a high specific capacity of 192 mAh g&#8722;1 and ultrastable cycling stability over 1300 cycles at 0.1 A g&#8722;1. This work makes a break through on the air&#8208;assembly of Fe&#8208;ion battery without oxygen&#8208;free glovebox. It also reveals previously unknown proton/O2 competitive mechanisms in the Fe2+ solvated shell and cathode surface chemistry for aqueous Fe2+ storage.

         <title>Grains &gt; 2&#160;&#181;m with Regulating Grain Boundaries for Efficient Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite and All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective approach to grain boundary growth optimization: Incorporating a KTFB polyfluorinated additive into the antisolvent to regulate grain boundary growth, eliminate excessive halide lead and defects, and form wide&#8208;bandgap (1.78&#160;eV) perovskite films with grain size over 2&#160;&#181;m, enabling the realization of efficient two&#8208;terminal and four&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices.









Abstract
Tandem perovskite solar cells represent a significant avenue for the future development of perovskite photovoltaics. Despite their promise, wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites, essential for constructing efficient tandem structures, have encountered formidable challenges. Notably, the high bromine content (&gt;40%) in these 1.78 eV bandgap perovskites triggers rapid crystallization, complicating the control of grain boundary growth and leading to films with smaller grain sizes and higher defect density than those with narrower bandgaps. To address this, potassium tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate molecules are incorporated into the antisolvent, employing a crystallographic orientation&#8208;tailored strategy to optimize grain boundary growth, thereby achieving wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with grains exceeding 2&#160;&#181;m and effectively eliminating surplus lead halide and defects at the grain boundaries. As a result, remarkable efficiency is achieved in single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite devices, with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.7%, and in all&#8208;perovskite tandem devices, with a two&#8208;terminal PCE of 28.3% and a four&#8208;terminal PCE of 29.1%, which all rank among the highest reported values in the literature. Moreover, the stability of these devices has been markedly improved. These findings offer a novel perspective for driving further advancements in the perovskite solar cell domain.

         <title>Tailoring Self&#8208;Catalytic N&#9472;Co Bonds into Heterostructure Architectures: Deciphering Polytellurides Conversion Mechanism Toward Ultralong&#8208;Lifespan Potassium Ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
N&#8208;doped CoTe2 composites, incorporating 3D low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling structure, self&#8208;catalytic N&#9472;Co bonds, and heterojunction, have been successfully fabricated to accelerate the catalytic conversion of potassium polytellurides. Benefiting from the synergistic effects of unique architecture and superior conversion kinetics, the composites deliver an ultralong&#8208;lifespan potassium storage performance over 25&#160;000 cycles with an ultra&#8208;low capacity decay rate of only 0.0019%.








Abstract
Transition metal tellurides (TMTes) are promising anodes for potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) due to their high theoretical specific capacity and impressive electronic conductivity. Nevertheless, TMTes suffer from persistent capacity degradation due to the large volume expansion, high ion&#8208;diffusion energy barriers, and the dissolution/shuttle of potassium polytellurides (KxTey). Herein, a heterostructured CoTe2 composite equipped with a self&#8208;catalytic center (N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC) is developed, exploiting its low&#8208;tortuosity tunneling, chemical tunability, and self&#8208;catalytic properties to elevate cycling stability to new heights. Systematic experiments have verified that the elaborate N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC provides a short&#8208;range and efficient electron/ion transport path, accelerates K+ diffusion kinetics, and suppresses huge volume distortion. Notably, the N&#9472;Co bonds self&#8208;catalytic center can promote the adsorption capabilities and accelerate the conversion kinetics for KxTey under the synergistic effect of heterojunction. Consequently, the optimized N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC electrode delivers an ultralong&#8209;lifespan cyclability (over 25 000 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1, only 0.0019% capacity decay rate per cycle), outperforming those of reported Te&#8208;based anodes. Finally, the N&#8208;CoTe2/LTTC//PTCDA@450 full cell manifests impressive stability (over 4300 cycles at 2.0 A g&#8722;1). This work uncovers the impact of catalytic centers on the conversion of KxTey and provides valuable insights for rationally designing ultralong&#8208;lifespan TMTes anodes for PIBs.

         <title>Efficient and Super&#8208;Stable 990 Nm Light&#8209;Emitting Diodes Based on Quantum Cutting Emission of Trivalent Ytterbium in Pure&#8208;Br Quasi&#8209;2D Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>

This work proposed an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs)&#160;film and revealed the microscopic energy transfer process of the complex system. Moreover, an efficient and super&#8208;stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained. These findings will expand the optical properties and application potential of quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs materials.








Abstract
Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D&#8208;LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4fn inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb3+&#8208;doped PEA2Cs2Pb3Br10 quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb3+ ions in the quasi 2D&#8208;LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb3+ ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi&#8208;channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br&#8208;based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min.

Moreover, an efficient and super-stable 990 nm NIR PeLED with the external quantum efficiency (EQE)&#160;up to 8.8% and a record operational lifetime of 1274 min is obtained.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi 2D layered metal halide perovskites (2D-LMHPs) with natural quantum wells (QWs) structure have garnered significant attention due to their excellent optoelectronic properties. Doping rare earth (RE) ions with 4&lt;i&gt;f&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; inner shell emission levels can largely expand their optical and optoelectronic properties and realize diverse applications, but has not been reported yet. Herein, an efficient Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;-doped PEA&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; quasi 2D-LMHPs is fabricated and directly identified the Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in the quasi 2D-LMHPs at the atomic scale using aberration electron microscopy. The interaction between different n phases and Yb&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ions is elucidated using ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy and luminescent dynamics, which demonstrated efficient, different time scales and multi-channel energy transfer processes. Finally, through phase distribution manipulation and surface passivation, the optimized film exhibits a photoluminescence quantum yield of 144%. This is the first demonstration of quantum cutting emission in pure Br-based perovskite material, suppressing defect states and ion migration. The efficient and stable near-infrared light-emitting diodes (NIR LED) is fabricated with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 8.8% at 990&#160;nm and the record lifetime of 1274&#160;min. This work provides fresh insight into the interaction between RE ions and quasi 2D-LMHPs and extend the function and application of quasi 2D-LMHPs materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Pressure&#8208;Assisted Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p Hybridization within Targeted In&#8211;S Layer for Enhanced Photocatalytic Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layer modulation is instrumental in optimizing catalytic kinetics for obtaining highly active photocatalysts. A precise atomic layer regulation strategy is proposed to realize the individual modulation of the surface In&#8211;S layer in ZnIn2S4, which creates deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p to optimize H* adsorption/desorption and maximize surface catalytic benefits for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Solar&#8208;driven hydrogen production is significant for achieving carbon neutrality but is limited by unsatisfactory surface catalytic reaction kinetics. Layer regulation can impact carrier transmission or catalytic behavior, but the specific effects on the oxygen or hydrogen evolution reaction (OER or HER) remain unclear, and atomic layer level modulation for maxing HER is challenging. Here the distinct roles of modulated Zn&#8211;S or In&#8211;S surface layers in ZnIn2S4 (ZIS) for the OER and HER, respectively, are disentangled. Moreover, the extensive characterizations and computational results demonstrate that stressful environments enable individual modulation and introduce Ni into the surface In&#8211;S layer rather than the easily alterable Zn&#8211;S layer, creating deeper hybridized electronic states of Ni 3d&#8211;S 3p, optimizing H* adsorption/desorption, and maximizing surface catalytic benefits for the HER. Consequently, the optimized ZIS exhibited a photocatalytic hydrogen production rate of up to 18.19&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;32 times higher than pristine ZIS. This investigation expands the application scenarios of ultrasonic technology and inspires other precise control types, such as defects and crystal plane engineering, etc.

Abstract
Flexible bioelectronic interfaces with adhesive properties are essential for advancing modern medicine and human&#8208;machine interactions. However, achieving both stable adhesion and non&#8208;damaging detachment remains a significant challenge. In this study, a lithium bond&#8208;mediated molecular cascade hydrogel (LMCH) for bioelectronic interfaces is designed, which facilitates robust adhesion at the tissue level and permits atraumatic detachment for repositioning as required. By integrating the adhesive properties of the molecular cascade structure with the elastic characteristics of the hydrogel interface, the LMCH interface not only achieved a high adhesion strength (197&#160;J&#160;m&#8722;2) on the skin, but also significantly extended the cracking cycles on the tissue surface during the peeling process from 4 to 380, marking an enhancement of nearly two orders of magnitude. Furthermore, with Young's modulus similar to that of human tissue (25&#160;kPa), exceptional stretchability (1080%), and high ionic conductivity (7.14&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1), the LMCH interface demonstrates outstanding tissue compatibility, biocompatibility, and stable detection capabilities for electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) signals. This study presents new insights and potential for advancing bioelectronics and implantable interface technologies.

The peptide&#8208;oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids can be readily fabricated by the bioorthogonal click reaction between PEG5&#8208;P7&#8208;R9&#8208;(G&#8208;DOPA)4&#8208;HPGGPQ&#8208;H8&#8208;C&#8208;DBCO and miRNA&#8208;124&#8208;A5&#8208;(CH2)6&#8208;Azido, which achieve targeted delivery to the lesion sites, robust penetration through cell membrane, efficient scavenging of intracellular ROS, as well as timely escape from the endolysosomes of macrophages, inhibiting proinflammatory M1 polarization and osteoclast differentiation, eventually attenuating arthritic bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis.









Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a chronic autoimmune disease characterized by excessive inflammation, pathological bone resorption, and systemic osteoporosis. It lacks effective treatment due to the complex pathogenesis. Gene therapy, especially targeted oligonucleotide (ON) delivery therapy, offers a new prospect for the precise treatment of RA. Nevertheless, the clinical application of ON delivery therapy still faces various challenges such as the rapid enzymolysis by RNAse, the lack of tissue targeting ability, difficulty in cell membrane penetration, and the incapability of endolysosomal escape. To address these issues, a novel kind of engineered peptide and oligonucleotide (PON) nanohybrids are designed and fabricated, which provide various advantages including good biosafety, inflammatory region&#8208;targeted delivery, cell membrane penetration, reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging, and endolysosomal escape. The PON nanohybrids produce promising effects in suppressing inflammatory responses and osteoclastogenesis of macrophages via multiple signaling pathways. In vivo administration of PON nanohybrids not only ameliorates local joint bone destruction and systemic osteoporosis in the pathological state, but also demonstrates good prophylactic effects against the rapid progression of RA disease. In conclusion, the study presents a promising strategy for precise RA treatment and broadens the biomedical applications of gene therapy based on delivery system.

         <title>Resolving Dynamic Behavior of Electrocatalysts via Advances of Operando X&#8208;Ray Absorption Spectroscopies: Potential Artifacts and Practical Guidelines</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 18, May 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resolving dynamically fine structure of electrocatalysts is realized by advanced X&#8208;ray spectroscopies. Based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.








Abstract
Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real&#8208;time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high&#8208;brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X&#8208;ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X&#8208;ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X&#8208;ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X&#8208;ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon&#8208;flux density&#8208;, dose&#8208;, and time&#8208;dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X&#8208;ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X&#8208;ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.

Based on a case study of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X-ray irradiation are validated and it is identified whether the dynamic behaviors are electrochemical reaction related. A practical protocol is proposed for conducting reliable&#160;X-ray spectroscopic measurements for accurate spectra interpretation.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although numerous techniques are developed to enable real-time understanding of dynamic interactions at the solid&#8211;liquid interface during electrochemical reactions, further progress in the development of these methods over the last several decades has faced challenges. With the rapid development of high-brilliance synchrotron sources, operando X-ray spectroscopies have become increasingly popular for revealing interfacial features and catalytic mechanisms in electrocatalysis. Nevertheless, the resulting spectra are highly sensitive to factors such as X-ray radiation, reaction environment, and acquisition procedures, all of which may potentially introduce artifacts that are often overlooked, leading to misinterpretations of electrocatalytic behaviors. In this perspective, several emerging hard X-ray spectroscopies used in electrocatalysis research are reviewed, highlighting their electronic transition processes, detection modes, and functional complementarity. Significantly, based on a case study of operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy at various beamlines, potential artifacts generated by X-ray irradiation are systematically investigated through photon-flux density-, dose-, and time-dependent studies of typical copper electrocatalysts. Accordingly, a practical protocol for conducting reliable X-ray spectroscopic measurements in operando electrocatalytic studies to minimize potential artifacts that can affect the resulting X-ray spectra, thereby ensuring accurate interpretation and a deeper understanding of interfacial interactions and electrocatalytic mechanisms, is established.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>
