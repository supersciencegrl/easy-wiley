         <title>An All&#8208;Printed, Fast&#8208;Response Flexible Humidity Sensor Based on Hexagonal&#8208;WO3 Nanowires for Multifunctional Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Screen&#8208;printed flexible humidity sensors based on hexagonal tungsten oxide nanowires exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, and fast response in a wide relative humidity range, showing great potential in respiration rate monitoring, medicine packaging state monitoring, and non&#8208;contact measurements. Moreover, the sensitivity of the humidity sensors can be adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode.








Abstract
The utilization of printing techniques for the development of high&#8208;performance humidity sensors holds immense significance for various applications in the fields of the Internet of Things, agriculture, human healthcare, and storage environments. However, the long response time and low sensitivity of current printed humidity sensors limit their practical applications. Herein, a series of high&#8208;sensing&#8208;performance flexible resistive&#8208;type humidity sensors is fabricated by the screen&#8208;printing method, and hexagonal tungsten oxide (h&#8208;WO3) is employed as the humidity&#8208;sensing material due to its low cost, strong chemical adsorption ability, and excellent humidity&#8208;sensing ability. The as&#8208;prepared printed sensors exhibit high sensitivity, good repeatability, outstanding flexibility, low hysteresis, and fast response (1.5&#160;s) in a wide relative humidity (RH) range (11&#8211;95%&#160;RH). Furthermore, the sensitivity of humidity sensors can be easily adjusted by altering the manufacturing parameters of the sensing layer and interdigital electrode to meet the diverse requirements of specific applications. The printed flexible humidity sensors possess immense potential in various applications, including wearable devices, non&#8208;contact measurements, and packaging opening state monitoring.

         <title>High&#8208;stroke, High&#8208;Output&#8208;Force, Fabric&#8208;Lattice Artificial Muscles for Soft Robots</title>

Abstract
Artificial muscles, providing safe and close interaction between humans and machines, are essential in soft robotics. However, their insufficient deformation, output force, or configurability usually limits their applications. Herein, we present a class of lightweight fabric&#8208;lattice artificial muscles (FAMs) that are pneumatically actuated with large contraction ratios (up to 87.5%) and considerable output forces (up to a load of 20&#160;kg, force&#8208;to&#8208;weight ratio of over 250). Our developed FAMs consist of a group of active air chambers that are zigzag connected into a lattice through passive connecting layers. The geometry of these fabric components is programmable to convert the in&#8208;plane lattice of FAMs into out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configurations (e.g., arched and cylindrical) capable of linear/radial contraction. We further demonstrate that our FAMs can be configured for various soft robotic applications, including the powerful robotic elbow with large motion range and high load capability, the well&#8208;fitting assistive shoulder exosuit that can reduce muscle activity during abduction, and the adaptive soft gripper that can grasp irregular objects. These results show the unique features and broad potential of our FAMs for high&#8208;performance soft robots.

         <title>Bacteria&#8208;based Backpacks to Enhance Adoptive Macrophage Transfer against Solid Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Adoptive cell therapy has emerged as a promising approach for cancer treatment. However, the transfer of macrophages exhibits limited efficacy against solid tumors due to the dynamic cellular phenotypic shift from anti&#8208;tumor to pro&#8208;tumor states within the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, a strategy of attaching bacteria to macrophages (M&#248;@bac) is reported that endows adoptively infused macrophages with durable stimulation by leveraging the intrinsic immunogenicity of bacteria. These attached bacteria, referred to as backpacks, are encapsulated with adhesive nanocoatings and can sustainably control the cellular phenotypes in vivo. Moreover, M&#248;@bac could repolarize endogenous tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs), leading to a more robust immune response and thus reducing the tumor progression in a murine 4T1 cancer model without any side effects. This study utilizing bacteria as cellular backpacks opens a new avenue for the development of cell therapies.

         <title>Realizing Unassisted Photo&#8208;charging of Zinc&#8208;Air Batteries by Anisotropic Charge Separation in Photoelectrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Solar rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8208;air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we achieved unassisted photo&#8208;charging of a zinc&#8208;air battery by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn2S4, TiO2 and In2O3), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn2S4 photoelectrode was revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities. The charge separation is facet&#8208;dependent, which was observed using Kelvin probe force microscopy, verifying a cause&#8208;and&#8208;effect relationship between the photo&#8208;charge accumulation on photoelectrodes and their photo&#8208;charging performance in zinc&#8208;air batteries. This work achieves an unassisted photo&#8208;charging current density of 1.9&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with a light&#8208;to&#8208;chemical energy conversion efficiency of 1.45%, highlighting the importance of anisotropic semiconductors for unassisted photo&#8208;charging of zinc&#8208;air batteries via efficient photogenerated charge separation.

&lt;p&gt;Solar rechargeable zinc-air battery is a promising approach for capturing and storing intermittent solar energy through photoelectrochemical reactions. However, unassisted photo-charging of zinc-air batteries is challenging due to suboptimal carrier accumulation on photoelectrodes, resulting in sluggish reaction kinetics. Here, we achieved unassisted photo-charging of a zinc-air battery by investigating anisotropic photogenerated charge separation on a series of representative semiconductors (ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), among which the exceptional anisotropic charge separation on a ZnIn&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; photoelectrode was revealed based on anisotropic charge diffusion capabilities.

         <title>Breaking The Permeance&#8208;Selectivity Tradeoff for Post&#8208;Combustion Carbon Capture: A Bio&#8208;Inspired Strategy to Form Ultrathin Hollow Fiber Membranes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Thin film composite (TFC) hollow fiber membranes with ultrathin selective layer are desirable to maximize the gas permeance for practical applications. Herein we propose a bio&#8208;inspired strategy to fabricate sub&#8208;100&#8208;nm membranes via a tree&#8208;mimicking polymer network, term as PDMS&#8208;PEG, with amphipathic components featuring multi&#8208;functionalities. The hydrophobic polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) brushes act as the roots that can strongly cling to the gutter layer, the PDMS crosslinkers function as the xylems to enable fast gas transport, and the hydrophilic ethylene&#8208;oxide moieties (brushes and mobile molecules) resemble tree leaves that selectively attract CO2 molecules. As a result, a &#8764; 27&#160;nm&#8208;thick PDMS&#8208;PEG selective layer can be attached onto the hollow fiber supported PDMS gutter layer through simple dip&#8208;coating method without any modification. Furthermore, a CO2 permeance of &#8764; 2700 GPU and a CO2/N2 selectivity of &#8764; 21 that is beyond the permeance&#8208;selectivity upper bound for hollow fiber membranes is achieved. Our bio&#8208;inspired concept can potentially open the possibility of scalable hollow fiber membranes production for commercial applications in post&#8208;combustion carbon capture and beyond.

Nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) have immense potential for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;definition displays and lighting applications. They offer numerous advantages, such as low cost, high luminous efficiency, narrow emission, and long lifetime. However, the external quantum efficiency (EQE) of Nc&#8208;LEDs, typically employing isotropic nanocrystals, has been limited by the out&#8208;coupling factor. Here we demonstrate efficient, bright, and long lifetime red Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs). Through modification of the substrate's surface properties and control of the interactions among CQWs, we successfully spin&#8208;coated a self&#8208;assembled layer with an exceptionally high distribution of in&#8208;plane transitions dipole moment (TDM) of 95%, resulting in an out&#8208;coupling factor of 37%. Our devices exhibit a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 26.9%, accompanied by a maximum brightness of 55,754&#160;cd m&#8722;2 and a long operational lifetime (T95@100&#160;cd m&#8722;2) over 15,000&#160;h. These achievements represent a significant advancement compared to previous studies on Nc&#8208;LEDs incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. We expect our work to provide a general self&#8208;assembly strategy for enhancing the light extraction efficiency of Nc&#8208;LEDs based on anisotropic nanocrystals.

Abstract
Stable solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is the key to improve the electrochemical performance of lithium metal batteries. However, there are still many puzzles about SEI film that have not been well explained, due to the complexity of electrochemical reactions involving in SEI formation and the absence of direct observation methods for SEI. Here we realize the direct observation of SEI by skillfully designed fluorescent tracers acting as an SEI film&#8208;forming additive for electrolytes. These fluorescent tracers have three important moieties: an olefin group for polymerization on anode surface so as to participate in SEI film formation during charge/discharge cycles, a polar group for Li&#8208;ion conduction, and an AIEgen for fluorescent tracing. Therefore, the tracers participate in SEI film&#8208;forming and result in a shining SEI film. This shining SEI film with intrinsic fluorescence signal allows direct observation and quantification on the distribution, relative abundance, and macro morphology of SEI. These fluorescent tracers can also reveal the SEI formation&#8208;growth&#8208;destruction regularity during charge/discharge cycles. Several summarized typical macro morphologies and evolution stages of SEI would enrich our knowledge and understanding of SEI, and help us to gain insight into the interaction between electrolyte and anode, electrochemical performance and cycle life of batteries.

         <title>Valence Oscillation of Ru Active Sites for Efficient and Robust Acidic Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The continuous oxidation and leachability of active sites in Ru&#8208;based catalysts hinder practical application in proton&#8208;exchange membrane water electrolyzers (PEMWE). Herein, robust inter&#8208;doped tungsten&#8208;ruthenium oxide heterostructures [(Ru&#8208;W)Ox] fabricated by sequential rapid oxidation and metal thermomigration processes are proposed to enhance the activity and stability of acidic oxygen evolution reaction (OER). The introduction of high&#8208;valent W species induces the valence oscillation of the Ru sites during OER, facilitating the cyclic transition of the active metal oxidation states and maintaining the continuous operation of the active sites. The preferential oxidation of W species and electronic gain of Ru sites in the inter&#8208;doped heterostructure significantly stabilize RuOx on WOx substrates beyond the Pourbaix stability limit of bare RuO2. Furthermore, the asymmetric Ru&#8208;O&#8208;W active units are generated around the heterostructure interface to adsorb the oxygen intermediates synergistically, enhancing the intrinsic OER activity. Consequently, the inter&#8208;doped (Ru&#8208;W)Ox heterostructures not only demonstrate an overpotential of 170&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and excellent stability of 300&#160;h in acidic electrolytes but also exhibit the potential for practical applications, as evidenced by the stable operation at 0.5 A cm&#8722;2 for 300&#160;h in PEMWE.

         <title>Dual Functional MXene&#8208;Based Bioanode for Wearable Self&#8208;Charging Biosupercapacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
As a reliable energy&#8208;supply platform for wearable electronics, biosupercapacitors combine the characteristics of biofuel cells and supercapacitors to harvest and store the energy from human's sweat. However, the bulky preparation process and deep embedding of enzyme active sites in bioelectrodes usually limit the energy harvesting process, retarding the practical power&#8208;supply sceneries especially during the complicated in&#8208;vivo motion. Herein, we design the MXene/single&#8208;walled carbon nanotube/lactate oxidase hierarchical structure as the dual&#8208;functional bioanode, which can not only provide the superior three&#8208;dimensional catalytic microenvironment for enzyme accommodation to harvest energy from sweat, but also offer the sufficient capacitance to store energy via the electrical double&#8208;layer capacitor. The wearable biosupercapacitor is fabricated to &#8220;island&#8208;bridge&#8221; structure with the composite bioanode, active carbon/Pt cathode, polyacrylamide hydrogel substrate and liquid metal conductor. In vivo test, the device exhibits an open circuit voltage of 0.48&#160;V and the high power density of 220.9 &#956;W cm&#8722;2 at 0.5&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. The compact conformal adhesion with skin is successfully maintained under stretching/bending conditions. After repeatedly stretching the devices, there is no significant power attenuation in pulsed output. The unique bioelectrode structure and attractive energy harvesting/storing properties demonstrate the promising potential of this biosupercapacitor as micro self&#8208;powered platform of wearable electronics.

         <title>MOFs for Ultrahigh Efficiency Pulsed Laser Micropropulsion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Conventional propellant materials, such as polymers and single metal elements, have long been investigated for their potential in pulsed laser micropropulsion (LMP) technology. However, achieving superior LMP efficiency through physical mixing of these materials remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present a paradigm shift by introducing porous crystalline polymers, known as Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks (MOFs), as novel propellants in pulsed LMP. MOFs are composed of metal cations and organic ligands that form ordered structures through coordination, eliminating the problem of local hot zones arising from uneven physical mixing encountered in LMP. In direct comparison to conventional polymers and single element targets, MOFs exhibit substantially higher LMP efficiency. By precisely tailoring the metal atom fraction within MOFs, an extraordinary ultrahigh efficiency of 51.15% is achieved in pulsed LMP, surpassing the performance of similar materials previously reported in the literature. This pioneering application of MOFs not only revolutionizes the field of laser micropropulsion but also opens up new frontiers for MOF utilization in various energy applications.

         <title>High&#8208;efficiency Area&#8208;Emissive White Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Transistor for Full&#8208;Color Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The construction of high&#8208;performance white organic light&#8208;emitting transistor (OLET) with uniform area emission is crucial for smart display technologies, but remains great challenging. Herein, we demonstrate high&#8208;efficiency uniform area&#8208;emissive OLETs based on a unique lateral&#8208;integrated device configuration which incorporates efficient energy transfer of phosphorescent and fluorescent guests, enabling color&#8208;tunable and white emission. Through precisely regulating the energy transfer between host and guests, high external quantum efficiency of 13.9% for white&#8208;emission OLETs is achieved due to the improved high exciton utilization and light outcoupling efficiency, and prevented exciton&#8208;charge annihilation and electrode photon losses, which is the highest value reported so far for OLETs. Moreover, good loop stability is also achieved, along with effective gate tunability and ultralow driving voltage of below 5&#160;V. Finally, a 4 &#215; 6 white&#8208;emission OLET array for full&#8208;color display is demonstrated for the first time, suggesting its great potential applications for advanced display technologies.

         <title>Intrafibrillar Crosslinking Enables Decoupling of Mechanical Properties and Structure of a Composite Fibrous Hydrogel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The fibrous network of an extracellular matrix (ECM) possesses mechanical properties that convey critical biological functions in cell mechanotransduction. Engineered fibrous hydrogels show promise in emulating key aspects of ECM structure and functions, however, varying hydrogel mechanics without changing its architecture remains a challenge. &#160;We developed a composite fibrous hydrogel to vary gel stiffness without affecting structure by controlling intrafibrillar crosslinking. The hydrogel was formed from aldehyde&#8208;modified cellulose nanocrystals and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) that provided the capability of intrafibrillar photocrosslinking. By varying the degree of gelatin functionalization with methacryloyl groups and/or photoirradiation time, &#160;we changed the hydrogel's elastic modulus by more than an order of magnitude, while preserving the fiber diameter and pore size. The hydrogel was used to seed primary mouse lung fibroblasts and test the role of ECM stiffness on fibroblast contraction and activation. Increasing hydrogel stiffness by stronger intrafibrillar crosslinking resulted in enhanced fibroblast activation and increased fibroblast contraction force, yet at reduced contraction speed. The developed approach enables the fabrication of biomimetic hydrogels with decoupled structural and mechanical properties, facilitating studies of the influence of tissue&#8208;like ECM mechanics on tissue development and disease progression.

         <title>Highly Stable and Efficient Formamidinium&#8208;Based 2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cell via Lattice Manipulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Formamidinium&#8208;based (FA) 2D perovskites have emerged as highly promising candidates in solar cells. However, the insertion of 2D spacer cations into the perovskite lattice concomitantly introduces micro&#8208;strain and unfavorable orientations that hinder efficiency and stability. In this study, by finely tuning the FA&#8208;based 2D perovskite lattice through spacer cation engineering, we achieved a stable lattice structure with balanced distortion, micro&#8208;strain relaxation, and reduced carrier&#8208;lattice interactions. These advancements effectively stabilize the inherently soft lattice against light and thermal aging stress, particularly extreme temperature changes. To reduce the photocurrent loss induced by undesired crystal texture, we further employed a polarity&#8208;matched molecular&#8208;type selenourea (SENA) additive to modulate the crystallization kinetics. The introduction of the SENA significantly inhibits the disordered crystallization induced by spacer cations and drives the templated growth of the quantum well structure with a vertical orientation. This controlled crystallization process effectively reduces crystal defects and enhances charge separation. Ultimately, the optimized FA&#8208;based perovskite photovoltaic devices achieved a remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.03% (certified steady&#8208;state efficiency of 19.30%), setting a new record for low&#8208;n 2D perovskite solar cells. Furthermore, the devices exhibited less than 1% efficiency degradation after operating at maximum power point for 1000 hours and maintained 92.3% and 91.1% of the initial efficiency after aging at 85&#176;C for 720 hours and 50 cycles of cold&#8208;warm shock, respectively.

         <title>A Bioinspired Injectable, Adhesive, and Self&#8208;Healing Hydrogel with Dual Hybrid Network for Neural Regeneration after Spinal Cord Injury</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel with a double&#8208;network architecture is created from dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer self&#8208;assembly peptide. Its strong tissue adhesion facilitates excellent integration in the host and demonstrates self&#8208;healing feature. The novel hydrogel demonstrates a strong capability of promoting exuberant neural regeneration after spinal cord injury and consequently promotes sensory and motor functions, particularly protecting the urinary system.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based regenerated scaffolds show promise as a platform for neural regeneration following spinal cord injury (SCI). Nevertheless, the persistent problem of poor mechanical strength and limited integration with the host tissue still exists. In this study, a bioinspired hydrogel with highly sophisticated features for neural regeneration after SCI is developed. The hydrogel is composed of dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA)&#8208;grafted chitosan and a designer peptide, offering a unique set of qualities such as being injectable, having self&#8208;healing abilities, and adhering to tissues. Compared to conventional hydrogels, this hydrogel ensures a significant promotion of immune response modulation and axon regrowth while featuring synapse formation of various neurotransmitters and myelin regeneration. Subsequently, functional recoveries are enhanced, including motor function, sensory function, and particularly bladder defect repair. These positive findings demonstrate that the hydrogel has great potential as a strategy for repairing SCI. Moreover, the versatility of this strategy goes beyond neural regeneration and holds promise for tissue regeneration in other contexts. Overall, this proposed hydrogel represents an innovative and multifaceted tool for engineering structures in the biomedical field.

         <title>Phosphine&#8208;Oxide&#8208;Balanced Intra&#8208; and Interchain Through&#8208;Space Charge Transfer in Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Polymers: Beyond 30% External Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer&#8208;featured non&#8208;conjugated polymers with largely enhanced thermally activated delayed fluorescence performance are demonstrated, in which a secondary phosphine oxide acceptor is introduced to balance intra&#8208; and interchain charge transfer for radiation facilitation and non&#8208;radiation suppression, resulting in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 30%, respectively.








Abstract
Through&#8208;space charge transfer (TSCT) is crucial for developing highly efficient thermally activated delayed fluorescence polymers. The balance of intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT can markedly improve performance, but it is still a big challenge. In this work, an effective strategy for &#8220;intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT balance&#8221; is demonstrated by way of a series of non&#8208;conjugated copolymers containing a 9,9&#8208;dimethylacridine donor and triazine&#8208;phosphine oxide (PO)&#8208;based acceptors. Steady&#8208;state and transient emission spectra indicate that compared to the corresponding blends, the copolymers can indeed achieve balanced intra&#8208; and interchain TSCT by accurately optimizing the inductive and steric effects of the acceptors. The DPOT acceptor with the strongest electron&#8208;withdrawing ability and the second bigger steric hindrance endows its copolymers with state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art photoluminescence and electroluminescence quantum efficiencies beyond 95% and 32%, respectively. This demonstrates that, compared to other congeners, the synergistic inductive and steric effects effectively enhance TSCT in DPOT&#8208;based copolymers for radiation, and suppress singlet and triplet quenching. The record&#8208;high efficiencies of its devices make this kind of copolymers hold the potential for low&#8208;cost, large&#8208;scale, and high&#8208;efficiency applications.

         <title>Photothermal&#8211;Magnetic Synergistic Effects in an Electrocatalyst for Efficient Water Splitting under Optical&#8211;Magnetic Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Benefiting from the corresponding optical and magnetic design of Co3O4/CoFe2O4@NF, its resistance is reduced from 16 &#937; to 7&#160;&#937; under an optical&#8211;magnetic field (AM 1.5G, 100&#160;mT). Furthermore, spin polarization occurs inducing the parallel alignment of oxygen atoms and the formation of paramagnetic triplet oxygen, reducing the reaction energy barrier, and improving the kinetics of the OER reaction. The overpotential required to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in the optical&#8211;magnetic field is only 172.4&#160;mV, achieving a &#916;&#951; of 76.51&#160;mV.








Abstract
The slow oxygen evolution reaction (OER) limits water splitting, and external fields can help improve it. However, the effect of a single external field on the OER is limited and unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the mechanism by which external fields improve the OER is unclear, particularly in the presence of multiple fields. Herein, a strategy is proposed for enhancing the OER activity of a catalyst using the combined effect of an optical&#8211;magnetic field, and the mechanism of catalytic activity enhancement is studied. Under the optical&#8211;magnetic field, Co3O4 reduces the resistance by increasing the catalyst temperature. Meanwhile, CoFe2O4 further reduces the resistance via the negative magnetoresistance effect, thus decreasing the resistance from 16 to 7.0&#160;&#937;. Additionally, CoFe2O4 acts as a spin polarizer, and electron polarization results in a parallel arrangement of oxygen atoms, which increases the kinetics of the OER under the magnetic field. Benefiting from the optical and magnetic response design, Co3O4/CoFe2O4@Ni foam requires an overpotential of 172.4&#160;mV to reach a current density of 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 under an optical&#8211;magnetic field, which is significantly higher than those of recently reported state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>High&#8208;Density Integration of Ultrabright OLEDs on a Miniaturized Needle&#8208;Shaped CMOS Backplane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;brightness organic LED arrays are produced by direct vacuum deposition of the organic materials onto complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) backplanes produced in a commercial chip foundry. The composition of the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum anodes is analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy and their surface is pre&#8208;conditioned for optimal electrical contact by plasma treatment.








Abstract
Direct deposition of organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) on silicon&#8208;based complementary metal&#8211;oxide&#8211;semiconductor (CMOS) chips has enabled self&#8208;emissive microdisplays with high resolution and fill&#8208;factor. Emerging applications of OLEDs in augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) displays and in biomedical applications, e.g., as brain implants for cell&#8208;specific light delivery in optogenetics, require light intensities orders of magnitude above those found in traditional displays. Further requirements often include a microscopic device footprint, a specific shape and ultrastable passivation, e.g., to ensure biocompatibility and minimal invasiveness of OLED&#8208;based implants. In this work, up to 1024 ultrabright, microscopic OLEDs are deposited directly on needle&#8208;shaped CMOS chips. Transmission electron microscopy and energy&#8208;dispersive X&#8208;ray spectroscopy are performed on the foundry&#8208;provided aluminum contact pads of the CMOS chips to guide a systematic optimization of the contacts. Plasma treatment and implementation of silver interlayers lead to ohmic contact conditions and thus facilitate direct vacuum deposition of orange&#8208; and blue&#8208;emitting OLED stacks leading to micrometer&#8208;sized pixels on the chips. The electronics in each needle allow each pixel to switch individually. The OLED pixels generate a mean optical power density of 0.25&#160;mW&#160;mm&#8722;2, corresponding to &gt;40&#160;000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, well above the requirement for daylight AR applications and optogenetic single&#8208;unit activation in the brain.

         <title>Exploring the Synergies of Single&#8208;Molecule Fluorescence and 2D Materials Coupled by DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Integrating single&#8208;molecule (SM) fluorescence methods with 2D materials by using DNA and related nanostructures as molecular anchors provides significant benefits for both fields: deepening knowledge about the materials while adding information to SM fluorescence experiments. This Perspective delves into the rich interplay, highlights new opportunities for further synergies, and identifies challenges in this cross&#8208;disciplinary venture.








Abstract
The world of 2D materials is steadily growing, with numerous researchers attempting to discover, elucidate, and exploit their properties. Approaches relying on the detection of single fluorescent molecules offer a set of advantages, for instance, high sensitivity and specificity, that allow the drawing of conclusions with unprecedented precision. Herein, it is argued how the study of 2D materials benefits from fluorescence&#8208;based single&#8208;molecule modalities, and vice versa. A special focus is placed on DNA, serving as a versatile adaptor when anchoring single dye molecules to 2D materials. The existing literature on the fruitful combination of the two fields is reviewed, and an outlook on the additional synergies that can be created between them provided.

         <title>In Situ Engineering of Inorganic&#8208;Rich Solid Electrolyte Interphases via Anion Choice Enables Stable, Lithium Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The discovery of liquid battery electrolytes that facilitate the formation of stable solid electrolyte interphases (SEIs) to mitigate dendrite formation is imperative to enable lithium anodes in next&#8208;generation energy&#8208;dense batteries. Compared to traditional electrolyte solvents, tetrahydrofuran (THF)&#8208;based electrolyte systems have demonstrated great success in enabling high&#8208;stability lithium anodes by encouraging the decomposition of anions (instead of organic solvent) and thus generating inorganic&#8208;rich SEIs. Herein, by employing a variety of different lithium salts (i.e., LiPF6, LiTFSI, LiFSI, and LiDFOB),&#160;we&#160;demonstrate that electrolyte anions modulate the inorganic composition and resulting properties of the SEI. Through novel analytical ToF&#8208;SIMS methods, such as hierarchical clustering of depth profiles and compositional analysis using integrated yields,&#160;we&#160;examine the chemical composition and morphology of the SEIs generated from each electrolyte system. Notably, the LiDFOB electrolyte provides an exceptionally stable system to enable lithium anodes, delivering &gt; 1500 cycles at a current density of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity of 0.5 mAh g&#8722;1 in symmetrical cells. Furthermore, Li//LFP cells using this electrolyte demonstrate high&#8208;rate, reversible lithium storage, supplying 139 mAh g(LFP)&#8722;1 at C/2 (&#8764; 0.991 mAh cm&#8722;2, @ 0.61 mA cm&#8722;2) with 87.5% capacity retention over 300 cycles (average Coulombic efficiency &gt;99.86%).

         <title>Cation&#8208;Disorder Engineering Promotes Efficient Charge&#8208;Carrier Transport in AgBiS2 Nanocrystal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Efficient charge&#8208;carrier transport is critical to the success of emergent semiconductors in photovoltaic applications. So far, disorder has been considered detrimental for charge&#8208;carrier transport, lowering mobilities and causing fast recombination. This work demonstrates that, when properly engineered, cation disorder in a multinary chalcogenide semiconductor can considerably enhance the charge&#8208;carrier mobility and extend the charge&#8208;carrier lifetime. Here, the properties of AgBiS2 nanocrystals (NCs) are explored where Ag and Bi cation&#8208;ordering can be modified via thermal&#8208;annealing. Local Ag&#8208;rich and Bi&#8208;rich domains formed during hot&#8208;injection synthesis are transformed to induce homogeneous disorder (random Ag&#8208;Bi distribution). Such cation engineering results in a six&#8208;fold increase in the charge&#8208;carrier mobility, reaching &#8764;2.7&#8201;cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 in AgBiS2 NC thin films. It is further demonstrated that homogeneous cation disorder reduces charge&#8208;carrier localisation, a hallmark of charge&#8208;carrier transport recently observed in silver&#8208;bismuth semiconductors. This work proposes that cation&#8208;disorder engineering flattens the disordered electronic landscape, removing tail states that would otherwise exacerbate Anderson localisation of small polaronic states. Together, these findings unravel how cation&#8208;disorder engineering in multinary semiconductors can enhance the efficiency of renewable energy applications.

         <title>Nonflammable Polyfluorides&#8208;Anchored Quasi&#8208;Solid Electrolytes for Ultra&#8208;Safe Anode&#8208;Free Lithium Pouch Cells Without Thermal Runaway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The safe operation of rechargeable batteries is crucial because of numerous instances of fire and explosion mishaps. However, battery chemistry involving metallic lithium (Li) as the anode is prone to thermal runaway in flammable organic electrolytes under abusive conditions. Herein, an in&#8208;situ encapsulation strategy is proposed to construct nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid electrolytes through the radical polymerization of a hexafluorobutyl acrylate (HFBA) monomer and a pentaerythritol tetraacrylate (PETEA) crosslinker. The quasi&#8208;solid system eliminated the inherent flammability of ether electrolytes with zero self&#8208;extinguishing time owing to the radical capturing ability of HFBA in the gas phase. Additionally, the graphitized carbon layer generated during the decomposition of PETEA at high temperatures obstructs the heat and oxygen required for combustion. When coupled with Au&#8208;modified reduced graphene oxide anodic current collectors and lithium sulfide cathodes, the assembled anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal cell based on the QSE exhibited no signs of cell expansion or gas generation during cycling, and thermal runaway was eliminated under multiple mechanical, electrical, and thermal abuse scenarios and even rigorous strikes. This nonflammable quasi&#8208;solid configuration with gas&#8208; and condensed&#8208;phase flame&#8208;retardant mechanisms can drive a technological leap in anode&#8208;free Li&#8208;metal pouch cells and secure the practical applications necessary to power our society in a safe manner.

This nonflammable quasi-solid configuration with gas- and condensed-phase flame-retardant mechanisms can drive a technological leap in anode-free Li-metal pouch cells and secure the practical applications necessary to power our society in a safe manner.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid Nanoparticles for Nanocatalytic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Nanotechnology is revolutionizing cancer therapy, and catalyzes the emerging of ion&#8208;involved cancer&#8208;therapeutic modality, which unfortunately suffers from undesirable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular ion delivery. To radically extricate from this critical issue, the glutathione (GSH)&#8208;responsive organosilica network was employed to lock the liquid drops at the nanoscale via a general bottom&#8208;up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221;. In this work, a sulfate radical generation donor (Na2S2O8), as a paradigm &#8220;ion drug&#8221;, was entrapped into this liquid nanoparticle for efficiently delivering to the tumor region. After further surface engineering with pH&#8208;responsive tannic acid&#8208;Fe2+ framework, these liquid nanoparticles achieved tumor&#8208;microenvironmental pH/GSH&#8208;dual responsive ion release (Fe2+/Na+/S2O82&#8722;) after reaching the tumor sites, where the Fe2+ further triggered S2O82&#8722; to generate toxic &#8226;SO4&#8722; and &#8226;OH, effectively executing cancer cell ferroptosis (Fe2+, ROS) and pyroptosis (Na+, ROS). Such a tumor&#8208;responsive/specific liquid nanoplatform is highly instructive for further ion&#8208;mediated nanomedicine and disease treatment.

&lt;p&gt;Nanotechnology is revolutionizing cancer therapy, and catalyzes the emerging of ion-involved cancer-therapeutic modality, which unfortunately suffers from undesirable nanocarriers for efficient intracellular ion delivery. To radically extricate from this critical issue, the glutathione (GSH)-responsive organosilica network was employed to lock the liquid drops at the nanoscale via a general bottom-up strategy to achieve the systemic delivery of &#8220;ion drugs&#8221;. In this work, a sulfate radical generation donor (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;), as a paradigm &#8220;ion drug&#8221;, was entrapped into this liquid nanoparticle for efficiently delivering to the tumor region.

         <title>Water&#8208;resistant Subwavelength Perovskite Lasing from Transparent Silica&#8208;Based Nanocavity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Great research efforts have been devoted to exploring the miniaturization of chip&#8208;scale coherent light sources possessing excellent lasing performance. Despite the indispensable&#160;role in Si photonics, SiO2 is generally considered not contributing to the starting up and operation of integrated lasers. Here we demonstrate an extraordinary&#8208;performance subwavelength&#8208;scale perovskite vertical cavity laser with all&#8208;transparent SiO2 cavity, whose cavity is ultra&#8208;simple and composed of only two parallel SiO2 plates. By introducing a ligand&#8208;assisted thermally co&#8208;evaporation strategy, highly luminescent perovskite film with high reproducibility and excellent optical gain is grown directly on SiO2. Benefitting from their high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index contrast, low&#8208;threshold, high&#8208;quality factor, and single&#8208;mode lasing is achieved in subwavelength range of &#8764;120&#160;nm, and verified by long&#8208;range coherence distance (115.6&#160;&#956;m) and high linear polarization degree (82%). More importantly, the subwavelength perovskite laser device could operate in water for 20 days without any observable degradation, exhibiting ultra&#8208;stable water&#8208;resistant performance. Our findings would provide a simple but robust and reliable strategy for the miniaturized on&#8208;chip lasers compatible with Si photonics.

         <title>How reproducible is the synthesis of Zr&#8211;porphyrin metal&#8211;organic frameworks? An interlaboratory study</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are a rapidly growing class of materials that offer great promise in various applications. However, the synthesis remains challenging: for example, a range of crystal structures can often be accessed from the same building blocks, which complicates the phase selectivity. Likewise, the high sensitivity to slight changes in synthesis conditions may cause reproducibility issues. This is crucial, as it hampers the research and commercialisation of affected MOFs. Here, we&#160;present the first&#8208;ever interlaboratory study of the synthetic reproducibility of two Zr&#8211;porphyrin MOFs, PCN&#8208;222 and PCN&#8208;224, to investigate the scope of this problem. For PCN&#8208;222, only one sample out of ten was&#160;phase pure and of the correct symmetry, while for PCN&#8208;224, three were&#160;phase pure, although none of these show the spatial linker order characteristic of PCN&#8208;224. Instead, these samples resemble dPCN&#8208;224 (disordered PCN&#8208;224), which was&#160;recently reported by us. The variability in thermal behavior, defect content, and BET surface area of the synthesised samples are also studied. Our&#160;results have important ramifications for field of metal&#8211;organic frameworks and their crystallisation, by highlighting the synthetic challenges associated with a multi&#8208;variable synthesis space and flat energy landscapes characteristic of&#160;MOFs.

         <title>Stabilizing precursor solution and controlling crystallization kinetics simultaneously for high&#8208;performance perovskite solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The efficiency of metal halide perovskite solar cells has skyrocketed, however defects created by aging precursor solutions and during crystallization pose a significant barrier to reproducibility and efficiency of solar cells. Herein, we report an additive method using Fluoro&#8208;N,N,N&#8243;,N&#8243;&#8208;tetramethylformamidinium hexafluorophosphate (F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2PF6, abbreviated as TFFH) to stabilize precursor solution and improve crysallization dynamics simutaneously for high&#8208;performance FAPbI3 (FA = formamidinium)&#8208;based perovskite indoor photovoltaics. The F&#8208;(CH3)4CN2 cations stabilize precursor solution by inhibiting oxidation of I&#8722; and reducing newly generated I0 to I&#8722; simultaneously. The PF6&#8722; anions interact strongly with the Pb&#8208;I framework to passivate undercoordinated Pb2+. Time&#8208;resolved optical diagnostics show a prolonged perovskite crystallization dynamics during which in situ defect passivation is achieved in the precesence of strong FA+&#183;&#183;&#183;TFFH&#183;&#183;&#183;Pb&#8208;I interaction. Simultaneous regulation of precursor solution and crystallizaiton dynamics guarantee larger perovskite grain sizes, better crystal orientation, and less defects of perovskite films as well as more efficient charge extraction in complete solar cells. The optimized solar cells achieve improved reproducibility, better stability and reach effciency of 42.43% at illumination of 1002 lux, which is the highest efficiency among all indoor photovoltaics. It is anticipated that the concurrent stabilization of solutions and regulation of crystallization dynamics will emerge as a prevalent approach for enhancing the reproducibility and efficiency of perovskite.

         <title>A Data&#8208;Driven Approach to Molten Salt Synthesis of N&#8208;rich Carbon Adsorbents for Selective CO2 Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Applying a design of experiments methodology to molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of N&#8208;rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO2/N2 selectivity and appreciable CO2 capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures, such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data&#8208;driven study reveals fundamental relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N&#8208;rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO2 capture. Taking advantage of size&#8208;sieving separation of CO2 (3.30 &#197;) from N2 (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N&#8208;rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N2 adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large low&#8208;pressure CO2 capacity (0.73&#160;mmol/g at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30&#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO2/N2 selectivity (SIAST = 246, adsorbed phase purity = 91%) from a simulated gas stream with only 4% CO2. This study reveals general structure&#8208;function relationships of selective CO2 adsorption by nanoporous carbon adsorbents. Optimized N&#8208;rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO2 adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials, such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal&#8208;organic frameworks.

&lt;p&gt;Applying a design of experiments methodology to molten salt synthesis of nanoporous carbons enables inverse design and optimization of N-rich carbon adsorbents with excellent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity and appreciable CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity for carbon capture via swing adsorption from dilute gas mixtures, such as natural gas combined cycle flue gas. This data-driven study reveals fundamental relationships between the synthesis conditions, physicochemical properties, and achievable selective adsorption performance of N-rich nanoporous carbons derived from molten salt synthesis for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capture. Taking advantage of size-sieving separation of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.30 &#197;) from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (3.64 &#197;) within the turbostratic nanostructure of these N-rich carbons, while limiting deleterious N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption in a weaker adsorption site that harms selectivity, enables a large low-pressure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; capacity (0.73&#160;mmol/g at 30.4&#160;Torr and 30&#176;C) with noteworthy concurrent CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity (S&lt;sub&gt;IAST&lt;/sub&gt; = 246, adsorbed phase purity = 91%) from a simulated gas stream with only 4% CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This study reveals general structure-function relationships of selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption by nanoporous carbon adsorbents. Optimized N-rich porous carbons, with good physicochemical stability, low cost, and moderate regeneration energy, can achieve performance for selective CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption that competes with other classes of advanced porous materials, such as chemisorbing zeolites and functionalized metal-organic frameworks.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Bioorthogonal Guided Activation of Cgas&#8208;STING by Aie Photosensitizer Nanoparticles for Targeted Tumor Therapy And Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) leverage reactive oxygen species (ROS) and control local hyperthermia by photosensitizer to perturb intracellular redox equilibrium, inducing DNA damage in both mitochondria and nucleus, activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, ultimately eliciting antitumor immune responses. However, current photosensitizers are encumbered by limitations such as suboptimal tumor targeting, aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ), and restricted excitation and emission wavelengths. Here, we&#160; designed novel nanoparticles based on aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) photosensitizer (BODTPE) for targeted tumor therapy and near&#8208;infrared II fluorescence imaging (NIR&#8208;II FLI) with enhanced PDT/PTT effects. BODTPE was employed as a monomer, DBCO&#8208;PEG2k&#8208;amine serving as an end&#8208;capping polymer, to synthesize a BODTPE&#8208;containing polymer (DBD). Further, through self&#8208;assembly, DBD and mPEG&#8208;DSPE2k combined to form nanoparticles (NP&#8208;DBD). Notably, the DBCO on the surface of NP&#8208;DBD can react with azide groups on cancer cells pretreated with Ac4ManNAz through a copper&#8208;free click reaction. This innovative formulation led to targeted accumulation of NP&#8208;DBD within tumor sites, a phenomenon convincingly demonstrated in murine tumor models subjected to Ac4ManNAz pretreatment. Significantly, NP&#8208;DBD exhibited a multifaceted effect encompassing PDT/PTT/NIR&#8208;II FLI upon 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, thereby better activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway, culminating in a compelling tumor inhibition effect augmented by robust immune modulation.

         <title>Skyrmion&#8208;Bubble Bundles in An X&#8208;type Sr2Co2Fe28O46 Hexaferrite Above Room Temperature</title>

Abstract
Magnetic skyrmions are spin swirls that possess topological nontriviality and are considered particle&#8208;like entities. They are distinguished by an integer topological charge Q. The presence of skyrmion bundles provides an opportunity to explore the range of values for Q, which is crucial for the advancement of topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q properties. In this study, &#160;we present a new material candidate, Sr2Co2Fe28O46 hexaferrite of the X&#8208;type, which hosts small dipolar skyrmions at room temperature and above. By exploiting reversed magnetic fields from metastable skyrmion bubbles at zero fields, &#160;we can incorporate skyrmion&#8208;bubble bundles with different interior skyrmion/bubble numbers, topological charges, and morphologies at room temperature. &#160;Our experimental findings are consistently supported by micromagnetic simulations. &#160;Our results highlight the versatility of topological spin textures in centrosymmetric uniaxial magnets, thereby paving the way for the development of room&#8208;temperature topological spintronic devices with multi&#8208;Q characteristics.

         <title>Scalable All&#8208;Inorganic Halide Perovskite Photoanodes with &gt;100&#160;h Operational Stability Containing Earth&#8208;Abundant Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The application of halide perovskites in photoelectrochemical generation of solar fuels and feedstocks is hindered by the instability of perovskites in aqueous electrolytes and the use of expensive electrode and catalyst materials, particularly in photoanodes driving kinetically slow water oxidation. Here, we incorporate solely Earth&#8208;abundant materials to fabricate a CsPbBr3&#8208;based photoanode that reaches a low onset potential of +0.4 VRHE and 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 photocurrent density at +1.23 VRHE for water oxidation, close to the radiative efficiency limit of CsPbBr3. This photoanode retains 100% of its stabilized photocurrent density for more than 100&#160;h of operation by replacing once the inexpensive graphite sheet upon signs of deterioration. The improved performance is due to an efficiently electrodeposited NiFeOOH catalyst on a protective self&#8208;adhesive graphite sheet, and enhanced charge transfer achieved by phase engineering of CsPbBr3. Devices with &gt;1 cm2 area, and low&#8208;temperature processing demonstrate the potential for low capital cost, stable, and scalable perovskite photoanodes.

         <title>The State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;Art Solution&#8208;Processed Single Component Organic Photodetectors Achieved by Strong Quenching of Intermolecular Emissive State and High Quadrupole Moment in Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptors</title>

Abstract
A bulk&#8208;heterojunction (BHJ) blend is commonly used as the photoactive layer in organic photodetectors (OPDs) to utilize the donor (D)/acceptor (A) interfacial energetic offset for exciton dissociation. However, this strategy often complicates optimization procedures, raising serious concerns over device processability, reproducibility and stability. Herein, we demonstrate highly efficient OPDs fabricated with single&#8208;component organic semiconductors via solution&#8208;processing. The non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFAs) with strong intrinsic D/A character are used as the photoactive layer, where the emissive intermolecular charge transfer excitonic (CTE) states are formed within &lt;1&#160;ps, and efficient photocurrent generation is achieved via strong quenching of these CTE states by reverse bias. Y6 and IT&#8208;4F based OPDs show excellent OPD performances; low dark current density (&#8764;10&#8722;9 A cm&#8722;2), high responsivity (&#8805; 0.15 A W&#8722;1), high specific detectivity (&gt; 1012 Jones) and fast photo&#8208;response time (&lt; 10 &#181;s), comparable to the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art BHJ OPDs. Together with strong CTE state quenching by electric field, these excellent OPD performances are also attributed to the high quadrupole moments of NFA molecules, which can lead to large interfacial energetic offset for efficient CTE dissociation. Our work opens a new way to realize efficient OPDs using single&#8208;component systems via solution&#8208;processing and provides important molecular design rules.

         <title>Boosting the Viable Water Harvesting in Solar Vapour Generation:From Interfacial Engineering to Devices Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Continuously increasing demand for the life&#8208;critical water resource has induced severe global water shortages. It is imperative to advance effective, economic and environmentally sustainable strategies to augment clean water supply. The present work reviews recent reports on the interfacial engineering to devices design of solar vapour generation (SVG) system for boosting the viability of drinkable water harvesting. Particular emphasis has been placed on the basic principles associated with the interfacial engineering of solar evaporators capable of efficient solar&#8208;to&#8208;thermal conversion, and resulting freshwater vapour via eliminating pollutants from quality&#8208;impaired water sources. We then highlight the critical configurations manufacturing of the devices for fast condensation to harvest potable liquid water. Fundamental and practical challenges, along with prospects for the targeted materials architecture and devices modifications of SVG system are also outlined, aiming to provide future directions and inspiring critical research efforts in this emerging and exciting filed.

         <title>In&#8208;Situ Grown Cu Dendrites Plasmonically Enhance Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution on Facet&#8208;Engineered Cu2o</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Electrocatalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) is widely regarded as one of the most efficient and sustainable strategies for hydrogen production. Up to now, most electrocatalysis research related to HER mainly focuses on stand&#8208;alone electrocatalysis and fails to pay attention to the integration of other driving forces such as light. Herein, Cu2O nanostructures with different exposed crystal facets were synthesized by wet chemical methods for electrocatalytic HER, and it was found that the octahedral Cu2O nanostructures with exposed crystal planes of (111) (O&#8208;Cu2O) had the best hydrogen evolution performance. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations found that the better HER performance on Cu2O (111) facets was attributed to the lower energy barrier in the Heyrovsky step. Operando Raman spectroscopy and ex&#8208;situ characterization techniques showed that Cu2O was reduced during HER, in which Cu dendrites were grown on the surface of the Cu2O nanostructures, resulting in the better HER performance of O&#8208;Cu2O after HER (O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A) compared with that of the as&#8208;prepared O&#8208;Cu2O. DFT calculations indicated that the charge transfer at the Cu2O/Cu interface enhanced its surface electron concentration. Under illumination, the onset potential of O&#8208;Cu2O&#8208;A is ca. 52&#160;mV positive than that of O&#8208;Cu2O, which is induced by the plasmon&#8208;activated electrochemical system consisting of Cu2O and the in&#8208;situ generated Cu dendrites. Incident photon&#8208;to&#8208;current efficiency (IPCE) measurements, ultraviolet&#8208;visible (UV&#8208;Vis) spectroscopy and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) demonstrate the hot electron injection (HEI) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O. Ab initio nonadiabatic molecular dynamics (NAMD) simulations revealed that the transfer of photogenerated electrons (27 fs) from Cu dendrites to Cu2O nanostructures is faster than electron relaxation (170 fs), enhancing its surface plasmons activity, and the HEI of Cu dendrites increases the charge density of Cu2O. These make the energy level of the catalyst be closer to that of H+/H2, evidenced by the plasmon&#8208;enhanced HER electrocatalytic activity.

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Templating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An aerogel production methodology through freezing and lyophilization of engineerable liquid templates, generated via interfacial complexation through electrostatic interactions between the nanoparticles (NPs) and ligands, is introduced. The coined approach enables tuning of the multiscale porosities, 3D architecture, and characteristics of the aerogels by engineering the composition and arrangement of liquid templates toward advanced applications and functions.








Abstract
Modern materials science has witnessed the era of advanced fabrication methods to engineer functionality from the nano&#8208; to macroscales. Versatile fabrication and additive manufacturing methods are developed, but the ability to design a material for a given application is still limited. Here,&#160;a novel strategy that enables target&#8208;oriented manufacturing of ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels with on&#8208;demand characteristics is introduced. The process relies on controllable liquid templating through interfacial complexation to generate tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;structured (multiphase) filamentous liquid templates. The methodology involves nanoscale chemistry and microscale assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid&#8211;liquid interfaces to produce hierarchical macroscopic aerogels featuring multiscale porosity, ultralow density (3.05&#8211;3.41&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and high compressibility (90%) combined with elastic resilience and instant shape recovery. The challenges are overcome facing ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels, including poor mechanical integrity and the inability to form predefined 3D constructs with on&#8208;demand functionality, for a multitude of applications. The controllable nature of the coined methodology enables tunable electromagnetic interference shielding with high specific shielding effectiveness (39 893&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1), and one of the highest&#8208;ever reported oil&#8208;absorption capacities (487 times the initial weight of aerogel for chloroform), to be obtained. These properties originate from the engineerable nature of liquid templating, pushing the boundaries of lightweight materials to systematic function design and applications.

         <title>Buried&#8208;Metal&#8208;Grid Electrodes for Efficient Parallel&#8208;Connected Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

Abstract
The limited conductivity of existing transparent conducting oxide (TCO) greatly restricts the further performance improvement of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) especially for large&#8208;area devices. Herein, we develop buried&#8208;metal&#8208;grid tin&#8208;doped indium oxide (BMG ITO) electrodes to minimize the power loss caused by the undesirable high sheet resistance of TCOs. By burying 140&#8208;nm&#8208;thick metal grids into ITO using a photolithography technique, we reduce the sheet resistance of pristine ITO from 15.0 to 2.7 &#937; sq&#8722;1. The metal step of BMG over ITO has a huge impact on the charge carrier transport in PSCs. The PSCs using BMG ITO with a low metal step deliver power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) significantly better than that of their counterparts with higher metal steps. Moreover, compared with the pristine ITO&#8208;based PSCs, the BMG ITO&#8208;based PSCs show a smaller PCE decrease when scaling up the active area of devices. The parallel&#8208;connected large&#8208;area PSCs with an active area of 102.8 mm2 reach a PCE of 22.5%. The BMG ITO electrodes are also compatible with the fabrication of inverted&#8208;structure PSCs and organic solar cells. Our work demonstrates the great efficacy of improving the conductivity of TCO by BMG and opens up a promising avenue for constructing highly efficient large&#8208;area PSCs.

         <title>Pericardial Delivery of SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin Hydrogel Promotes Endogenous Repair and Electrical Coupling After Myocardial Infarction</title>

Abstract
The SDF&#8208;1&#945;/CXCR4 axis contributes to myocardial protection after MI by recruiting endogenous stem cells into the ischemic tissue. However, excessive inflammatory macrophages are also recruited simultaneously, aggravating myocardial damage. More seriously, the increased inflammation contributes to abnormal cardiomyocyte electrical coupling, leading to inhomogeneities in ventricular conduction and retarded conduction velocity. It is highly desirable to selectively recruit the stem cells but block the inflammation. In this work, the SDF&#8208;1&#945;&#8208;encapsulated Puerarin (PUE) hydrogel (SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE) that is capable of enhancing endogenous stem cell homing and simultaneously polarizing the recruited monocyte/macrophages into a repairing phenotype. Flow cytometry analysis of the treated heart tissue shows that endogenous bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs), hemopoietic stem cells (HSCs), and immune cells are recruited while SDF&#8208;1&#945;@PUE efficiently polarized the recruited monocytes/macrophages into the M2 type. These macrophages influence the preservation of Cx43 expression which modulates intercellular coupling and improves electrical conduction. Furthermore, by taking advantage of the improved &#8220;soil&#8221;, the recruited stem cells mediates an improved cardiac function by preventing deterioration, promoting neovascular architecture, and reducing infarct size. Our findings demonstrate a promising therapeutic platform for MI that not only facilitates heart regeneration but also reduces the risk of cardiac arrhythmias.

         <title>Functional Materials for Subcellular Targeting Strategies in Cancer Therapy: Progress and Prospects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapies have made significant progress in cancer treatment. However, tumor adjuvant therapy still faces challenges due to the intrinsic heterogeneity of cancer, genomic instability, and the formation of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Functional materials possess unique biological properties such as long circulation times, tumor&#8208;specific targeting, and immunomodulation. The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure&#8208;targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug&#8208;related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeting functional materials in precision oncology. We believe that our review will serve as an excellent cutting&#8208;edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle&#8208;targeted cancer therapy.

The combination of functional materials with natural substances and nanotechnology has led to the development of smart biomaterials with multiple functions, high biocompatibilities, and negligible immunogenicities, which can be used for precise cancer treatment. Recently, subcellular structure-targeting functional materials have received particular attention in various biomedical applications including the diagnosis, sensing, and imaging of tumors and drug delivery. Subcellular organelle-targeting materials can precisely accumulate therapeutic agents in organelles, considerably reduce the threshold dosages of therapeutic agents, and minimize drug-related side effects. This review provides a systematic and comprehensive overview of the research progress in subcellular organelle-targeted cancer therapy based on functional nanomaterials. Moreover, it explains the challenges and prospects of subcellular organelle-targeting functional materials in precision oncology. We believe that our review will serve as an excellent cutting-edge guide for researchers in the field of subcellular organelle-targeted cancer therapy.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
The vector characteristics of light and the vectorial transformations during its transmission lay a foundation for polarized photodetection of objects, which broadens the applications of related detectors in complex environments. With the breakthrough of low&#8208;dimensional materials (LDMs) in optics and electronics over the past few years, the combination of these novel LDMs and traditional working modes is expected to bring new development opportunities in this field. Here,&#160;we&#160;mainly focus on the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress of LDMs as polarization&#8208;sensitive components in polarized photodetection and even the imaging, with emphasis on the relationship between traditional working principle of polarized photodetectors (PPs) and photoresponse mechanisms of LDMs. Particularly, from the view of constitutive equation, the existing works are reorganized, reclassified and reviewed. The perspectives on the opportunities and challenges are also discussed.&#160;We&#160;hope that this work can provide a more general overview in the use of LDMs in this field, sorting out the way of related devices for &#8220;more than Moore&#8221; or even the &#8220;beyond Moore&#8221; research.

         <title>Electrochemically Controlled Hydrogels with Electrotunable Permeability and Uniaxial Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. This work demonstrates how the swelling of hydrogels from cellulose nanofibrils and carbon nanotubes can be electrochemically controlled to achieve electrochemical osmotic actuation. This new materials system paves the way for integrated actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation in electrotunable separation membranes or soft actuators.








Abstract
The unique properties of hydrogels enable the design of life&#8208;like soft intelligent systems. However, stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels still suffer from limited actuation control. Direct electronic control of electronically conductive hydrogels can solve this challenge and allow direct integration with modern electronic systems. An electrochemically controlled nanowire composite hydrogel with high in&#8208;plane conductivity that stimulates a uniaxial electrochemical osmotic expansion is demonstrated. This materials system allows precisely controlled shape&#8208;morphing at only &#8722;1&#160;V, where capacitive charging of the hydrogel bulk leads to a large uniaxial expansion of up to 300%, caused by the ingress of &#8776;700 water molecules per electron&#8211;ion pair. The material retains its state when turned off, which is ideal for electrotunable membranes as the inherent coupling between the expansion and mesoporosity enables electronic control of permeability for adaptive separation, fractionation, and distribution. Used as electrochemical osmotic hydrogel actuators, they achieve an electroactive pressure of up to 0.7&#160;MPa (1.4&#160;MPa vs dry) and a work density of &#8776;150&#160;kJ&#160;m&#8722;3 (2&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3&#160;vs dry). This new materials system paves the way to integrate actuation, sensing, and controlled permeation into advanced soft intelligent systems.

         <title>Topological Flat Bands in 2D Breathing&#8208;Kagome Lattice Nb3TeCl7</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The experimental evidence of the nearly independent single topological flat band (FB) generated by the 2D Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layer&#160;in Nb3TeCl7 with identical on&#8208;site energy of Nb sites is reported. The possibility of modulating the bandwidth, energy position, and topology of the FB by altering the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites in the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome frustrated geometry is disclosed.








Abstract
Flat bands&#160;(FBs) can appear in two&#8208;dimensional (2D) geometrically frustrated systems caused by quantum destructive interference (QDI). However, the scarcity of pure 2D frustrated crystal structures in natural materials makes FBs hard to be identified, let alone modulate FBs relating to electronic properties. Here, the experimental evidence of the complete electronic QDI induced FB contributed by the 2D breathing&#8208;kagome layers of Nb atoms in Nb3TeCl7 (NTC) is reported. An identical chemical state and 2D localization characteristics of the Nb breathing&#8208;kagome layers are experimentally confirmed, based on which NTC is demonstrated to be a superior concrete candidate for the breathing&#8208;kagome tight&#8208;binding model. Furthermore, it theoretically establishes the tunable roles of the on&#8208;site energy over Nb sites on bandwidth, energy position, and topology of FBs in NTC. This work opens an aveanue to manipulate FB characteristics in these 4d transition&#8208;metal&#8208;based breathing&#8208;kagome materials.

         <title>Bimetallic Organic Frameworks of High Piezovoltage for Sono&#8208;Piezo Dynamic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel piezoelectric Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework (MT&#8208;MOF) of high piezovoltage is designed for new sono&#8208;piezoelectric dynamic therapy with significant antitumor efficiency in vitro and in vivo. Strikingly, the MT&#8208;MOF, which has a piezopotential of 2.9&#160;V, exciting charges under low&#8208;intensity ultrasound, not only causes ROS overproduction but also disrupts the polarization of the plasma and mitochondrial membranes inducing intense cytotoxicity.








Abstract
Piezoelectric materials produce charges to directly act on cancer medium or promote the generation of&#160;reactive oxygen species (ROS) for novel tumor therapy triggered by sonography. Currently, piezoelectric sonosensitizers are mainly used to catalyze ROS generation by the band&#8208;tilting effect for sonodynamic therapy. However, it remains a challenge for piezoelectric sonosensitizers to produce high piezovoltages to overcome the bandgap barrier for direct charge generation. Herein, Mn&#8211;Ti bimetallic organic framework tetragonal nanosheets (MT&#8208;MOF TNS) are designed to produce high piezovoltages for novel sono&#8208;piezo (SP)&#8208;dynamic therapy (SPDT) with remarkable antitumor efficacy in vitro and in vivo. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS comprise non&#8208;centrosymmetric secondary building units of Mn&#8211;Ti&#8211;oxo cyclic octamers with charge heterogeneous components for piezoelectricity. The MT&#8208;MOF TNS promotes strong sonocavitation to induce piezoelectric effect with a high SP voltage (2.9&#160;V) in situ, to directly excite charges, which is validated by SP&#8208;excited luminescence spectrometry. The SP voltage and charges depolarize the mitochondrial and plasma membrane potentials and cause ROS overproduction and serious tumor cell damage. Importantly, MT&#8208;MOF TNS can be decorated with targeting molecules and chemotherapeutics for more severe tumor regression by combining SPDT with chemodynamic therapy and chemotherapy. This report develops a fascinating MT&#8208;MOF piezoelectric nano&#8208;semiconductor and provides an efficient SPDT strategy for tumor treatment.

         <title>Circular Reprocessing of Thermoset Polyurethane Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt&#8208;reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low&#8208;density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as&#8208;synthesized polyurethane foams.








Abstract
Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross&#8208;linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt&#8208;processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin&#8208;screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam&#8208;to&#8208;foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low&#8208;density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as&#8208;synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.

&lt;p&gt;Foam-to-foam reprocessing of thermoset polyurethane is reported for circular recycling of polyurethane products. As carbamate exchange catalysts enable melt-reprocessing of thermoset polyurethanes, extrusion foaming and foam injection molding of polyurethane are demonstrated, and the potential scalability is assessed. The structure&#8211;processing&#8211;property relationship of the processes is investigated to achieve low-density foam with comparable mechanical properties to those of as-synthesized polyurethane foams.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thermoset polyurethane (PU) foams are widely used in industrial applications, but they cannot be recycled by conventional melt reprocessing because of their cross-linked structures. The introduction of carbamate exchange catalysts converts thermoset PU into covalent adaptable networks (CANs), which are amenable to reprocessing at elevated temperatures. However, this approach has produced solid PU films, which have fewer uses and lower commercial demand. In this work, simultaneous reprocessing and refoaming of thermoset PU foams is demonstrated by leveraging the melt-processability of PU CANs and allowing cell growth by gas generation in a twin-screw extruder. The optimal operating temperature of the refoaming process is determined through chemical, thermal, and structural analysis of PU foam extrudates. The foam-to-foam extrusion process produces controllable, continuous, and uniform foam structures, as characterized by cell diameter and cell number density. Low-density PU foams are obtained through a process simulating injection molding. The compression properties of reprocessed PU foam are compared with as-synthesized PU foam to demonstrate efficacy of the refoaming processes. These results demonstrate that PU foams can be prepared through recycling while maintaining microstructural and chemical integrity. In the future, this strategy may be applied to thermoset PU foams of various chemical compositions and shows promise for scalability.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Polymer Dielectric Constant and Loss Via Aluminum Oxo Macrocycle Dopants for High&#8208;Performance Neuromorphic Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The dielectric layer is crucial in regulating the overall performance of field&#8208;effect transistors (FETs), the key component in central processing units, sensors, and displays. Despite considerable efforts being devoted to developing high&#8208;permittivity (k) dielectrics, limited progress has been made due to the inherent trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss. Here, we present a solution by designing a monodispersed disk&#8208;shaped Ce&#8208;Al&#8208;O&#8208;macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3&#8208;aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to 7&#8208;fold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage&#8208;current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster&#8208;doped polymer dielectrics give near three&#8208;orders source&#8208;drain current increments while maintaining low&#8208;level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge&#8208;carrier mobilities (up to 2.45 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) and on/off ratios. This cluster&#8208;doping strategy is generalizable and shows great promise for ultralow&#8208;power photoelectric synapses and neuromorphic retinas. This work successfully breaks the trade&#8208;off between dielectric constant and loss and offers a unique design for polymer composite dielectrics.

Here, we present a solution by designing a monodispersed disk-shaped Ce-Al-O-macrocycle as a dopant in polymer dielectrics. The molecule features a central Ce(III) core connected with eight Al atoms through sixteen bridging hydroxyls and eight 3-aminophenyl peripheries. The incorporation of this macrocycle in polymer dielectrics results in an up to 7-fold increase in dielectric constants and up to 89% reduction in dielectric loss at low frequencies. Moreover, the leakage-current densities decrease, and the breakdown strengths are improved by 63%. Relying on the above merits, FETs bearing cluster-doped polymer dielectrics give near three-orders source-drain current increments while maintaining low-level leakage/off currents, resulting in much higher charge-carrier mobilities (up to 2.45 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and on/off ratios.

         <title>Characterization, Structure, and Reactivity of Hydroxyl groups on Metal&#8208;Oxide Cluster Nodes of Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks: Structural Diversity and Keys to Reactivity and Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Among the most stable metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) are those incorporating nodes that are metal oxide clusters with frames such as Zr6O8. This review is a summary of the structure, bonding, and reactivity of MOF node hydroxyl groups, emphasizing those bonded to nodes containing aluminum and zirconium ions. Hydroxyl groups are often present on these nodes, sometimes balancing the charges of the metal ions. They arise during MOF syntheses in aqueous media or in post&#8208;synthesis treatments. They have been identified with infrared and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopies and characterized by their reactivities with polar compounds such as alcohols. Terminal OH, paired&#160;&#956;2&#8208;OH, and aqua groups&#160;on nodes are catalytic sites in numerous reactions. Relatively unreactive hydroxyl groups (such as isolated&#160;&#956;2&#8208;OH groups) may replace reactive groups and inhibit catalysis; some node hydroxyl groups (e.g.,&#160;&#956;3&#8208;OH) are mere spectators in catalysis. There are similarities between MOF node hydroxyl groups and those on the surfaces of bulk metal oxides, zeolites, and enzymes, but the comparisons are mostly inexact, and much remains to be understood about MOF node hydroxyl group chemistry. We posit that understanding and controlling this chemistry will lead to tailored MOFs and improved adsorbents and catalysts.

         <title>Semiconducting Polymer Nanospherical Nucleic Acid Probe for Transcriptomic Imaging of Cancer Chemo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Real&#8208;time in vivo imaging of RNA can enhance our understanding of physio&#8208;pathological processes. However, most nucleic acid&#8208;based sensors have poor resistance to nucleases and limited photophysical properties, making them suboptimal for this purpose. To address this, we have developed a semiconducting polymer nanospherical nucleic acid probe (SENSE) for transcriptomic imaging of cancer immunity in living mice. SENSE consists of a semiconducting polymer backbone covalently linked with a recognition DNA strand, which is complemented by a dye&#8208;labelled signal DNA strand. Upon detection of a targeted T lymphocyte transcript (Gzmb: granzyme B), the signal strand is released from SENSE, leading to a fluorescence enhancement of the signal dye and superb sensitivity for signal correlation with transcript levels. The always&#8208;on fluorescence of the SP core in SENSE also serves as an internal reference for tracking SENSE uptake in tumours. Thus, SENSE has the du&#8208;al&#8208;signal channel that allows for ratiometric imaging of Gzmb transcripts in the tumour of living mice for evaluating chemo&#8208;immunotherapy; moreover, it has demonstrated sensitivity and specificity comparable to flow cytometry and qPCR, with the added benefit of a faster and simpler means of T cell detection in resected tumours. Therefore, SENSE represents a promising tool for in vivo RNA imaging.

         <title>Multi&#8208;sensing Platform Based on Two&#8208;Dimensional Monoelement Germanane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Covalently functionalized germanane is a novel type of fluorescent probe that can be employed in material science and analytical sensing. Here, we developed a fluorometric sensing platform based on methyl&#8208;functionalized germanane (CH3Ge) for gas (humidity and ammonia) sensing, pH (1&#8211;9) sensing, and anti&#8208;counterfeiting. A luminescence (red&#8208;orange) is seen when a gas molecule intercalates into the interlayer space of CH3Ge and the luminescence disappears upon deintercalation. This allows for direct detection of gas absorption via fluorometric measurements of the CH3Ge. Structural and optical properties of CH3Ge with intercalated gas molecules are investigated by density functional theory. To demonstrate real&#8208;time and on&#8208;the&#8208;spot testing, we first precisely quantified absorbed gas molecules (humidity and ammonia) by CH3Ge using a smartphone camera with an installed color intensity processing application (APP). Further, CH3Ge film was integrated into real food packets (e.g., fish and milk) to monitor the shelf life of perishable foods. The band gap changes and optical response of CH3Ge to various gas molecules were examined using density functional theory calculations. Finally, CH3Ge&#8208;based rewritable paper was applied in water jet printing to illustrate the potential for secret communication with quick coloration and good reversibility by water evaporation.

         <title>Silicon&#8208;Lattice&#8208;Matched Boron&#8208;Doped Gallium Phosphide: A Scalable Acousto&#8208;Optic Platform</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The compact size, scalability, and strongly confined fields in integrated photonic devices enable new functionalities in photonic networking and information processing, both classical and quantum. Gallium phosphide (GaP) is a promising material for active integrated photonics due to its high refractive index, wide band gap, strong nonlinear properties, and large acousto&#8208;optic figure&#160;of merit. In this work we&#160;demonstrate that silicon&#8208;lattice&#8208;matched boron&#8208;doped GaP (BGaP), grown at the 12&#8208;inch wafer scale, provides similar functionalities as GaP. BGaP optical resonators exhibit intrinsic quality factors exceeding 25,000 and 200,000 at visible and telecom wavelengths respectively. We&#160;further demonstrate the electromechanical generation of low&#8208;loss acoustic waves and an integrated acousto&#8208;optic (AO) modulator. High&#8208;resolution spatial and compositional mapping, combined with ab initio calculations indicate two candidates for the excess optical loss in the visible band: the silicon&#8208;GaP interface and boron dimers. These results demonstrate the promise of the BGaP material platform for the development of scalable AO technologies at telecom and provide potential pathways toward higher performance at shorter&#160;wavelengths.

         <title>Uracil Induced Simultaneously Strengthening Grain Boundaries and Interfaces Enables High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Solar Cells with Superior Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The operational stability is a huge obstacle to further commercialization of perovskite solar cells. To address this critical issue, in this work, we introduced uracil as a &#8220;binder&#8221; into the perovskite film to simultaneously improve the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability. Uracil can efficiently passivate defects and strengthen grain boundaries to enhance the stability of perovskite films. Moreover, the uracil also strengthens the interface between the perovskite and the SnO2 electron transport layer to increase the binding force. The uracil&#8208;modified devices deliver a champion PCE of 24.23% (certificated 23.19%) with negligible hysteresis at active area of 0.0625 cm2. In particular, the optimal device exhibits over 90% of its initial PCE after tracking for approximately 6000 hours at its maximum power point (MPP) under continuous light, indicating its superior operational stability. Moreover, the devices also show great reproducibility in both PCE and operational stability.

         <title>3D Assembly of Mxene Networks using a Ceramic Backbone with Controlled Porosity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal carbides (MXenes) are novel two&#8208;dimensional (2D) nanomaterials with exceptional properties, promising significant impact in applications such as energy storage and conversion, and catalysis. A major barrier preventing the widespread use of MXenes is the lack of methods for assembling MXene in 3D space without restacking, which degrades their performance. Here, we successfully overcome this challenge by introducing a novel material system: a 3D MXene network on a porous ceramic backbone. The backbone dictates the network's 3D architecture while providing mechanical strength, gas/liquid permeability, and other beneficial properties. Freeze casting is used to fabricate a silica backbone with open pores and controlled porosity, a MXene dispersion is infiltrated into the backbone using capillary flow, and the system is dried to conformally coat the pore walls, creating an interconnected 3D&#8208;MXene network. The fabrication approach is reproducible, and the MXene&#8208;infiltrated porous silica (MX&#8208;PS) system is highly conductive (e.g., 340 S&#183;m&#8722;1). The electrical conductivity is controlled by the porosity distribution, MXene concentration, and infiltration cycles. Sandwich&#8208;type supercapacitors with MX&#8208;PS electrodes produce excellent areal capacitance (7.24 F&#183;cm&#8722;2) and energy density (0.32 mWh&#183;cm&#8722;2) with only 6% added MXene mass. This approach of creating 3D architectures of 2D nanomaterials will significantly impact many engineering applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;assembly of Structured Colloidal Gels for High Resolution 3d Micropatterning of Proteins at Scale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Self&#8208;assembly, the spontaneous ordering of components into patterns, is widespread in nature and fundamental to generating function across length scales. Morphogen gradients in biological development are paradigmatic as both products and effectors of self&#8208;assembly and various attempts have been made to reproduce such gradients in biomaterial design. To date, approaches have typically utilised top&#8208;down fabrication techniques which, while allowing high resolution control, are limited by scale and require chemical cross&#8208;linking steps to stabilise morphogen patterns in time. Here, we develop a bottom&#8208;up approach to protein patterning based on a novel binary reaction&#8208;diffusion process where protein's function as diffusive reactants to assembly a nanoclay&#8208;protein composite hydrogel. Using this approach, we were able to generate scalable and highly stable 3D patterns of target proteins down to sub&#8208;cellular resolution through only physical interactions between clay nanoparticles and the proteins and ions present in blood. Patterned nanoclay gels were able to guide cell behaviour to precisely template bone tissue formation in vivo. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of stabilising 3D gradients of biological signals through self&#8208;assembly processes and open up new possibilities for morphogen&#8208;based therapeutic strategies and models of biological development and repair.

         <title>Interlocking&#8208;Governed Ultra&#8208;Strong and Highly Conductive MXene Fibers Through Fluidics&#8208;Assisted Thermal Drawing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;performance MXene fibers are always of significant interest for flexible textile&#8208;based devices. However, achieving high mechanical property and electrical conductivity remains challenging due to the uncontrolled loose microstructures of MXene nanosheets. Herein, we demonstrate high&#8208;performance MXene fibers directly obtained through fluidics&#8208;assisted thermal drawing. Tablet interlocks are formed at the interface layer between the outer cyclic olefin copolymer and inner MXene nanosheets due to the thermal drawing induced stresses, resulting in thousands of meters long macroscopic compact MXene fibers with ultra&#8208;high tensile strength, toughness, and outstanding electrical conductivity. Furthermore, large&#8208;scale woven textiles constructed by these fibers offer exceptional electromagnetic interference shielding performance with excellent durability and stability. Such an effective and sustainable approach can be applied to produce functional fibers for applications in both daily life and aerospace.

         <title>Giant Atomic Swirl in Graphene Bilayers with Biaxial Heterostrain</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Biaxial heterostrain in bilayer graphene leads to a new atomic lattice relaxation to minimize the stacking energy. Elastic energy is stored in solitons hosting topological states. This demonstrates that heterostrain can be an additional tuning parameter in moir&#233; materials opening new possibilities for moir&#233; engineering.








Abstract
The study of moir&#233; engineering started with the advent of van der Waals heterostructures, in which stacking 2D layers with different lattice constants leads to a moir&#233; pattern controlling their electronic properties. The field entered a new era when it&#160;was&#160;found that adjusting the twist between two graphene layers led to strongly&#8208;correlated&#8208;electron physics and topological effects associated with atomic relaxation. A twist is now routinely used to adjust the properties of 2D materials. This study investigates a new type of moir&#233; superlattice in bilayer graphene when one layer is biaxially strained with respect to the other&#8212;so&#8208;called biaxial heterostrain. Scanning tunneling microscopy measurements uncover spiraling electronic states associated with a novel symmetry&#8208;breaking atomic reconstruction at small biaxial heterostrain. Atomistic calculations using experimental parameters as inputs reveal that a giant atomic swirl forms around regions of aligned stacking to reduce the mechanical energy of the bilayer. Tight&#8208;binding calculations performed on the relaxed structure show that the observed electronic states decorate spiraling domain wall solitons as required by topology. This study establishes biaxial heterostrain as an important parameter to be harnessed for the next step of moir&#233; engineering in van der Waals&#160;multilayers.

         <title>Inhabiting Inactive Transition by Coupling Function of Oxygen Vacancies and Fe&#9472;C Bonds achieving Long Cycle Life of an Iron&#8208;Based Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3, endowing an Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.








Abstract
Fe&#8208;based battery&#8208;type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon&#8208;based double&#8208;layer&#8208;type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;&#8208;like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron&#8208;based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe3O4(v)@Fe3C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &#947;&#8208;Fe2O3 phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe&#8208;based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;The coupling effect of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds increases the reaction energy barrier and restrains the irreversible structure reconstruction from FeOOH to &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, endowing an Fe@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(v)&lt;/sup&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@C electrode with the coexistence of high capacity, excellent rate capability, and outstanding cycle stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fe-based battery-type anode materials with many faradaic reaction sites have higher capacities than carbon-based double-layer-type materials and can be used to develop aqueous supercapacitors with high energy density. However, as an insurmountable bottleneck, the severe capacity fading and poor cyclability derived from the inactive transition hinder their commercial application in asymmetric supercapacitors (ASCs). In this work, driven by the &#8220;oxygen pumping&#8221; mechanism, oxygen-vacancy-rich Fe@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(v)&lt;/sup&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@C nanoparticles that consist of a unique &#8220;fruit with stone&#8221;-like structure are developed, and they exhibit enhanced specific capacity and fast charge/discharge capability. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that the capacity attenuation in conventional iron-based anodes is greatly alleviated in the the Fe@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;(v)&lt;/sup&gt;@Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C@C anode because the irreversible phase transition to the inactive &lt;i&gt;&#947;&lt;/i&gt;-Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; phase can be inhibited by a robust barrier formed by the coupling of oxygen vacancies and Fe&#9472;C bonds, which promotes cycle stability (93.5% capacity retention after 24&#160;000 cycles). An ASC fabricated using this Fe-based anode is also observed to have extraordinary durability, achieving capacity retention of 96.4% after 38&#160;000 cycles, and a high energy density of 127.6&#160;W&#160;h&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at a power density of 981&#160;W&#160;kg&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
Shape&#8208;programmable liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane&#8208;based multimode actuators triggered by light&#8208;driven molecular motors are prepared. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved.








Abstract
In recent years, light&#8208;driven soft actuators have been rapidly developed as enablers in the fabrication of artificial robots and biomimetic devices. However, it remains challenging to amplify molecular isomerization to multiple modes of macroscopic actuation with large amplitude and complex motions. Here, a strategy is reported to build a light&#8208;responsive liquid&#8208;crystalline polyurethane elastomer by phototriggered overcrowded alkene&#8208;based molecular motors. A trifunctional molecular motor modified with an ethylene glycol spacer on the rotor and stator functions as a crosslinker and unidirectional stirrer that amplifies molecular motion into macroscopic movement. The shape&#8208;programmable polymeric film presents superior mechanical properties and characteristic shape&#8208;memory effect. Furthermore, diverse modes of motions including bending, unwinding, and contracting with tunable actuation speed over a wide range are achieved. Such research is hoped to pave a new way for the design of advanced light&#8208;responsive soft actuators and robots.

         <title>Fundamentals, Advances, and Artifacts in Circularly Polarized Luminescence (CPL) Spectroscopy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Circularly polarized luminescence enables exciting applications such as holography, advanced cryptography, and energy&#8208;efficient displays. This Perspective lays out the fundamentals of the corresponding spectroscopic technique and reports a home&#8208;built setup. The corrections necessary for accurate measurements as well as the most common artifacts and pitfalls to avoid are detailed. Custom operating software is made available free of charge.








Abstract
Objects are chiral when they cannot be superimposed with their mirror image. Materials can emit chiral light with an excess of right&#8208; or left&#8208;handed circular polarization. This circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) is key to promising future applications, such as highly efficient displays, holography, sensing, enantiospecific discrimination, synthesis of drugs, quantum computing, and cryptography. Here, a practical guide to CPL spectroscopy is provided. First, the fundamentals of the technique are laid out and a detailed account of recent experimental advances to achieve highly sensitive and accurate measurements is given, including all corrections required to obtain reliable results. Then the most common artifacts and pitfalls are discussed, especially for the study of thin films, for example, based on molecules, polymers, or halide perovskites, as opposed to dilute solutions of emitters. To facilitate the adoption by others, custom operating software is made publicly available, equipping the reader with the tools needed for successful and accurate CPL determination.

         <title>A High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Oxides&#8208;Based Memristor: Outstanding Resistive Switching Performance and Mechanisms in Atomic Structural Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Resistive random&#8208;access memory based on high&#8208;entropy oxide exhibits excellent performance, such as low power consumption, long retention time, and excellent endurance. The excellent properties are due to the interactions among the five metal cations and the entropy stabilization effect. The switching behavior is induced by the migration of oxygen ions, leading to a structural transformation between spinel and rock salt.








Abstract
The application of high&#8208;entropy oxide (HEO) has attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their unique structural characteristics, such as excellent electrochemical properties and long&#8208;term cycling stability. However, the application of resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) has not been extensively studied, and the switching mechanism of HEO&#8208;based RRAM has yet to be thoroughly investigated. In this study, HEO (Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni)3O4 with a spinel structure is epitaxially grown on a Nb:STO conductive substrate, and Pt metal is deposited as the top electrode. After the resistive&#8208;switching operation, some regions of the spinel structure are transformed into a rock&#8208;salt structure and analyzed using advanced transmission electron microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy. From the results of X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, only specific elements would change their valence state, which results in excellent resistive&#8208;switching properties with a high on/off ratio on the order of 105, outstanding endurance (&gt;4550 cycles), long retention time (&gt;104 s), and high stability, which suggests that HEO is a promising RRAM material.

         <title>Photoinduced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mechanical cloaking in microgels: a diarylethene photoswitch is introduced as a co&#8208;crosslinker into PVCL microgels. Light&#8208;induced photoswitching of the diaryethene results in a phase&#8208;transition shift and thus changes the swelling status of microgels at a fixed temperature, rendering them differently reactive to mechanical force.








Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as a crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase&#8208;transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8211;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated by the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photoinduced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Constructing Cooperative Interface via Bi&#8208;Functional COF for Facilitating the Sulfur Conversion and Li+ Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Lithium&#8208;sulfur (Li&#8208;S) batteries stand out for their high theoretical specific capacity, cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the practical implementation of Li&#8208;S batteries is hindered by issues such as the shuttle effect, tardy redox kinetics, and dendrite growth. Herein, an appealingly designed covalent organic framework (COF) with bi&#8208;functional active sites of cyanide groups and polysulfide chains (COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S) is developed as cooperative functional promoters to simultaneously address dendrites and shuttle effect issues. Combining in&#8208;situ techniques and theoretical calculations, it can be demonstrated that the unique chemical architecture of COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S is capable of performing the following functions: (1) The COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S delivers significantly enhanced Li+ transport capability due to abundant ion&#8208;hopping sites (cyano&#8208;groups); (2) it functions as a selective ion sieve by regulating the dynamic behavior of polysulfide anions and Li+, thus inhibiting shuttle effect and dendrite growth; (3) by acting as a redox mediator, the COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S can effectively control the electrochemical behavior of polysulfides and enhance their conversion kinetics. Based on the above advantages, the COF&#8208;CN&#8208;S endows Li&#8208;S batteries with excellent performance. This study highlights the significance of interface modification and offers novel insights into the rational design of organic materials in Li&#8208;S realm.

&lt;p&gt;Lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries stand out for their high theoretical specific capacity, cost-effectiveness. However, the practical implementation of Li-S batteries is hindered by issues such as the shuttle effect, tardy redox kinetics, and dendrite growth. Herein, an appealingly designed covalent organic framework (COF) with bi-functional active sites of cyanide groups and polysulfide chains (COF-CN-S) is developed as cooperative functional promoters to simultaneously address dendrites and shuttle effect issues. Combining &lt;i&gt;in-situ&lt;/i&gt; techniques and theoretical calculations, it can be demonstrated that the unique chemical architecture of COF-CN-S is capable of performing the following functions: (1) The COF-CN-S delivers significantly enhanced Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; transport capability due to abundant ion-hopping sites (cyano-groups); (2) it functions as a selective ion sieve by regulating the dynamic behavior of polysulfide anions and Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, thus inhibiting shuttle effect and dendrite growth; (3) by acting as a redox mediator, the COF-CN-S can effectively control the electrochemical behavior of polysulfides and enhance their conversion kinetics. Based on the above advantages, the COF-CN-S endows Li-S batteries with excellent performance. This study highlights the significance of interface modification and offers novel insights into the rational design of organic materials in Li-S realm.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>3D Nanostructuring of Phase&#8208;Change Materials Using Focused Ion Beam Towards Versatile Optoelectronics Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
In the past few years, phase&#8208;change materials have become increasingly important in nanophotonics and optoelectronics. Sizable optical contrast and added degree of freedom from phase switching drive the use of phase&#8208;change materials in various optical devices with outstanding results and potential for real&#8208;world applications. The local crystallization/amorphization of phase&#8208;change materials and the corresponding reflectance tunning by the crystallized/amorphized region size have potential applications, e.g. for future dynamic display devices. Although the resolution is much higher than current display devices, the pixel sizes in those devices are limited by the locally switchable structure size. Here, we reduce the spot sizes further by using ion beams instead of laser beams and dramatically increase pixel density, demonstrating superior resolution. In addition, the power to sputter away materials can be utilized in creating nanostructures with relative height differences and local contrast. Our experiment focuses on one archetypal phase&#8208;change material, Sb2Se3, prepared by pulsed&#8208;laser deposition on a reflective gold substrate. We demonstrate that we can produce structural colors and achieve reflectance tunning by focused ion beam milling/sputtering of phase&#8208;change materials at the nanoscale. Furthermore, we show that the local structuring of phase&#8208;change materials by focused ion beam can produce high pixel&#8208;density display devices with superior resolutions.

         <title>Phosphorescent Carbene&#8208;Gold&#8208;Arylacetylide Materials as Emitters for Near UV&#8208;OLEDs</title>

Abstract
A series of carbene&#8208;gold&#8208;acetylide complexes [(BiCAAC)AuCC]nC6H5&#8208;n (n = 1, Au1; n = 2, Au2; n = 3, Au3; BiCAAC = bicyclic(alkyl)(amino)carbene) have been synthesized in high yields. All complexes show excellent thermal stability up to 342&#176;C. Compounds Au1&#8211;Au3 exhibit deep&#8208;blue to blue&#8208;green phosphorescence with good quantum yields up to 43% in all media. An increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties in gold complexes Au1&#8211;Au3 increases the extinction coefficients in the UV&#8208;vis spectra and stronger oscillator strength coefficients supported by theoretical calculations. The luminescence radiative rates decrease with an increase of the (BiCAAC)Au moieties. The time&#8208;dependent density functional theory (TD&#8208;DFT) study supports a charge&#8208;transfer nature of the phosphorescence due to the large (0.5&#8211;0.6&#160;eV) energy gap between singlet excited (S1) and triplet excited (T1) states. Transient luminescence study reveals the presence of both non&#8208;structured UV prompt&#8208;fluorescence and vibronically resolved long&#8208;lived phosphorescence 428&#160;nm. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLED) have been fabricated by physical vapour deposition with 2,8&#8208;bis(diphenylphosphoryl)dibenzo[b,d]furan (PPF) as a host material with complex Au1. The near&#8208;UV electroluminescence is observed at 405&#160;nm with device efficiency of 1% while demonstrating OLED device lifetime LT50 up to 20&#160;min at practical brightness of 10 nits, indicating a highly promising class of materials to develop stable UV&#8208;OLEDs.

         <title>Indoor Self&#8208;Powered Perovskite Optoelectronics with Ultraflexible Monochromatic Light Source</title>

Abstract
Self&#8208;powered skin optoelectronics fabricated on ultrathin polymer films is emerging as one of the most promising components for the next&#8208;generation Internet of Things (IoT) technology. However, a longstanding challenge is the device underperformance owing to the low process temperature of polymer substrates. In addition, broadband electroluminescence (EL) based on organic or polymer semiconductors inevitably suffers from periodic spectral distortion due to Fabry&#8208;P&#233;rot (FP) interference upon substrate bending, preventing advanced applications. Here, we present ultraflexible skin optoelectronics integrating high&#8208;performance solar cells and monochromatic light&#8208;emitting diodes using solution&#8208;processed perovskite semiconductors. We demonstrate n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells and perovskite nanocrystal light&#8208;emitting diodes (PNC&#8208;LEDs), with power&#8208;conversion and current efficiencies of 18.2% and 15.2&#160;cd A&#8722;1, respectively, on ultrathin polymer substrates with high thermal stability, which is a record&#8208;high efficiency for ultraflexible perovskite solar cell. The narrowband EL with a full width at half&#8208;maximum of 23&#160;nm successfully eliminates FP interference, yielding bending&#8208;insensitive spectra even under 50% of mechanical compression. Photo&#8208;plethysmography using our skin optoelectronic device demonstrated a signal selectivity of 98.2% at 87&#160;bpm pulse. The results presented here pave the way to inexpensive and high&#8208;performance ultrathin optoelectronics for self&#8208;powered applications such as wearable displays and indoor IoT sensors.

         <title>Reversible Ultrafast Chiroptical Responses in Planar Plasmonic Nano&#8208;Oligomer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
(Ultracompact chiral plasmonic nanostructures with unique chiral light&#8208;matter interactions are vital for future photonic technologies. However, previous studies are limited to reporting their steady&#8208;state performance, presenting a fundamental obstacle to the development of high&#8208;speed optical devices with polarization sensitivity. Here, we provide a comprehensive analysis of ultrafast chiroptical response of chiral gold nano&#8208;oligomers using time&#8208;resolved polarimetric measurements. We observe significant differences in terms of the absorption intensity, thus hot electron generation, and hot carrier decay time upon polarized photo&#8208;pumping, which are explained by a phenomenological model of the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions. Moreover, the chiroptical signal is switchable by reversing the direction of the pump pulse, demonstrating the versatile modulation of polarization selection in a single device. Our results offer fundamental insights into the helicity&#8208;resolved optical transitions in photoexcited chiral plasmonics and could facilitate the development of high&#8208;speed polarization&#8208;sensitive flat optics with potential applications in nanophotonics and quantum optics.)

         <title>Liquid Crystal Elastomer &#8211; Liquid Metal Composite: Ultrafast, Untethered, And Programmable Actuation by Induction Heating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liquid crystal elastomers (LCEs) are a class of stimuli&#8208;responsive materials that have been intensively studied for applications including artificial muscles, shape morphing structures, and soft robotics, due to their capability of large, programmable, and fully reversible actuation strains. To fully take advantage of LCEs, rapid, untethered, and programmable actuation methods are highly desirable. Here, we report a liquid crystal elastomer&#8208;liquid metal (LCE&#8208;LM) composite, which enables ultrafast and programmable actuations by eddy current induction heating. The composite consists of LM sandwiched between two LCE layers printed via direct ink writing (DIW). When subjected to a high&#8208;frequency alternating magnetic field, the composite is actuated in milliseconds. By moving the magnetic field, the eddy current is spatially controlled for selective actuation. Additionally, sequential actuation is achievable by programming the LM thickness distribution in a sample. With these capabilities, the LCE&#8208;LM composite is further exploited for multimodal deformation of a pop&#8208;up structure, on&#8208;ground omnidirectional robotic motion, and in&#8208;water targeted object manipulation and crawling.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Anchored Curved Carbon Surface for Efficient CO2 Electro&#8208;Reduction with Nearly 100% CO Selectivity and Industrially&#8208;Relevant Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Density functional theory calculations reveal that the Ni&#8208;N4 sites on curved carbon surfaces possess a lower energy barrier for *COOH formation, which benefits the CO2 reduction reaction. Accordingly, porous carbon with atomic Ni&#8208;N4 sites and a rich curved surface is developed and exhibits nearly 100 % selectivity for CO formation under a high current density of 400 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Although single metal atoms on porous carbons (PCs) are widely used in electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction, these systems have long relied on flat graphene&#8208;based models, which are far beyond reality because of abundant curved structures in PCs; the effect of curved surfaces has long been ignored. In addition, the selectivity generally decreases under high current density, which severely limits practical application. Herein, theoretical calculations reveal that a single&#8208;Ni&#8208;atom on a curved surface can simultaneously enhance the total density of states around Fermi level and decrease the energy barrier for *COOH formation, thereby enhancing catalytic activity. This work reports a rational molten salt approach for preparing PCs with ultra&#8208;high specific surface area of up to 2635 m2 g&#8722;1. As determined by cutting&#8208;edge techniques, a single Ni atom on a curved carbon surface is obtained and used as a catalyst for electrochemical CO2 reduction. The CO selectivity reaches up to 99.8% under industrial&#8208;level current density of 400&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PC&#8208;based catalysts. This work not only offers a new method for the rational synthesis of single atom catalysts with strained geometry to host rich active sites, but also provides in&#8208;depth insights for the origin of catalytic activity of curved structure&#8208;enriched PC&#8208;based catalysts.

         <title>Photostable Cascade&#8208;Activatable Peptide Self&#8208;Assembly on a Cancer Cell Membrane for High&#8208;Performance Identification of Human Bladder Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system can construct a polypeptide&#8208;based nanofiber structure in situ on a cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term stable imaging of bladder cancer. The targeted peptide can specifically react with the reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) to form TRAP, which exhibits enhanced hydrophobicity simultaneously aggregating into nanofibers. The nanofibers can achieve accurate tumor recognition and enable high&#8208;performance stable imaging, retaining the high signal/noise ratio.








Abstract
Missed or residual tumor burden results in high risk for bladder cancer relapse. However, existing fluorescent probes cannot meet the clinical needs because of inevitable photobleaching properties. Performance can be improved by maintaining intensive and sustained fluorescence signals via resistance to intraoperative saline flushing and intrinsic fluorescent decay, providing surgeons with sufficiently clear and high&#8208;contrast surgical fields, avoiding residual tumors or missed diagnosis. This study designs and synthesizes a photostable cascade&#8208;activatable peptide, a target reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (TRAP) system, which can construct polypeptide&#8208;based nanofibers in situ on the cell membrane to achieve long&#8208;term and stable imaging of bladder cancer. The probe has two parts: a target peptide (TP) targets CD44v6 to recognize bladder cancer cells, and a reaction&#8208;induced aggregation peptide (RAP) is introduced, which effectively reacts with the TP via a click reaction to enhance the hydrophobicity of the whole molecule, assembling into nanofibers and further nanonetworks. Accordingly, probe retention on the cell membrane is prolonged, and photostability is significantly improved. Finally, the TRAP system is successfully employed in the high&#8208;performance identification of human bladder cancer in ex vivo bladder tumor tissues. This cascade&#8208;activatable peptide molecular probe based on the TRAP system enables efficient and stable imaging of bladder cancer.

         <title>A Computationally Assisted Approach for Designing Wearable Biosensors toward Non&#8208;Invasive Personalized Molecular Analysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An automated computational framework named QuantumDock is developed for universal molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) development toward a variety of wearable biosensing applications. QuantumDock employs molecular docking and density functional theory to probe the molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules, optimizing the selectivity of the MIP biosensor for the wearable analysis of a wide range of biomarkers. (e.g., phenylalanine).








Abstract
Wearable sweat sensors have the potential to revolutionize precision medicine as they can non&#8208;invasively collect molecular information closely associated with an individual's health status. However, the majority of clinically relevant biomarkers cannot be continuously detected in situ using existing wearable approaches. Molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) are a promising candidate to address this challenge but haven't yet gained widespread use due to their complex design and optimization process yielding variable selectivity. Here, QuantumDock is introduced, an automated computational framework for universal MIP development toward wearable applications. QuantumDock utilizes density functional theory to probe molecular interactions between monomers and the target/interferent molecules to optimize selectivity, a fundamentally limiting factor for MIP development toward wearable sensing. A molecular docking approach is employed to explore a wide range of known and unknown monomers, and to identify the optimal monomer/cross&#8208;linker choice for subsequent MIP fabrication. Using an essential amino acid phenylalanine as the exemplar, experimental validation of QuantumDock is performed successfully using solution&#8208;synthesized MIP nanoparticles coupled with ultraviolet&#8211;visible spectroscopy. Moreover, a QuantumDock&#8208;optimized graphene&#8208;based wearable device is designed that can perform autonomous sweat induction, sampling, and sensing. For the first time, wearable non&#8208;invasive phenylalanine monitoring is demonstrated in human subjects toward personalized healthcare applications.

         <title>Electrochemical Doping in Ordered and Disordered Domains of Organic Mixed Ionic&#8211;Electronic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel organic bioelectronic technologies rely on the efficient electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers. In this work, it is investigated how the doping process can be controlled by the co&#8208;existence of ordered and disordered domains in polymeric films. It is shown that both domains are doped trough different mechanisms and extents, and that optimal conductivity can be achieved by modulating film order.








Abstract
Conjugated polymers are increasingly used as organic mixed ionic&#8211;electronic conductors in electrochemical applications for neuromorphic computing, bioelectronics, and energy harvesting. The design of efficient electrochemical devices relies on large modulations of the polymer conductivity, fast doping/dedoping kinetics, and high ionic uptake. In this work, structure&#8211;property relations are established and control of these parameters by the co&#8208;existence of order and disorder in the phase morphology is demonstrated. Using in&#160;situ time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, resonant Raman, and terahertz (THz) conductivity measurements, the electrochemical doping in the different morphological domains of poly(3&#8208;hexylthiophene) (P3HT) is investigated. The main finding is that bipolarons are found preferentially in disordered polymer regions, where they are formed faster and are thermodynamically more favored. On the other hand, polarons show a preference for ordered domains, leading to drastically different bipolaron/polaron ratios and doping/dedoping dynamics in the distinct regions. A significant enhancement of the electronic conductivity is evident when bipolarons start forming in the disordered regions, while the presence of bipolarons in the ordered regions is detrimental for transport. This study provides significant advances in the understanding of the impact of morphology on the electrochemical doping of conjugated polymers and the induced increase in conductivity.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials.

&lt;p&gt;Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross-linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage-like tissue formation within the hydrogel.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load-bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self-assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene-1,3,5-tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self-assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross-linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra- and interfiber cross-links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear-thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross-linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom-up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tumor Eradication by Boron Neutron Capture Therapy with 10B&#8208;enriched Hexagonal Boron Nitride Nanoparticles Grafted with Poly(Glycerol)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sub&#8208;10&#160;nm 10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG) are developed as a boron nanocarrier for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT). Benefiting from the small particle size and high stealth efficiency, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles efficiently accumulate in CT26 tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1, resulting in significant tumor shrinkage by BNCT alone.








Abstract
Boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) has emerged as a treatment modality with high precision and efficacy of intractable tumors. At the core of effective tumor BNCT are 10B carriers with facile preparation as well as advantageous pharmacokinetic and therapeutic profiles. Herein, the design and preparation of sub&#8208;10 nm&#160;10B&#8208;enriched hexagonal boron nitride nanoparticles grafted with poly(glycerol) (h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG), and their application to cancer treatment by BNCT are reported. By virtue of their small particle size and outstanding stealth property, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles accumulate efficiently in murine CT26 colon tumors with a high intratumor 10B concentration of 8.8%ID&#160;g&#8722;1 or 102.1&#160;&#181;g&#160;g&#8722;1 at 12&#160;h post&#8208;injection. Moreover, h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles penetrate into the inside of the tumor parenchyma and then are taken up by the tumor cells. BNCT comprising a single bolus injection of h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles and subsequent one&#8208;time neutron irradiation results in significant shrinkage of subcutaneous CT26 tumors. h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG&#8208;mediated BNCT not only causes direct DNA damage to the tumor cells, but also triggers pronounced inflammatory immune response in the tumor tissues, which contributes to long&#8208;lasting tumor suppression after the neutron irradiation. Thus, the h&#8208;10BN&#8208;PG nanoparticles are promising BNCT agents to eradicate tumor through highly efficient 10B accumulation.

         <title>Multistable Metafluid based Energy Harvesting and Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes a novel approach to energy harvesting, storage, and on&#8208;demand release by integrating compressible gas within a multistable structure. An analytical and experimental investigation is carried out into this &#8220;metafluid.&#8221; We&#160;examine its potential for energy harvesting from temperature fluctuations (such as day and night cycles), store the energy internally, and convert it into mechanical energy when needed.








Abstract
The thermodynamic properties of fluids play a crucial role in many engineering applications, particularly in the context of energy. Fluids with multistable thermodynamic properties may offer new paths for harvesting and storing energy via transitions between equilibria states. Such artificial multistable fluids can be created using the approach employed in metamaterials, which controls macro&#8208;properties through micro&#8208;structure composition. In this work, the dynamics of such &#8220;metafluids&#8221; is examined for a configuration of calorically&#8208;perfect compressible gas contained within multistable elastic capsules flowing in a fluid&#8208;filled tube. The velocity&#8208;, pressure&#8208;, and temperature&#8208;fields of multistable compressible metafluids is studied by both analytically and experimentally, focusing on transitions between different equilibria. The dynamics of a single capsule is first examine, which may move or change equilibrium state, due to fluidic forces. The interaction and motion of multiple capsules within a fluid&#8208;filled tube is then studied. It shows that such a system can be used to harvest energy from external temperature variations in either time or space. Thus, fluidic multistability allows specific quanta of energy to be captured and stored indefinitely as well as transported as a fluid, via tubes, at standard atmospheric conditions without the need for thermal&#160;isolation.

         <title>Nonlinear Inflatable Actuators for Distributed Control in Soft Robots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces conical shell actuators that display buckling instability when loaded with pressure. The critical peak&#8208; and valley&#8208;pressures are independently tunable through geometrical parameters. When these thresholds are carefully tuned for a system of actuators, a complex actuation sequence can be designed for, with only one input. This study demonstrates this by playing Beethoven on a piano.








Abstract
As soft robotic systems grow in complexity and functionality, the size and stiffness of the needed control hardware severely limits their application potential. Alternatively, functionality can be embodied within actuator characteristics, drastically reducing the amount of peripherals. Functions such as memory, computation, and energy storage then result from the intrinsic mechanical behavior of precisely designed structures. Here, actuators are introduced with tunable characteristics to generate complex actuation sequences from a single input. Intricate sequences are made possible by harnessing hysteron characteristics encoded in the buckling of a cone&#8208;shaped shell incorporated in the actuator design. A large variety of such characteristics are generated by varying the actuator geometry. This dependency is mapped and used for creating a tool to determine the actuator geometry that yields a desired characteristic. Using this tool, a system with six actuators is created that plays the final movement of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony with a single pressure supply.

         <title>Gate&#8208;Defined Josephson Weak&#8208;Links in Monolayer WTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Monolayer tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) can be both a quantum spin Hall insulator and gated into a superconducting state. Josephson weak&#8208;links are fabricated using local gates on hBN&#8208;encapsulated WTe2 and the 2D nature of the superconducting leads is demonstrated. The fabrication provides a first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one gate configurable topological Josephson weak&#8208;links.








Abstract
Systems combining superconductors with topological insulators offer a platform for the study of Majorana bound states and a possible route to realize fault tolerant topological quantum computation. Among the systems being considered in this field, monolayers of tungsten ditelluride (WTe2) have a rare combination of properties. Notably, it has been demonstrated to be a quantum spin Hall insulator (QSHI) and can easily be gated into a superconducting state. Measurements on gate&#8208;defined Josephson weak&#8208;link devices fabricated using monolayer WTe2 are reported. It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all&#8208;in&#8208;one topological Josephson weak&#8208;links using monolayer WTe2.

It is found that consideration of the 2D superconducting leads are critical in the interpretation of magnetic interference in the resulting junctions. The reported fabrication procedures suggest a facile way to produce further devices from this technically challenging material and the results mark the first step toward realizing versatile all-in-one topological Josephson weak-links using monolayer WTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Additive Manufacturing of Thermoelectric Microdevices for 4D Thermometry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device is developed for direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale. The paradigm of a 3D&#8208;printed thermocouple micro&#8208;network provides new advantages to access microscopic thermodynamics without dimensional limit. In this study, microscale 4D temperature fields generated by Joule&#8208;heating or evaporative cooling are directly observed.








Abstract
Thermometry, the process of measuring temperature, is one of the most fundamental tasks not only for understanding the thermodynamics of basic physical, chemical, and biological processes but also for thermal management of microelectronics. However, it is a challenge to acquire microscale temperature fields in both space and time. Here, a 3D printed micro&#8208;thermoelectric device that enables direct 4D (3D Space + Time) thermometry at the microscale is reported. The device is composed of freestanding thermocouple probe networks, fabricated by bi&#8208;metal 3D printing with an outstanding spatial resolution of a few &#181;m. It shows that the developed 4D thermometry can explore dynamics of Joule heating or evaporative cooling on microscale subjects of interest such as a microelectrode or a water meniscus. The utilization of 3D printing further opens up the possibility to freely realize a wide range of on&#8208;chip, freestanding microsensors or microelectronic devices without the design restrictions by manufacturing processes.

         <title>Directed Neural Stem Cells Differentiation via Signal Communication with Ni&#8211;Zn Micromotors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotors precisely approach target neural stem cells (NSCs) under magnetic guidance and further activate the cellular voltage&#8208;gated ion channel, thus directing the differentiation fate of the target cell. Such micromotors provide a possibility for non&#8208;invasive, minimally invasive therapy for neuron regeneration.








Abstract
Neural stem cells (NSCs), with the capability of self&#8208;renewal, differentiation, and environment modulation, are considered promising for stroke, brain injury therapy, and neuron regeneration. Activation of endogenous NSCs, is attracting increasing research enthusiasm, which avoids immune rejection and ethical issues of exogenous cell transplantation. Yet, how to induce directed growth and differentiation in situ remain a major challenge. In this study, a pure water&#8208;driven Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor via a self&#8208;established electric&#8211;chemical field is proposed. The micromotors can be magnetically guided and precisely approach target NSCs. Through the electric&#8211;chemical field, bioelectrical signal exchange and communication with endogenous NSCs are allowed, thus allowing for regulated proliferation and directed neuron differentiation in vivo. Therefore, the Ni&#8211;Zn micromotor provides a platform for controlling cell fate via a self&#8208;established electrochemical field and targeted activation of endogenous NSCs.

         <title>Buckling Metamaterials for Extreme Vibration Damping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. It is shown that allowing buckling of the primary load path can be used to set an upper limit for vibration transmission. In free&#8208;standing mechanical metamaterials, this principle is used to generate extreme vibration damping with very high stiffness, far exceeding typical values for lightweight structural materials.








Abstract
Damping mechanical resonances is a formidable challenge in an increasing number of applications. Many passive damping methods rely on using low stiffness, complex mechanical structures or electrical systems, which render them unfeasible in many of these applications. Herein, a new method for passive vibration damping, by allowing buckling of the primary load path in mechanical metamaterials and lattice structures, is introduced, which sets an upper limit for vibration transmission: the transmitted&#160;acceleration saturates at a maximum value in both tension and compression, no matter what the input acceleration is. This nonlinear mechanism leads to an extreme damping coefficient tan&#948; &#8776; 0.23 in a metal metamaterial&#8212;orders of magnitude larger than the linear damping coefficient of traditional lightweight structural materials. This principle is demonstrated experimentally and numerically in free&#8208;standing rubber and metal mechanical metamaterials over a range of accelerations. It is also shown that damping nonlinearities even allow buckling&#8208;based vibration damping to work in tension, and that bidirectional buckling can further improve its performance. Buckling metamaterials pave the way toward extreme vibration damping without mass or stiffness penalty, and, as such, could be applicable in a multitude of high&#8208;tech applications, including aerospace, vehicles, and sensitive&#160;instruments.

         <title>Delocalized Electronic Engineering of Ni5P4 Nanoroses for Durable Li&#8211;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nitrogen heteroatoms are introduced to effectively induce electron delocalization and construction of strong electronegative centers of nickel phosphide, significantly decreasing the energy barrier for efficient oxygen reduction reaction/oxygen evolution reaction in Li&#8211;O2 batteries.








Abstract
The sluggish kinetics and issues associated with the parasitic reactions of cathodes are major obstacles to the large&#8208;scale application of Li&#8211;O2 batteries (LOBs), despite their large theoretical energy density. Therefore, efficient electrocatalyst design is critical for optimizing their performance. Ni5P4 is analyzed theoretically as a cathode material, and the downshift of the d&#8208;band center is found to enhance electron occupation in antibonding orbits, providing a valuable descriptor for understanding and enhancing the intrinsic electrocatalytic activity. In this study, it is demonstrated that incorporating additional nitrogen atoms into Ni5P4 nanoroses regulates the electronic structure, resulting in superior electrocatalytic performance in LOBs. Further spectroscopic analysis and density functional theory calculations reveal that the incorporated nitrogen sites can effectively induce localized structure polarization, lowering the energy barrier for the production of desirable intermediates and thus enhancing battery capacity and preventing cell degradation. This approach provides a sound basis for developing advanced electrode materials with optimized electronic structures for high&#8208;performance LOBs.

         <title>A Gas/phototheranostic Nanocomposite Integrates NIR&#8208;II&#8208;Peak Absorbing Aza&#8208;BODIPY with Thermal&#8208;Sensitive Nitric Oxide Donor for Atraumatic Osteosarcoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY), combining with a thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.








Abstract
Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high&#8208;energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020&#8208;NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near&#8208;infrared&#8208;peak (NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak) absorbing aza&#8208;boron&#8208;dipyrromethenes (aza&#8208;BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal&#8208;sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (S&#8208;nitroso&#8208;N&#8208;acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR&#8208;II&#8208;peak absorbance (&#955;max = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep&#8208;tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR&#8208;II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low&#8208;temperature PTT for osteosarcoma.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, an enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is engineered to obtain the second near-infrared-peak (NIR-II-peak) absorbing aza-boron-dipyrromethenes (aza-BODIPY), combining with a thermal-sensitive nitric oxide donor to form a gas/phototheranostics. This gas/phototheranostics that combines gas therapy with low-temperature photothermal therapy executes the therapeutic mechanism of enhanced cell apoptosis for osteosarcoma, simultaneously, achieving an atraumatic therapeutic process.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Photothermal therapy (PTT) has received increasing interest in cancer therapeutics owing to its excellent efficacy and controllability. However, there are two major limitations in PTT applications, which are the tissue penetration depth of lasers within the absorption range of photothermal agents and the unavoidable tissue empyrosis induced by high-energy lasers. Herein, a gas/phototheranostic nanocomposite (NA1020-NO@PLX) is engineered that integrates the second near-infrared-peak (NIR-II-peak) absorbing aza-boron-dipyrromethenes (aza-BODIPY,NA1020) with the thermal-sensitive nitric oxide (NO) donor (&lt;i&gt;S&lt;/i&gt;-nitroso-&lt;i&gt;N&lt;/i&gt;-acetylpenicillamine, SNAP). An enhanced intramolecular charge transfer mechanism is proposed to achieve the NIR-II-peak absorbance (&lt;i&gt;&#955;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = 1020&#160;nm) on NA1020, thereby obtaining its deep tissue penetration depth. The NA1020 exhibits a remarkable photothermal conversion, making it feasible for the deep-tissue orthotopic osteosarcoma therapy and providing favorable NIR-II emission to precisely pinpoint the tumor for a visible PTT process. The simultaneously investigated atraumatic therapeutic process with an enhanced cell apoptosis mechanism indicates the feasibility of the synergistic NO/low-temperature PTT for osteosarcoma. Herein, this gas/phototheranostic strategy optimizes the existing PTT to present a repeatable and atraumatic photothermal therapeutic process for deep-tissue tumors, validating its potential clinical applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature, Reversible, and Robust Thermochromic Fluorescence Based on Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 for Anti&#8208;Counterfeiting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are demonstrated in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals. Such unique features showcase a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption application.








Abstract
Thermochromic fluorescent materials (TFMs) characterized by noticeable emission color variation with temperature have attracted pervasive attention for their frontier application in stimulus&#8208;response and optical encryption technologies. However, existing TFMs typically suffer from weak PL reversibility as well as limited mild operating temperature and severe temperature PL quenching. PL switching under extreme conditions such as high temperature will undoubtedly improve encryption security, while it is still challenging for present TFMs. In this work, high&#8208;temperature thermochromic fluorescence up to 473 K and robust structural and optical reversibility of 80 cycles are observed in Rb2MnBr4(H2O)2 and related crystals, which is seldom reported for PL changes at such a high temperature. Temperature&#8208;driven nonluminous, red and green light emission states can be achieved at specific temperatures and the modulation mechanism is verified by in situ optical and structural measurements and single particle transition. By virtue of this unique feature, a multicolor anti&#8208;counterfeiting label based on a broad temperature gradient and multidimensional information encryption applications are demonstrated. This work opens a window for the design of inorganic materials with multi&#8208;PL change and the development of advanced encryption strategies with extreme stimuli source.

         <title>All&#8208;Day Multicyclic Atmospheric Water Harvesting Enabled by Polyelectrolyte Hydrogel with Hybrid Desorption Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with free and coordinated hygroscopic salt is described, which exhibits fast sorption due to the large interior osmotic pressure and prevention of salt aggregation and leakage through the strong salt&#8211;polymer electrostatic interactions. By using a multicyclic operation strategy and a hybrid desorption mode, the sorbent achieves high&#8208;yield water production, outperforming single&#8208;cyclic solar&#8208;driven mode by three times.








Abstract
Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (AWH) is a promising approach for mitigating worldwide water scarcity. However, reliable water supply driven by sustainable energy regardless of diurnal variation and weather remains a long&#8208;standing challenge. To address this issue, a polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent with an optimal hybrid&#8208;desorption multicyclic&#8208;operation strategy is proposed, achieving all&#8208;day AWH and a significant increase in daily water production. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel possesses a large interior osmotic pressure of 659 atm, which refreshes sorption sites by continuously migrating the sorbed water within its interior, and thus enhancing sorption kinetics. The charged polymeric chains coordinate with hygroscopic salt ions, anchoring the salts and preventing agglomeration and leakage, thereby enhancing cyclic stability. The hybrid desorption mode, which couples solar energy and simulated waste heat, introduces a uniform and adjustable sorbent temperature for achieving all&#8208;day ultrafast water release. With rapid sorption&#8211;desorption kinetics, an optimization model suggests that eight moisture capture&#8211;release cycles are capable of achieving&#160;high water yield of 2410 mLwater kgsorbent&#8722;1 day&#8722;1, up to 3.5 times that of single&#8208;cyclic non&#8208;hybrid modes. The polyelectrolyte hydrogel sorbent and the coupling with sustainable energy driven desorption mode pave the way for the next&#8208;generation AWH systems, significantly bringing freshwater on a multi&#8208;kilogram scale closer.

         <title>Visualizing Interfacial Energy Offset and Defects in Efficient 2D/3D Heterojunction Perovskite Solar Cells and Modules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The effects of energy offset and defects with different halide types in 2D perovskite are studied, providing a new approach for designing stable and efficient PSCs. Using 2D/3D perovskite heterojunctions can improve the passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction, boosting the efficiency to 25.32% for the small devices and 21.48% for the large module.








Abstract
Currently, the full potential of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is limited by chargecarrier recombination owing to imperfect passivation methods. Here, the recombination loss mechanisms owing to the interfacial energy offset and defects are quantified. The results show that a favorable energy offset can reduce minority carriers and suppress interfacial recombination losses more effectively than chemical passivation. To obtain high&#8208;efficiency PSCs, 2D perovskites are promising candidates, which offer powerful field effects and require only modest chemical passivation at the interface. The enhanced passivation and charge&#8208;carrier extraction offered by the 2D/3D heterojunction PSCs has boosted their power conversion efficiency to 25.32% (certified 25.04%) for small&#8208;size devices and to 21.48% for a large&#8208;area module (with a designated area of 29.0&#160;cm2). Ion migration is also suppressed by the 2D/3D heterojunction, such that the unencapsulated small&#8208;size devices maintain 90% of their initial efficiency after 2000&#160;h of continuous operation at the maximum power point.

         <title>Paintable Physical Unclonable Functions using DNA</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
DNA liquid crystals (LCs), which are extracted from nature, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, are used as a paint for anti&#8208;counterfeiting labels. The entropy&#8208;driven instability in the evaporation process of DNA LCs induces a stochastic birefringent pattern that provides high&#8208;level security codes based on physical unclonable functions. The platform can allow the fabrication&#160;of protective barriers with a simple method, brushstrokes.








Abstract
Controversy over artwork's authenticity is ongoing despite numerous technologies for copyright protection. Artists should build their own ways to protect the authority, but these are still open to piracy. Here, a platform is proposed for developing anticounterfeiting labels based on physical unclonable functions (PUFs), in an artist&#8208;friendly manner, brushstrokes. Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), which is natural, biocompatible, and eco&#8208;friendly, can be applied as a paint that shows entropy&#8208;driven buckling instability of the liquid crystal phase. Brushed and wholly dried DNA exhibits line&#8208;shaped zig&#8208;zag textures with inherent randomness as a source of the PUF, and its primary performance and reliability are systematically examined. This breakthrough enables the utilization of these drawings in a wider range of applications.

         <title>An Artificial Olfactory System Based on a Chemi&#8208;Memristive Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hysteretic chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor containing TiO2&#8208;nanorod memristors based on oxygen vacancy dynamics different from that of conventional sensors is developed. Analog conductance modulation based on the redox reaction with external gas molecules in a ruptured filament area after memristive switching converts external gas stimuli into synaptic weights to realize an artificial olfactory system.








Abstract
Technologies based on the fusion of gas sensors and neuromorphic computing to mimic the olfactory system have immense potential. However, the implementation of neuromorphic olfactory systems remains in a state of infancy because conventional gas sensors lack the necessary functions. Therefore, this study proposes a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. After the memristive switching operation, the redox reaction with the external gas molecules is enhanced, resulting in the generation and elimination of oxygen vacancies that induce rapid current changes. In addition, the pre&#8208;generated oxygen vacancies enhance the post&#8208;sensing properties. Therefore, fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response are achieved by the proposed sensor at room temperature. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated as a potential application. Moreover, analog conductance modulation induced by oxidizing and reducing gases enables the conversion of external gas stimuli into synaptic weights and hence the realization of typical synaptic functionalities without an additional device or circuit. The proposed chemi&#8208;memristive device represents an advance in the bioinspired technology adopted in creating artificial intelligence systems.

         <title>Seeded Synthesis of Hollow PdSn Intermetallic Nanomaterials for Highly Efficient Electrocatalytic Glycerol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A seeded method is developed to prepare hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles, i.e., orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2, based on rational modulation of phase and morphology. The obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles with modified electronic structure, high intrinsic activity, and abundant active sites exhibit excellent catalytic performances toward electrochemical glycerol oxidation, outperforming hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 and solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn nanoparticles.








Abstract
Intermetallic nanomaterials have shown promising potential as high&#8208;performance catalysts in various catalytic reactions due to their unconventional crystal phases with ordered atomic arrangements. However, controlled synthesis of intermetallic nanomaterials with tunable crystal phases and unique hollow morphologies remains a challenge. Here, a seeded method is developed to synthesize hollow PdSn intermetallic nanoparticles (NPs) with two different intermetallic phases, that is, orthorhombic Pd2Sn and monoclinic Pd3Sn2. Benefiting from the rational regulation of the crystal phase and morphology, the obtained hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs deliver excellent electrocatalytic performance toward glycerol oxidation reaction (GOR), outperforming solid orthorhombic Pd2Sn NPs, hollow monoclinic Pd3Sn2 NPs, and commercial Pd/C, which places it among the best reported Pd&#8208;based GOR electrocatalysts. The reaction mechanism of GOR using the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn as the catalyst is investigated by operando infrared reflection absorption spectroscopy, which reveals that the hollow orthorhombic Pd2Sn catalyst cleaves the C&#63743;C bond more easily compared to the commercial Pd/C. This work can pave an appealing route to the controlled synthesis of diverse novel intermetallic nanomaterials with hollow morphology for various promising applications.

         <title>Large&#8208;Scale Molecular Dynamics Elucidates the Mechanics of Reinforcement in Graphene&#8208;Based Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The mechanism of reinforcement of polymer materials by graphene&#8208;based inclusions is highly important for the design of high&#8208;performance composites. Very large molecular simulations show that single graphene layers can effectively reinforce the polymer matrix via a shear&#8208;lag process down to flake sizes of 500 nm, as long as the flake is predominantly flat. However, even small undulations of the surface substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.








Abstract
Using very large&#8208;scale classical molecular dynamics, the mechanics of nano&#8208;reinforcement of graphene&#8208;based nanocomposites are &#160;examined. Simulations show that significant quantities of large, defect&#8208;free, and predominantly flat graphene flakes are required for successful enhancement of materials properties in excellent agreement with experimental and proposed continuum shear&#8208;lag theories. The critical lengths for enhancement are approximately 500 nm for graphene and 300 nm and for graphene oxide (GO). The reduction of Young's modulus in GO results in a much smaller enhancement of the composite's Young's modulus. The simulations reveal that the flakes should be aligned and planar for optimal reinforcement. Undulations substantially degrade the enhancement of materials properties.

         <title>Polyimides Physically Crosslinked by Aromatic Molecules Exhibit Ultrahigh Energy Density at 200&#160;&#176;C</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost breakdown strength and trap charge carriers to suppress dielectric loss. An ultrahigh Ud of 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and superior cyclic stability at 200&#160;&#176;C are achieved in the all&#8208;organic composites.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics possess significant advantages in electrostatic energy storage applications, such as high breakdown strength (Eb) and efficiency (&#951;), while their discharged energy density (Ud) at high temperature is limited by the decrease in Eb and &#951;. Several strategies including introducing inorganic components and crosslinking have been investigated to improve the Ud of polymer dielectrics, but new issues will be encountered, e.g., the sacrifice of flexibility, the degradation of the interfacial insulating property and the complex preparation process. In this work, 3D rigid aromatic molecules are introduced into aromatic polyimides to form physical crosslinking networks through electrostatic interactions between their oppositely charged phenyl groups. The dense physical crosslinking networks strengthen the polyimides to boost the Eb, and the aromatic molecules trap the charge carriers to suppress the loss, allowing the strategy to combine the advantages of inorganic incorporation and crosslinking. This study demonstrates that this strategy is well applicable to a number of representative aromatic polyimides, and ultrahigh Ud of 8.05&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (150&#160;&#176;C) and 5.12&#160;J&#160;cm&#8722;3 (200&#160;&#176;C) is achieved. Furthermore, the all&#8208;organic composites exhibit stable performances during ultralong 105 charge&#8211;discharge cycles in harsh environments (500&#160;MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 200&#160;&#176;C) and prospects for large&#8208;scale preparation.

Synthesis of multicomponent core&#8211;shell structures presents a versatile route to produce bifunctional molybdenum&#8208;based single&#8208;atom&#8208;catalysts. Zinc&#8211;air batteries with such multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, significantly outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks.








Abstract
Bifunctional catalysts can facilitate two different electrochemical reactions with conflicting characteristics. Here, a highly reversible bifunctional electrocatalyst for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) is reported featuring a &#8220;core&#8211;shell structure&#8221; in which N&#8208;doped graphene sheets wrap around vanadium molybdenum oxynitride nanoparticles. Single Mo atoms are released from the particle core during synthesis and anchored to electronegative N&#8208;dopant species in the graphitic shell. The resultant Mo single&#8208;atom catalysts excel as active oxygen evolution reaction (OER) sites in pyrrolic&#8208;N and as active oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) sites in pyridinic&#8208;N environments. ZABs with such bifunctional and multicomponent single&#8208;atom catalysts deliver high power density (&#8776;376.4&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) and long cycle life of over 630&#160;h, outperforming noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based benchmarks. Flexible ZABs that can tolerate a wide range of temperatures (&#8722;20 to 80&#160;&#176;C) under severe mechanical deformation are also demonstrated

         <title>An Ultrafast, Energy&#8208;Efficient Electrochromic and Thermochromic Device for Smart Windows</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through innovative molecular design and advanced device optimization, a high&#8208;performance electrochromic device is achieved, demonstrating high transparency, rapid color&#8208;switching, and excellent stability. In conjunction with the creation of a thermoresponsive gel electrolyte, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is realized, exhibiting flame&#8208;retardant properties and energy&#8208;saving characteristics. Such an advanced device equips smart windows with energy efficiency, privacy protection, and decorative enhancements.








Abstract
Smart windows nowadays undertake the esteemed obligation of reducing energy consumption as well as upgrading living experience. This project aims to devise a smart window that responds to both electricity and heat, with the intention of achieving energy efficiency, privacy preservation, and enhanced decorative attributes. Through the implementation of a novel electrochromic material design, coupled with the optimization of electrochromic devices (ECDs), a high&#8208;performance ECD is obtained, demonstrating coloring/bleaching time of 0.53/0.16&#160;s, a transmittance modulation of 78% (from 99% to 21%), and superior performance in six dimensions. Furthermore, temperature&#8208;responsive units and an ionic liquid are incorporated into the electrolyte system to create a novel thermochromic gel electrolyte with transmittance modulation from 80% to 0%, and excellent thermal insulation (6.4&#160;&#176;C reduction). Ultimately, an electro&#8208; and thermochromic device is developed, featuring an ultrafast color&#8208;switching speed of 0.82/0.60&#160;s and multiple working modes. Overall, this work showcases a prospective design pathway for the development of next&#8208;generation ultrafast&#8208;switching, and energy&#8208;efficient intelligent windows.

         <title>Constructing Oxygen&#8208;Related Defects in Carbon Nanodots with Janus Optical Properties: Noninvasive NIR Fluorescent Imaging and Effective Photocatalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Oxygen&#8208;related defects with unpaired electrons are constructed in carbon dots via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid, which not only contribute to the enhanced near&#8208;infrared (NIR) bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to noninvasive NIR fluorescent imaging and effective photocatalytic therapy.








Abstract
Noninvasive fluorescence (FL) imaging and high&#8208;performance photocatalytic therapy (PCT) are opposing optical properties that are difficult to combine in a single material system. Herein, a facile approach to introducing oxygen&#8208;related defects in carbon dots (CDs) via post&#8208;oxidation with 2&#8208;iodoxybenzoic acid is reported, in which some nitrogen atoms are substituted by oxygen atoms. Unpaired electrons in these oxygen&#8208;related defects rearrange the electronic structure of the oxidized CDs (ox&#8208;CDs), resulting in an emerging near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption band. These defects not only contribute to enhanced NIR bandgap emission but also act as trappers for photoexcited electrons to promote efficient charge separation on the surface, leading to abundant photo&#8208;generated holes on the ox&#8208;CDs surface under visible&#8208;light irradiation. Under white LED torch irradiation, the photo&#8208;generated holes oxidize hydroxide to hydroxyl radicals in the acidification of the aqueous solution. In contrast, no hydroxyl radicals are detected in the ox&#8208;CDs aqueous solution under 730&#160;nm laser irradiation, indicating noninvasive NIR FL imaging potential. Utilizing the Janus optical properties of the ox&#8208;CDs, the in vivo NIR FL imaging of sentinel lymph nodes around tumors and efficient photothermal enhanced tumor PCT are demonstrated.

         <title>Multifunctional Flexible Sensor Based on PU&#8208;TA@MXene Janus Architecture for Selective Direction Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the asymmetric structural features and functions of finger skin, an innovative PU&#8208;TA@MXene sensing film with bionic Janus architecture is proposed by a simple but ingenious gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly strategy, and the derived flexible sensor reveals strong mechanical properties, self&#8208;healing ability, and well&#8208;selective response behavior to normal pressure, stretching, and directional bending.








Abstract
Multifunctional selectivity and mechanical properties are always a focus of attention in the field of flexible sensors. In particular, the construction of biomimetic architecture for sensing materials can endow the fabricated sensors with intrinsic response features and extra&#8208;derived functions. Here, inspired by the asymmetric structural features of human skin, a novel tannic acid (TA)&#8208;modified MXene&#8208;polyurethane film with a bionic Janus architecture is proposed, which is prepared by gravity&#8208;driven self&#8208;assembly for the gradient dispersion of 2D TA@MXene nanosheets into a PU network. This obtained film reveals strong mechanical properties of a superior elongation at a break of 2056.67% and an ultimate tensile strength of 50.78&#160;MPa with self&#8208;healing performance. Moreover, the Janus architecture can lead to a selective multifunctional response of flexible sensors to directional bending, pressure, and stretching. Combined with a machine learning module, the sensor is endowed with high recognition rates for force detection (96.1%). Meanwhile, direction identification in rescue operations and human movement monitoring can be realized by this sensor. This work offers essential research value and practical significance for the material structures, mechanical properties, and application platforms of flexible sensors.

         <title>Thin&#8208;Film Organic Heteroepitaxy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems have not been fully clarified. In this work, one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate heteroepitaxy is demonstrated and it is shown that the lattice matched plane of the adcrystal must also be its lowest energy surface.








Abstract
Incorporating crystalline organic semiconductors into electronic devices requires understanding of heteroepitaxy given the ubiquity of heterojunctions in these devices. However, while rules for commensurate epitaxy of covalent or ionic inorganic material systems are known to be dictated by lattice matching constraints, rules for heteroepitaxy of molecular systems are still being written. Here, it is found that lattice matching alone is insufficient to achieve heteroepitaxy in molecular systems, owing to weak intermolecular forces that describe molecular crystals. It is found that, in addition, the lattice matched plane also must be the lowest energy surface of the adcrystal to achieve one&#8208;to&#8208;one commensurate molecular heteroepitaxy over a large area. Ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrates the lattice matched interface to be of higher electronic quality than a disordered interface of the same materials.

         <title>Mechano&#8208;Electrochemically Promoting Lithium Atom Diffusion and Relieving Accumulative Stress for Deep&#8208;Cycling Lithium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tensile stress can be incorporated into lithium metal anodes to reduce lithium atom diffusion energy barrier by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium through copolymer thinning. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8208;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation.








Abstract
Lithium metal batteries (LMBs) can double the energy density of lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the notorious lithium dendrite growth and large volume change are not well addressed, especially under deep cycling. Here, an in&#8211;situ mechanical&#8211;electrochemical coupling system is built, and it is found that tensile stress can induce smooth lithium deposition. Density functional theory (DFT) calculation and finite element method (FEM) simulation confirm that the lithium atom diffusion energy barrier can be reduced when the lithium foils are under tensile strain. Then tensile stress is incorporated into lithium metal anodes by designing an adhesive copolymer layer attached to lithium in which the copolymer thinning can yield tensile stress to the lithium foil. Elastic lithium metal anode (ELMA) is further prepared via introducing a 3D elastic conductive polyurethane (CPU) host for the copolymer&#8211;lithium bilayer to release accumulated internal stresses and resist volume variation. The ELMA can withstand hundreds of compression&#8208;release cycles under 10% strain. LMBs paired with ELMA and LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811) cathode can operate beyond 250 cycles with 80% capacity retention under practical condition of 4 mAh cm&#8722;2 cathode capacity, 2.86&#160;g Ah&#8722;1 electrolyte&#8208;to&#8208;capacity ratio (E/C) and 1.8 negative&#8208;to&#8208;cathode capacity ratio (N/P), five times of the lifetime using lithium foils.

         <title>Flexible Modulation of Cellular Activities with Cationic Photosensitizers: Insights of Alkyl Chain Length on Reactive Oxygen Species Antimicrobial Mechanisms</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) with berberine (BBR) cores with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed for different binding, localization, and photodynamic killing effects among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility.








Abstract
Cationic photosensitizers have good binding ability with negatively charged bacteria and fungi, exhibiting broad applications potential in antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDT). However, cationic photosensitizers often display unsatisfactory transkingdom selectivity between mammalian cells and pathogens, especially for eukaryotic fungi. It is unclear which biomolecular sites are more efficient for photodynamic damage, owing to the lack of systematic research with the same photosensitizer system. Herein, a series of cationic aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) derivatives (CABs) (using berberine (BBR) as the photosensitizers core) with different length alkyl chains are successfully designed and synthesized for flexible modulation of cellular activities. The BBR core can efficiently produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) and achieve high&#8208;performance aPDT . Through the precise regulation of alkyl chain length, different bindings, localizations, and photodynamic killing effects of CABs are achieved and investigated systematically among bacteria, fungi, and mammalian cells. It is found that intracellular active substances, not membranes, are more efficient damage sites of aPDT. Moderate length alkyl chains enable CABs to effectively kill Gram&#8208;negative bacteria and fungi with light, while still maintaining excellent mammalian cell and blood compatibility. This study is expected to provide systematic theoretical and strategic research guidance for the construction of high&#8208;performance cationic photosensitizers with good transkingdom selectivity.

         <title>Multienzyme&#8208;Mimicking LaCoO3 Nanotrigger for Programming Cancer&#8208;Cell Pyroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals are developed to trigger the generation of aberrant reactive oxygen species, release of La ions, and the activation of inflammasomes to induce pyroptosis&#8208;mediated cell death and inhibit metastasis during lung cancer.








Abstract
Pyroptosis, a distinct paradigm of programmed cell death, is an efficient strategy against cancer by overcoming resistance to apoptosis. In this study, LaCoO3 (LCO) lanthanide&#8208;based nanocrystals with multienzyme characteristics are rationally designed and engineered to trigger the generation of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the release of lanthanum ions, ultimately inducing lung cancer cell pyroptosis. The peroxidase&#8208; and oxidase&#8208;mimicking activities of LCO nanocrystals endow LCO with ROS production capacity in tumor tissues with an acidic pH and high hydrogen peroxide content. Concurrently, the LCO nanoenzyme exhibits catalase&#8208; and glutathione peroxidase&#8208;like activities, reversing the hypoxic microenvironment, destroying the activated antioxidant system of tumor cells, and amplifying the sensitivity of tumor cells to ROS. The use of ultrasound further accelerates the enzymatic kinetic rate. Most importantly, the La3+ ions released by LCO robustly destroy the lysosomal membrane, finally inducing canonical pyroptotic cell death, together with ROS. LCO&#8208;nanocrystal&#8208;triggered programmed cell pyroptosis amplifies the therapeutic effects both in vitro and in vivo, effectively restraining lung cancer growth and metastasis. This study paves a new avenue for the efficient treatment of lung cancer and metastasis through US&#8208;enhanced lanthanum&#8208;based nanoenzyme platforms and pyroptotic cell death.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Polarization Strategy for Enhanced Acidic Oxygen Evolution Activity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte is reported, wherein Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;enhanced OER activity.







Abstract
Spin&#8208;polarization is known as a promising way to promote the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER), since the intermediates and products endow spin&#8208;dependent behaviors, yet it is rarely reported for ferromagnetic catalysts toward acidic OER practically used in industry. Herein, the first spin&#8208;polarization&#8208;mediated strategy is reported to create a net ferromagnetic moment in antiferromagnetic RuO2 via dilute manganese (Mn2+) (S = 5/2) doping for enhancing OER activity in acidic electrolyte. Element&#8208;selective X&#8208;ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the ferromagnetic coupling between Mn and Ru ions, fulfilling the Goodenough&#8211;Kanamori rule. The ferromagnetism behavior at room temperature can be well interpreted by first principles calculations as the interaction between the Mn2+ impurity and Ru ions. Indeed, Mn&#8208;RuO2 nanoflakes exhibit a strongly magnetic field enhanced OER activity, with the lowest overpotential of 143&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cmgeo&#8722;2 and negligible activity decay in 480&#160;h stability (vs 200&#160;mV/195&#160;h without magnetic field) as known for magnetic effects in the literature. The intrinsic turnover frequency is also improved to reach 5.5 s&#8722;1 at 1.45 VRHE. This work highlights an important avenue of spin&#8208;engineering strategy for designing efficient acidic oxygen evolution catalysts.

         <title>Eye&#8208;Mimicked Neural Network Composed of Photosensitive Neural Spheroids with Human Opsin Proteins</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain mimicking model is designed with photosensitive neural spheroid and neural network. In the photosensitive neural spheroid, human opins such as rhodopsin and short&#8208;wavelength opsin are reacted by the specific wavelength of light with selective sensitivity. Photonic reaction result in the neural response, of which signal spread to other neurons through axons.








Abstract
An&#160;in vitro model, composed of the short&#8208;wavelength human opsins and rhodopsins, is created. Two types of photosensitive neural spheroids are transfected for selective reaction under bluish&#8208;purple and green lights. These are employed to two devices with intact neuron and neural&#8208;spheroid to study the interaction. By photostimulation, the photosensitive spheroid initiated photoactivation, and the signal generated from its body is transmitted to adjacent neural networks. Specifically, the signal traveled through the axon bundle in narrow gap from photosensitive spheroid to intact spheroid as an eye&#8208;to&#8208;brain model including optic nerve. The whole process with photosensitive spheroid is monitored by calcium ion detecting fluorescence images. The results of this study can be applied to examine vision restoration and novel photosensitive biological systems with spectral sensitivity.

         <title>Optical Fibers Embedded with As&#8208;Grown Carbon Nanotubes for Ultrahigh Nonlinear Optical Responses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Direct growth of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with narrow diameter distribution on the inner walls of photonic crystal fibers (PCFs) by a two&#8208;step chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is developed. By using the as&#8208;fabricated 3&#8208;cm&#8208;long CNT&#8208;fibers with desirable nanotube optical transitions, both third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been largely enhanced and mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser has been fabricated with a stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate.








Abstract
Photonic crystal fiber (PCF) embedded with functional materials has demonstrated diverse applications ranging from ultrafast lasers, optical communication to chemical sensors. Many efforts have been made to fabricating carbon nanotube (CNT) based optical fibers by ex situ transfer method; however, often suffer poor uniformity and coverage. Here, the direct growth of CNTs on the inner walls of PCFs by the chemical vapor deposition (CVD)&#160;method is reported. A two&#8208;step growth method is&#160;developed to control the narrow diameter distribution of CNTs to ensure desirable nanotube optical transitions. In the as&#8208;fabricated CNT&#8208; embedded fiber, third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG)&#160;has been enhanced by &#8776;15 times compared with flat CNT film on fused silica. A dual&#8208;wavelength all&#8208;fiber mode&#8208;locked ultrafast laser (&#8776;1561 and &#8776;1064&#160;nm) is further demonstrated by integrating the 1.36&#177;0.15&#160;nm&#8208;diameter CNTs into two kinds of photonic bandgap hollow core PCF&#160;(named HC&#8208;1550 and HC&#8208;1060) as saturable absorbers, using their S11 (&#8776;0.7&#160;eV) and S22 (&#8776;1.2&#160;eV) interband transition respectively. The fiber laser shows stable output of &#8776;10&#160;mW, &#8776;800 fs pulse width, and &#8776;71&#160;MHz repetition rate at 1561&#160;nm wavelength. These&#160;results can enable the large&#8208;scale applications of CNTs in PCF&#8208;based optical devices.

         <title>New Function of Metal&#8211;Organic Framework: Structurally Ordered Metal Promoter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A targeted post&#8208;modification strategy is developed to anchor dozen kinds of metal ions into metal&#8211;organic framework composites as structurally ordered metal promoters, which not only contributes to constructing ideal catalyst models for elucidating action mechanism of metal promoters during the catalytic process, but also provides a universal method to synthesize high&#8208;efficiency catalysts.








Abstract
The remarkable roles of metal promoters have been known for nearly a century, but it is still a challenge to find a suitable structure model to reveal the action mechanism behind metal promoters. Herein, a new function of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) is developed as an ideal model to construct structurally ordered metal promoters by a targeted post&#8208;modification strategy. MOFs as model not only favor clearing the real action mechanism behind metal promoters, but also can anchor one or multiple kinds of metal promoters especially noble metal promoters. Typically, the as&#8208;prepared Pd/bpy&#8208;UiO&#8208;Cu catalysts show high selectivity (&gt;99%) toward 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane in 4&#8208;nitrostyrene hydrogenation, mainly due to the enhanced interaction between Pd nanoparticles and MOF carriers induced by Cu promoters, thus inhibiting the hydrogenation of 4&#8208;nitrophenylethane. This strategy with flexibility and universality will open up a new route to synthesize efficient catalysts with structurally ordered metal promoters.

         <title>Magneto&#8208;Mechanical Bilayer Metamaterial with Global Area&#8208;Preserving Density Tunability for Acoustic Wave Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The presented 2D metamaterial consists of two layers that are actuated separately by a remotely applied magnetic field. This novel bilayer design strategy enables the adjustment of the area density while simultaneously preserving the overall dimensions. These designs can be further exploited in acoustic applications, including highly tunable bandgaps and waveguides.








Abstract
2D metamaterials have immense potential in acoustics, optics, and electromagnetic applications due to their unique properties and ability to conform to curved substrates. Active metamaterials have attracted significant research attention because of their on&#8208;demand tunable properties and performances through shape reconfigurations. 2D active metamaterials often achieve active properties through internal structural deformations, which lead to changes in overall dimensions. This demands corresponding alterations of the conforming substrate, or the metamaterial fails to provide complete area coverage, which can be a significant limitation for their practical applications. To date, achieving area&#8208;preserving active 2D metamaterials with distinct shape reconfigurations remains a prominent challenge. In this paper, magneto&#8208;mechanical bilayer metamaterials are presented that demonstrate area density tunability with area&#8208;preserving capability. The bilayer metamaterials consist of two arrays of magnetic soft materials with distinct magnetization distributions. Under a magnetic field, each layer behaves differently, which allows the metamaterial to reconfigure its shape into multiple modes and to significantly tune its area density without changing its overall dimensions. The area&#8208;preserving multimodal shape reconfigurations are further exploited as active acoustic wave regulators to tune bandgaps and wave propagations. The bilayer approach thus provides a new concept for the design of area&#8208;preserving active metamaterials for broader applications.

         <title>Induction of Tumor Ferroptosis&#8208;Dependent Immunity via an Injectable Attractive Pickering Emulsion Gel</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL&#8208;3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.








Abstract
The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water&#8208;in&#8208;oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)&#8208;RSL&#8208;3 (RSL&#8208;3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death&#8208;1 (PD&#8208;1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL&#8208;3&#160;and PD&#8208;1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low&#8208;immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL&#8208;3 + PD&#8208;1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single&#8208;cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.

&lt;p&gt;A water-in-oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver RSL-3, a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death-1 (PD-1)&#160;antibody, an immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water. RSL-3 + PD-1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells through cascade amplification and elicits antitumor immune responses via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells in tumors with low immunogenicity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The combination of ferroptosis inducers and immune checkpoint blockade can enhance antitumor effects. However, the efficacy in tumors with low immunogenicity requires further investigation. In this work, a water-in-oil Pickering emulsion gel is developed to deliver (1S, 3R)-RSL-3 (RSL-3), a ferroptosis inducer dissolved in iodized oil, and programmed death-1 (PD-1) antibody, the most commonly used immune checkpoint inhibitor dissolved in water, with optimal characteristics (RSL-3 + PD-1@gel). Tumor lipase degrades the continuous oil phase, which results in the slow release of RSL-3&#160;and PD-1&#160;antibody and a notable antitumor effect against low-immunogenic hepatocellular carcinoma and pancreatic cancer. Intriguingly, the RSL-3 + PD-1@gel induces ferroptosis of tumor cells, resulting in antitumor immune response via accumulation of helper T lymphocyte cells and cytotoxic T cells. Additionally, the single-cell sequence profiling analysis during tumor treatment reveals the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells together with strong antitumor immune response in ascites.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Magnetically&#8208;Responsive Circularly Polarized Phosphorescence and X&#8208;Ray Scintillation in Ultrarobust Mn(II)&#8211;Organic Helical Chains</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrarobust helical Mn(II)&#8208;organic polymers are developed to realize magnetically&#8208;responsive circularly polarized phosphorescence (CPP) with exceptionally high performance (&#934;PL&#160;=&#160;89%, glum&#160;=&#160;0.021) as well as triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity.&#160;We&#160;have disclosed that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPP for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPP signal noticeably.








Abstract
Over recent years, Mn(II)&#8208;organic materials showing circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) have attracted great interest because of their eco&#8208;friendliness, cheapness, and room temperature phosphorescence. Using the helicity design strategy, herein, chiral Mn(II)&#8208;organic helical polymers are constructed featuring long&#8208;lived circularly polarized phosphorescence with exceptionally high glum and &#934;PL magnitudes of 0.021% and 89%, respectively, while remaining ultrarobust toward humidity, temperature, and X&#8208;rays. Equally important, it is disclosed for the first time that the magnetic field has a remarkably high negative effect on CPL for Mn(II) materials, suppressing the CPL signal by 4.2&#8208;times at B&#8407;$\vec{B}$&#160;=&#160;1.6&#160;T. Using the designed materials, UV&#8208;pumped CPL light&#8208;emitting diodes are fabricated, demonstrating enhanced optical selectivity under right&#8208; and left&#8208;handed polarization conditions. On top of all this, the reported materials display bright triboluminescence and excellent X&#8208;ray scintillation activity with a perfectly linear X&#8208;ray dose rate response up to 174&#160;&#181;Gyair&#160;s&#8722;1. Overall, these observations significantly contribute to the CPL phenomenon for multi&#8208;spin compounds and promote the design of highly efficient and stable Mn(II)&#8208;based CPL emitters.

         <title>Sequential Molecule&#8208;Doped Hole Conductor to Achieve &gt;23% Perovskite Solar Cells with 3000&#8208;Hour Operational Stability</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Application of solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD hole transport layers (HTLs) is being held back by poor stability and unsatisfied scalability. Herein, a versatile molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping approach is developed to improve the spatial doping uniformity and fabricate all&#8208;evaporated HTL. The resultant devices achieve a record efficiency of 23.4%, and exhibit impressive stability both in ambient and working conditions.








Abstract
Although hole transport layers (HTLs) based on solution&#8208;processed doped Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD are extremely popular and effective for their remarkable performance in n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells (PSCs), their scalable application is still being held back by poor chemical stability and unsatisfied scalability. Essentially, the volatile components and hygroscopic nature of ionic salts often cause morphological deformation that deteriorate both device efficiency and stability. Herein, a simple and effective molecular implantation&#8208;assisted sequential doping (MISD) approach is strategically introduced to modulate spatial doping uniformity of organic films and fabricate all evaporated Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD layer in which phase&#8208;segregation free HTL is achieved accompanied with high molecular density, uniform doping composition, and superior optoelectronic characteristics. The resultant MISD&#8208;based devices attain a record power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 23.4%, which represents the highest reported value among all the PSCs with evaporated HTLs. Simultaneously, the unencapsulated devices realize considerably enhanced stability by maintaining over 90% of their initial PCEs in the air for 5200&#160;h and after working at maximum power point under illumination for 3000&#160;h. This method provides a facile way to fabricate robust and reliable HTLs toward developing efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Extracellular Vesicles&#8208;Derived Hybrid Nanoplatforms for Amplified CD47 Blockade&#8208;Based Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanoplatforms are designed by fusing M1 macrophage extracellular vesicles with drug&#8208;loaded liposomes and decorating them with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, which enables amplified CD47 blockade&#8208;based tumor immunotherapy through combinational treatment strategy.








Abstract
Immunomodulation of tumor&#8208;associated macrophages (TAMs) into tumor&#8208;inhibiting M1&#8208;like phenotype is a promising but challenging strategy. Cleverly, tumor cells overexpress CD47, a &#8220;don't eat me&#8221; signal that ligates with the signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRP&#945;) on macrophages to escape phagocytosis. Thus, effective re&#8208;education of TAMs into the &#8220;eat me&#8221; type and blocking the CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling play pivotal roles in tumor immunotherapy. Herein, it is reported that hybrid nanovesicles (hEL&#8208;RS17) derived from extracellular vesicles of M1 macrophages and decorated with RS17 peptide, an antitumor peptide that specifically binds to CD47 on tumor cells and blocks CD47&#8208;SIRP&#945; signaling, can actively target tumor cells and remodel TAM phenotypes. Consequently, more M1&#8208;like TAMs infiltrate into tumor tissue to phagocytize more tumor cells due to CD47 blockade. By further co&#8208;encapsulating chemotherapeutic agent shikonin, photosensitizer IR820, and immunomodulator polymetformin in hEL&#8208;RS17, an enhanced antitumor effect is obtained due to the combinational treatment modality and close synergy among each component. Upon laser irradiation, the designed SPI@hEL&#8208;RS17 nanoparticles exert potent antitumor efficacy against both 4T1 breast tumor and B16F10 melanoma models, which not only suppresses primary tumor growth but also inhibits lung metastasis and prevents tumor recurrence, exhibiting great potential in boosting CD47 blockade&#8208;based antitumor immunotherapy.

         <title>A Carbon Aerogel Lightweight Al Battery for Fast Storage of Fluctuating Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel lightweight Al battery is constructed using a dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and a high&#8208;loading integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF induce Al deposition. The zero&#8208;volume expansion of the GCAF results in better stability. A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.








Abstract
Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite&#8208;free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O&#8208;containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con&#8208;firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&#8722;2) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&#8722;1) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.

A CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery exhibits excellent charge&#8211;discharge performance toward fast storage of fluctuating electricity.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Al batteries have great potential for renewable energy storage owing to their low cost, high capacity, and safety. High energy density and adaptability to fluctuating electricity are major challenges. Here, a lightweight Al battery for fast storage of fluctuating energy is constructed based on a novel hierarchical porous dendrite-free carbon aerogel film (CAF) anode and an integrated graphite composite carbon aerogel film (GCAF) cathode. A new induced mechanism by the O-containing functional groups on the CAF anode is con-firmed for uniform Al deposition. The GCAF cathode possesses a higher mass utilization ratio due to the extremely high loading mass (9.5&#8211;10.0&#160;mg cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of graphite materials compared to conventional coated cathodes. Meanwhile, the volume expansion of the GCAF cathode is almost negligible, resulting in better cycling stability. The lightweight CAF&#8214;GCAF full battery can adapt well to large and fluctuating current densities owing to its hierarchical porous structure. A large discharge capacity (115.6 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) after 2000 cycles and a short charge time (7.0&#160;min) at a high current density are obtained. The construction strategy of lightweight Al batteries based on carbon aerogel electrodes can promote the breakthrough of high-energy-density Al batteries adapted to the fast storage of fluctuating renewable energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>How to Adequately Describe Full Range Intercalation&#8212;A Two&#8208;Sided Approach</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accurate description of the cell voltage of an intercalation electrode succeeds by applying defect thermodynamics near the ordered compositions. At large deviations thermodynamic interpolation (as indicated in the figure) or non&#8208;ideal statistics is required. Literature data on nanocrystalline LixFePO4 are reproduced where the entire range is realized, but other materials can be described analogously (i, n, v, and p stand for interstitial Li+, excess electrons, Li+ vacancies, electron holes; C&#948; denotes the chemical capacitance; electronic defects are not shown in the figure).








Abstract
One of the key challenges in battery research is to quantitatively describe the intercalation storage capacity as a function of the reversible cell voltage. The reason that such endeavors are not yet very successful, lies in the lack of an adequate charge carrier treatment. Using the most challenging example of nanocrystalline lithium iron phosphate, where the full range from FePO4 to LiFePO4 is accessible without miscibility gap, this study shows how a quantitative description of literature results can be achieved even for such a huge window. For this purpose, point&#8208;defect thermodynamics is applied and the problem is tackled from the two end&#8208;member sides including saturation effects. A first, rather heuristic treatment interpolates in&#8208;between using the safe thermodynamic criterion of local phase stability. Already this straightforward approach works very satisfactorily. In order to also gain mechanistic insight, interactions among and between ions and electrons have to be taken account of. This study shows how to implement them into the analysis.

         <title>Quantifying Charge Extraction and Recombination Using the Rise and Decay of the Transient Photovoltage of Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The rise time of transient photovoltage measurements on halide perovskite solar cells is used to quantify charge extraction. As the decay time of the photovoltage can be used to quantify recombination, the combination of rise and decay provides a complete analysis of recombination and extraction and its impact on photovoltaic performance.








Abstract
The extraction of photogenerated charge carriers and the generation of a photovoltage belong to the fundamental functionalities of any solar cell. These processes happen not instantaneously but rather come with finite time constants, e.g., a time constant related to the rise of the externally measured open circuit voltage following a short light pulse. Herein, a new method to analyze transient photovoltage measurements at different bias light intensities combining rise and decay times of the photovoltage. The approach uses a linearized version of a system of two coupled differential equations that are solved analytically by determining the eigenvalues of a 2&#160;&#215;&#160;2 matrix. By comparison between the eigenvalues and the measured rise and decay times during a transient photovoltage measurement, the rates of carrier recombination and extraction as a function of bias voltage are determined, and establish a simple link between their ratio and the efficiency losses in the perovskite solar cell.

         <title>Supported Ruthenium Single&#8208;Atom and Clustered Catalysts Outperform Benchmark Pt for Alkaline Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sodium cobalt oxide substrate provides active sites for the dissociation of water, and the generated H intermediates recombine to generate H2 on the Ru single atoms or clusters. Comparing the two kinds of Ru sites, Ru cluster dominates the alkaline HER activity due to the more fluent migration of H intermediates and its more favorable adsorption&#8211;desorption energetics toward H intermediates.








Abstract
Guaranteeing satisfactory catalytic behavior while ensuring high metal utilization has become the problem that needs to be addressed when designing noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based catalysts for electrochemical reactions. Here, well&#8208;dispersed ruthenium (Ru) based clusters with adjacent Ru single atoms (SAs) on layered sodium cobalt oxide (Ru/NC) are demonstrated as a superb electrocatalyst for alkaline HER. The Ru/NC catalyst demonstrates an activity increase by a factor of two relative to the commercial Pt/C. Operando characterizations in conjunction with density functional theory (DFT) simulations uncover the origin of the superior activity and establish a structure&#8211;performance relationship, that is, under HER condition, the real active species are Ru SAs and metallic Ru clusters supported on the NC substrate. The excellent alkaline HER activity of the Ru/NC catalyst can be understood by a spatially decoupled water dissociation and hydrogen desorption mechanism, where the NC substrate accelerates the water dissociation rate, and the generated H intermediates would then migrate to the Ru SAs or clusters and recombine to have H2 evolution. More importantly, comparing the two forms of Ru sites, it is the Ru cluster that dominates the HER activity.

         <title>A Multifunctional Additive Strategy Enables Efficient Pure&#8208;Blue Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;functional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate performs three functions on perovskites: dimensionality control, defect passivation, and surface modification. Consequently, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkable external quantum efficiency of 11.87% at 468&#160;nm, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue perovskite light&#8208;emitting devices.








Abstract
Lead halide perovskites have shown exceptional performance in light&#8208;emitting devices (PeLEDs), particularly in producing significant electroluminescence in sky&#8208;blue to near&#8208;infrared wavelengths. However, PeLEDs emitting pure&#8208;blue light at 465&#8211;475 nm are still not satisfactory. Herein, efficient and stable pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs are reported by controlling phase distribution, passivation of defects, as well as surface modifications using multifunctional phenylethylammonium trifluoroacetate (PEATFA) in reduced&#8208;dimensional p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA2Csn&#8722;1Pbn(Br0.55Cl0.45)3n+1 polycrystalline perovskite films. Compared with 4&#8208;fluorophenylethylammonium (p&#8208;F&#8208;PEA+) in the pristine films, phenylethylammonium (PEA+) has lower adsorption energy while interacting with perovskites, resulting in large&#8208;n low&#8208;dimensional perovskites, which can greatly facilitate charge transport within the low&#8208;dimensional perovskite films. The interaction between the C&#63742;O group in trifluoroacetate (TFA&#8722;) and perovskites significantly reduces defects in the perovskite films. Additionally, the electron&#8208;giving &#63743;CF3 group in TFA&#8208; uplifts surface potential in the films, resulting in smooth electronic injection in devices. The multifunctional additive strategy leads to elevated radiative recombination and efficient carrier transport in the films and devices. As a result, the devices exhibit a maximum external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 11.87% at 468 nm with stable spectral output, the highest reported to date for pure&#8208;blue PeLEDs. Thus, this study extends the way for high&#8208;efficiency pure&#8208;blue LED with perovskite polycrystal films.

         <title>Synergetic Enhancement of Strength&#8211;Ductility and Thermoelectric Properties of Ag2Te by Domain Boundaries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel nanodomain strategy for improving the mechanical and thermoelectric properties of materials simultaneously is presented. Ag2Te with suppressed lattice thermal conductivity and improved strength&#8211;ductility synergy is achieved. These findings provide new insights into grain and domain boundary engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical strength&#8211;ductility synergy.








Abstract
Simultaneously improving the mechanical and thermoelectric (TE) properties is significant for the engineering applications of inorganic TE materials. In this work, a novel nanodomain strategy is developed for Ag2Te compounds to yield 40% and 200% improved compressive strength (160&#160;MPa) and fracture strain (16%) when compared to domain&#8208;free samples (115&#160;MPa and 5.5%, respectively). The domained samples also achieve a 45% improvement in average ZT value. The domain boundaries (DBs) provide extra sites for dislocation nucleation while pinning the dislocation movement, resulting in superior strength and ductility. In addition, phonon scattering induced by DBs suppresses the lattice thermal conductivity of Ag2Te and also reduces the weighted mobility. These findings provide new insights into grain and DB engineering for high&#8208;performance inorganic semiconductors with robust mechanical properties.

Active Metamaterials
In article number 2303541, Ruike Renee Zhao and co&#8208;workers present a novel magneto&#8208;mechanical metamaterial that employs a double&#8208;layer design to change area density while preserving the overall area for good conformability during actuation. Magnetic actuation facilitates rapid and reversible structural deformation between multiple modes. This allows for the metamaterial to control the propagation of in&#8208;plane elastic waves of different frequencies.

Physical Unclonable Functions
In article number 2302135, Dong Ki Yoon and co&#8208;workers present a framework for the creation of physical unclonable function (PUF)&#8208;based authentication labels using DNA. The platform leverages the inherent stochastic birefringent pattern that emerges through the entropy&#8208;driven instability during the drying process of aqueous DNA solutions. By harnessing the disclinations within the DNA film, secure security codes are generated, exhibiting a level of randomness that ensures robust high&#8208;level security measures.

Gas Sensors
In article number 2302219, Suk Yeop Chun, Young Geun Song, Chong&#8208;Yun Kang, Jung Ho Yoon, and co&#8208;workers propose a hysteretic &#8220;chemi&#8208;memristive gas sensor&#8221; based on oxygen&#8208;vacancy chemi&#8208;memristive dynamics that differ from that of conventional gas sensors. Based on the advantageous functionality of the sensor, including fast responses, short recovery times, and hysteretic gas response, device&#8208;level olfactory systems that can monitor the history of input gas stimuli are experimentally demonstrated.

Organic Electrochemical Transistors
In article number 2300308, Natalie Banerji and co&#8208;workers present an organic electrochemical transistor (OECT) based on a conjugated polymer film. Switching on the transistor leads to oxidation of the polymer, forming polarons and bipolarons. The charges are compensated by ions that enter the film from the electrolyte. Using time&#8208;resolved spectroelectrochemistry, they show that polarons prefer the ordered regions of the film, while bipolarons are generated in the amorphous regions.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Bifunctional Single Atom Catalysts for Rechargeable Zinc&#8211;Air Batteries: From Dynamic Mechanism to Rational Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms, the rational regulations for various single atom catalysts (SACs) to improve their bifunctional activity and stability, and the challenges and future perspectives of bifunctional SACs for high&#8208;performance zinc&#8211;air batteries are discussed systematically.








Abstract
Ever&#8208;growing demands for rechargeable zinc&#8211;air batteries (ZABs) call for efficient bifunctional electrocatalysts. Among various electrocatalysts, single atom catalysts (SACs) have received increasing attention due to the merits of high atom utilization, structural tunability, and remarkable activity. Rational design of bifunctional SACs relies heavily on an in&#8208;depth understanding of reaction mechanisms, especially dynamic evolution under electrochemical conditions. This requires a systematic study in dynamic mechanisms to replace current trial and error modes. Herein, fundamental understanding of dynamic oxygen reduction reaction and oxygen evolution reaction mechanisms for SACs is first presented combining in situ and/or operando characterizations and theoretical calculations. By highlighting structure&#8211;performance relationships, rational regulation strategies are particularly proposed to facilitate the design of efficient bifunctional SACs. Furthermore, future perspectives and challenges are discussed. This review provides a thorough understanding of dynamic mechanisms and regulation strategies for bifunctional SACs, which are expected to pave the avenue for exploring optimum single atom bifunctional oxygen catalysts and effective ZABs.

         <title>Dendritic Solid Polymer Electrolytes: A New Paradigm for High&#8208;Performance Lithium&#8208;Based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the review, it is not only focused on reviewing dendritic polymer electrolytes (PEs) in basic concept, synthesis methodologies, balancing of properties, ion transport mechanism, etc. but also try to outline the possibility of dendritic PEs toward on&#8208;demand design. It is believed that including examples of designing advanced/safe dendritic PEs will show the readers a more comprehensive prospect of this burgeoning field.








Abstract
Li&#8208;ions battery is widely used and recognized, but its energy density based on organic electrolytes has approached the theoretical upper limit, while the use of organic electrolytes also brings some safety hazards (leakage and flammability). Polymer electrolytes (PEs) are expected to fundamentally solve the safety problem and improve energy density. Therefore, Li&#8208;ions battery based on solid PE has become a research hotspot in recent years. However, low ionic conductivity and poor mechanical properties, as well as a narrow electrochemical window limit its further development. Dendritic PEs with unique topology structure has low crystallinity, high segmental mobility, and reduced chain entanglement, providing a new avenue for designing high&#8208;performance PEs. In this review, the basic concept and synthetic chemistry of dendritic polymers are first introduced. Then, this story will turn to how to balance the mechanical properties, ionic conductivity, and electrochemical stability of dendritic PEs from synthetic chemistry. In addition, accomplishments on dendritic PEs based on different synthesis strategies and recent advances in battery applications are summarized and discussed. Subsequently, the ionic transport mechanism and interfacial interaction are deeply analyzed. In the end, the challenges and prospects are outlined to promote further development in this booming field.

         <title>Flexible and Stretchable Organic Electrochemical Transistors for Physiological Sensing Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) are an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks exhibiting significant advantages for developing flexible/stretchable physiological sensors. This review discusses structure, operation, critical features, a wide spectrum of physiological sensing mechanisms and uses, as well as major challenges and opportunities for flexible/stretchable OECTs, particularly for biochemical and bioelectrical sensor applications.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable bioelectronics provides a biocompatible interface between electronics and biological systems and has received tremendous attention for in situ monitoring of various biological systems. Considerable progress in organic electronics has made organic semiconductors, as well as other organic electronic materials, ideal candidates for developing wearable, implantable, and biocompatible electronic circuits due to their potential mechanical compliance and biocompatibility. Organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs), as an emerging class of organic electronic building blocks, exhibit significant advantages in biological sensing due to the ionic nature at the basis of the switching behavior, low driving voltage (&lt;1 V), and high transconductance (in millisiemens range). During the past few years, significant progress in constructing flexible/stretchable OECTs (FSOECTs) for both biochemical and bioelectrical sensors has been reported. In this regard, to summarize major research accomplishments in this emerging field, this review first discusses structure and critical features of FSOECTs, including working principles, materials, and architectural engineering. Next, a wide spectrum of relevant physiological sensing applications, where FSOECTs are the key components, are summarized. Last, major challenges and opportunities for further advancing FSOECT physiological sensors are discussed.

         <title>Cancer Models on Chip: Paving the Way to Large&#8208;Scale Trial Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 35, September 1, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
ToC devices may become state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art models for pharmaceutical oncology trials. To achieve this, the ToC should present reliability in mimicking the TME and monitoring biophysical and chemical signals using sensors and actuators. The translation of this technology to the industrial scale must take into consideration scalability and the standardization of the materials/biomaterials, architectures, actuators, and integration with analytical tools.








Abstract
Cancer kills millions of individuals every year all over the world (Global Cancer Observatory). The physiological and biomechanical processes underlying the tumor are still poorly understood, hindering researchers from creating new, effective therapies. Inconsistent results of preclinical research, in vivo testing, and clinical trials decrease drug approval rates. 3D tumor&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip (ToC) models integrate biomaterials, tissue engineering, fabrication of microarchitectures, and sensory and actuation systems in a single device, enabling reliable studies in fundamental oncology and pharmacology. This review includes a critical discussion about their ability to reproduce the tumor microenvironment (TME), the advantages and drawbacks of existing tumor models and architectures, major components and fabrication techniques. The focus is on current materials and micro/nanofabrication techniques used to manufacture reliable and reproducible microfluidic ToC models for large&#8208;scale trial applications.

         <title>Extreme Polarization Anisotropy in Resonant Third&#8208;Harmonic Generation from Aligned Carbon Nanotube Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) carbon nanotubes are synthesized, and third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) processes with extreme polarization anisotropy in the broad spectral range are studied, due to the 1D character of CNTs. The THG processes are enhanced by exciton resonance (S11, S22, and M11 excitons) in both films, revealing coupling between the excitons and nonlinear effects.








Abstract
Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) possess extremely anisotropic electronic, thermal, and optical properties owing to their 1D character. While their linear optical properties have been extensively studied, nonlinear optical processes, such as harmonic generation for frequency conversion, remain largely unexplored in CNTs, particularly in macroscopic CNT assemblies. In this work, macroscopic films of aligned and type&#8208;separated (semiconducting and metallic) CNTs are synthesized and polarization&#8208;dependent third&#8208;harmonic generation (THG) from the films with fundamental wavelengths ranging from 1.5 to 2.5&#160;&#181;m is studied. Both films exhibited strongly wavelength&#8208;dependent, intense THG signals, enhanced through exciton resonances, and third&#8208;order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of 2.50&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (semiconducting CNTs) and 1.23&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;19&#160;m2&#160;V&#8722;2 (metallic CNTs), respectively are found, for 1.8&#160;&#181;m excitation. Further, through systematic polarization&#8208;dependent THG measurements, the values of all elements of the susceptibility tensor are determined, verifying the macroscopically 1D nature of the films. Finally, polarized THG imaging is performed to demonstrate the nonlinear anisotropy in the large&#8208;size CNT film with good alignment. These findings promise applications of aligned CNT films in mid&#8208;infrared frequency conversion, nonlinear optical switching, polarized pulsed lasers, polarized long&#8208;wave detection, and high&#8208;performance anisotropic nonlinear photonic devices.

         <title>Direct 3D&#8208;Bioprinting of hiPSC&#8208;derived Cardiomyocytes to Generate Functional Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
3D&#8208;bioprinting is a promising technology to produce human tissues as drug screening tool or for organ repair. However, direct printing of living cells has proven difficult. Here, we present a method to directly 3D&#8208;bioprint human induced pluripotent stem cell (hiPSC)&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes embedded in a collagen&#8208;hyaluronic acid ink generating centimeter&#8208;sized functional ring&#8208; and ventricle&#8208;shaped cardiac tissues in an accurate and reproducible manner. The printed tissues contained hiPSC&#8208;derived cardiomyocytes with well&#8208;organized sarcomeres and exhibited spontaneous and regular contractions, which persisted for several months and were able to contract against passive resistance. Importantly, beating frequencies of the printed cardiac tissues could be modulated by pharmacological stimulation. This approach opens up new possibilities for generating complex functional cardiac tissues as models for advanced drug screening or as tissue grafts for organ repair or replacement.

         <title>A Polycrystalline Polymer Donor as Pre&#8208;Aggregate toward Ordered Molecular Aggregation for 19.3% Efficiency Binary Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.








Abstract
Organic semiconductors are generally featured with low structure order in solid&#8208;state films, which leads to low charge&#8208;transport mobility and strong charge recombination in their photovoltaic devices. In this work, a &#8220;polycrystal&#8208;induced aggregation&#8221; strategy orders the polymer donor (PM6) and non&#8208;fullerene acceptor (L8&#8208;BO) molecules during solution casting with the assistance of PM6 polycrystals that are incubated through a vapor diffusion method, toward improved solar cell efficiency with either thin or thick photoactive layers. These PM6 polycrystals are redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre&#8208;aggregates (PM6&#8208;PA), and further incorporated into the conventional PM6:L8&#8208;BO blend solutions, which is found to prolong the molecular organization process and enhance the aggregation of both the PM6 and the L8&#8208;BO components. As the results, with the assistance of 10% PM6&#8208;PA, PM6:L8&#8208;BO solar cell devices obtain power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) from 18.0% and 16.2% to 19.3% and 17.2% with a 100 nm&#8208;thick and 300&#160;nm&#8208;thick photoactive layer, respectively.

&lt;p&gt;PM6 polycrystals are incubated through a vapor diffusion method and redissolved in chloroform to prepare PM6 pre-aggregates, which can increase the structural order of both the donors and the acceptors in photovoltaic blends upon solution casting, consequently delivering high performance for both thin and thick junction organic solar cells.

         <title>Mold&#8208;Free Manufacturing of Highly Sensitive and Fast&#8208;Response Pressure Sensors Through High&#8208;Resolution 3D Printing and Conformal Oxidative Chemical Vapor Deposition Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Paradigm&#8208;shifting mold&#8208;free manufacturing is demonstrated for high&#8208;sensitivity and ultrafast responsive sensors using sub&#8208;10&#160;&#181;m 3D&#8208;printing and conformal chemical vapor deposition (CVD) polymers. Much&#8208;enhanced sensing performance is achieved, compared to those manufactured with mold&#8208;based techniques, due to the high electrical conductivity of the sensing element, oxidative CVD&#160;poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene), and the benefits from the multiscale (from micrometer&#160;to millimeter) patterns.








Abstract
A new manufacturing paradigm is showcased to exclude conventional mold&#8208;dependent manufacturing of pressure sensors, which typically requires a series of complex and expensive patterning processes. This mold&#8208;free manufacturing leverages high&#8208;resolution 3D&#8208;printed multiscale microstructures as the substrate and a gas&#8208;phase conformal polymer coating technique to complete the mold&#8208;free sensing platform. The array of dome and spike structures with a controlled spike density of a 3D&#8208;printed substrate ensures a large contact surface with pressures applied and extended linearity in a wider pressure range. For uniform coating of sensing elements on the microstructured surface, oxidative chemical vapor deposition is employed to deposit a highly conformal and conductive sensing element, poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) at low temperatures (&lt;60&#160;&#176;C). The fabricated pressure sensor reacts sensitively to various ranges of pressures (up to 185&#160;kPa&#8722;1) depending on the density of the multiscale features and shows an ultrafast response time (&#8776;36&#160;&#181;s). The mechanism investigations through the finite element analysis identify the effect of the multiscale structure on the figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit sensing performance. These unique findings are expected to be of significant relevance to technology that requires higher sensing capability, scalability, and facile adjustment of a sensor geometry in a cost&#8208;effective manufacturing manner.

         <title>Amphiphilic Cobalt Phthalocyanine Boosts Carbon Dioxide Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Amphiphilic tetra&#8208;carboxyphenyl&#8208;substituted cobalt phthalocyanine is designed to adjust the hydrophilic/hydrophobic property of CoPc/carbon hybrid materials from a molecular perspective. The catalyst maintains effective contact between the active sites and the electrolyte, and achieves efficient CO2RR in both H&#8208;type cell and MEA device with exceptional selectivity and stability.








Abstract
Due to the easy accessibility, chemical stability, and structural tunability of the macrocyclic skeleton, cobalt phthalocyanines immobilized on carbon supports offer an ideal research model for advanced electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (eCO2RR). In this work, an amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine (TC&#8208;CoPc) is loaded on multiwalled carbon nanotubes to reveal the roles of hydrophilic/hydrophobic properties on catalytic efficiency. Surprisingly, the resultant electrode exhibits a CO Faradaic efficiency (FECO) of 95% for CO2RR with turnover frequency (TOF) of 29.4 s&#8722;1 at an overpotential of 0.585&#160;V over long&#8208;term electrolysis in a H&#8208;type cell. In the membrane electrode assembly (MEA) device, the boosted transport of water vapor to the catalyst layer slows down carbonate crystallization and enhances the stability of the electrode, with FECO value of &gt;99% over 27 h at &#8722;0.25 A, representing the best selectivity and stability among reported molecular catalysts in MEA devices. The amphiphilic cobalt phthalocyanine, which decreases interfacial charge and mass transfer resistance and maintains effective contact between active sites and the electrolyte, highlights the exceptional CO2 conversion from a molecular perspective.

         <title>A Single&#8208;Molecule Bioelectronic Portable Array for Early Diagnosis of Pancreatic Cancer Precursors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A portable enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 96&#8208;array of bioelectronic sensors assays simultaneously both proteins and nucleic&#8208;acid biomarkers at the single&#8208;molecule level in 0.1&#160;mL of plasma. The prototype comprises a disposable cartridge and a reusable reader. A cohort of 47 patients is screened for the minimally invasive early diagnosis of pancreatic cancer. The mucinous&#8208;cysts precursors are 100% correctly classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis.








Abstract
A cohort of 47 patients is screened for pancreatic cancer precursors with a portable 96&#8208;well bioelectronic sensing&#8208;array for single&#8208;molecule assay in cysts fluid and blood plasma, deployable at point&#8208;of&#8208;care (POC). Pancreatic cancer precursors are mucinous cysts diagnosed with a sensitivity of at most 80% by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art cytopathological molecular analyses (e.g., KRASmut DNA). Adding the simultaneous assay of proteins related to malignant transformation (e.g., MUC1 and CD55) is deemed essential to enhance diagnostic accuracy. The bioelectronic array proposed here, based on single&#8208;molecule&#8208;with&#8208;a&#8208;large&#8208;transistor (SiMoT) technology, can assay both nucleic acids and proteins at the single&#8208;molecule limit&#8208;of&#8208;identification (LOI) (1% of false&#8208;positives and false&#8208;negatives). It comprises an enzyme&#8208;linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA)&#8208;like 8 &#215; 12&#8208;array organic&#8208;electronics disposable cartridge with an electrolyte&#8208;gated organic transistor sensor array, and a reusable reader, integrating a custom Si&#8208;IC chip, operating via software installed on a USB&#8208;connected smart device. The cartridge is complemented by a 3D&#8208;printed sensing gate cover plate. KRASmut, MUC1, and CD55 biomarkers either in plasma or cysts&#8208;fluid from 5 to 6 patients at a time, are multiplexed at single&#8208;molecule LOI in 1.5 h. The pancreatic cancer precursors are classified via a machine&#8208;learning analysis resulting in at least 96% diagnostic&#8208;sensitivity and 100% diagnostic&#8208;specificity. This preliminary study opens the way to POC liquid&#8208;biopsy&#8208;based early diagnosis of pancreatic&#8208;cancer precursors in plasma.

         <title>A Balance Between Inter&#8208; and Intra&#8208; Microgel Mechanics Governs Stem Cell Viability in Injectable Dynamic Granular Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Injectable hydrogels are increasingly explored for the delivery of cells to tissue. These materials exhibit both liquid&#8208;like properties, protecting cells from mechanical stress during injection, and solid&#8208;like properties, providing a stable 3D engraftment niche. Many strategies for modulating injectable hydrogels tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like material properties simultaneously, such that formulation changes designed to improve injectability can reduce stability at the delivery site. The ability to independently tune liquid&#8208; and solid&#8208;like properties would greatly facilitate formulation development. Here we demonstrate such a strategy in which cells are ensconced in the pores between microscopic granular hyaluronic acid (HA) hydrogels (microgels), where we tune elasticity with static covalent intra&#8208;microgel crosslinks and flowability with mechanosensitive adamantane&#8208;cyclodextrin (AC) inter&#8208;microgel crosslinks. Using the same AC&#8208;free microgels as a 3D printing support bath, we preserve the location of each cell as it exits the needle, allowing us to identify the mechanism driving mechanical trauma&#8208;induced cell death. We vary microgel AC concentration to find the threshold from microgel yielding&#8208; to AC interaction&#8208; dominated injectability and exploit this threshold to fabricate a microgel with better injection&#8208;protecting performance. Our delivery strategy, and the balance between intra&#8208; and inter&#8208;microgel properties it reveals, may facilitate the development of new cell injection formulations.

         <title>Nerve Visualization Using Phenoxazine&#8208;Based Near&#8208;Infrared Fluorophores to Guide Prostatectomy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Fluorescence&#8208;guided surgery (FGS) is poised to revolutionize surgical medicine through near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorophores for tissue&#8208; and disease&#8208;specific contrast. Clinical open and laparoscopic FGS vision systems operate nearly exclusively at NIR wavelengths. However, tissue&#8208;specific NIR contrast agents compatible with clinically available imaging systems are lacking, leaving nerve tissue identification during prostatectomy a persistent challenge. Here, we show that combining drug&#8208;like molecular design concepts and fluorophore chemistry enabled the production of a library of NIR phenoxazine&#8208;based fluorophores for intraoperative nerve&#8208;specific imaging. The lead candidate readily delineated prostatic nerves in the canine and iliac plexus in the swine models using the clinical da Vinci Surgical System that has been popularized for minimally invasive prostatectomy procedures. These results demonstrate the feasibility of molecular engineering of NIR nerve&#8208;binding fluorophores for ready integration into the existing surigical workflow, paving the path for clinical translation to reduce morbidity from nerve injury for prostate cancer patients.

         <title>Surfactant&#8208;free Ultrasonication&#8208;assisted Synthesis of 2d Tellurium Based on Metastable 1T'&#8208;MoTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Elemental two&#8208;dimensional materials (E2DMs) have been attracting considerable attention owing to their chemical simplicity and excellent/exotic properties. However, the lack of robust chemical synthetic methods seriously limits their potential. Here, we report a surfactant&#8208;free liquid&#8208;phase synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D tellurium based on ultrasonication&#8208;assisted exfoliation of metastable 1T'&#8208;MoTe2. The as&#8208;grown 2D tellurium nanosheets exhibit excellent single crystallinity, ideal 2D morphology, surfactant&#8208;free surface, and negligible 1D by&#8208;products. Furthermore, a unique growth mechanism based on the atomic escape of Te atoms from metastable transition metal dichalcogenides and guided 2D growth in the liquid phase was proposed and verified. 2D tellurium&#8208;based field&#8208;effect transistors show ultrahigh hole mobility exceeding 1000 cm2&#183;V&#8722;1&#183;s&#8722;1 at room temperature attributing to the high crystallinity and surfactant&#8208;free surface, and exceptional chemical and operational stability using both solid&#8208;state dielectric and liquid&#8208;state electrical double layer. The facile ultrasonication&#8208;assisted synthesis of high&#8208;quality 2D tellurium paves the way for further exploration of E2DMs and expands the scope of liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation (LPE) methodology towards the controlled wet&#8208;chemical synthesis of functional nanomaterials.

         <title>Monolithic 3D Integration of Analog RRAM&#8208;based Computing&#8208;in&#8208;Memory and Sensor for Energy&#8208;Efficient Near&#8208;Sensor Computing</title>

Abstract
In the era of the Internet of Things, vast amounts of data generated at numerous sensory nodes impose critical challenges on the data&#8208;transfer bandwidth and energy efficiency of computing hardware. A near&#8208;sensor computing (NSC) architecture places the processing units closer to the sensors such that the generated data can be processed almost in situ with high efficiency. This study demonstrates the monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (M3D) integration of a photosensor array, analog computing&#8208;in&#8208;memory (CIM), and Si complementary metal&#8208;oxide&#8208;semiconductor (CMOS) logic circuits, named M3D&#8208;SAIL. This approach exploits the high&#8208;bandwidth on&#8208;chip data transfer and massively parallel CIM cores to realize an energy&#8208;efficient NSC architecture. The 1st layer of the Si CMOS circuits served as the control logic and peripheral circuits. The 2nd layer comprised a 1k&#8208;bit one&#8208;transistor&#8208;one&#8208;resistor (1T1R) array with InGaZnOx field&#8208;effect transistor (IGZO&#8208;FET) and resistive random&#8208;access memory (RRAM) for analog CIM. The 3rd layer comprised multiple IGZO&#8208;FET&#8208;based photosensor arrays for wavelength&#8208;dependent optical sensing. The structural integrity and function of each layer were comprehensively verified. Furthermore, NSC was implemented using the M3D&#8208;SAIL architecture for a typical video keyframe&#8208;extraction task, achieving a high classification accuracy of 96.7% as well as a 31.5&#215; lower energy consumption and 1.91&#215; faster computing speed compared to its 2D counterpart.

         <title>A Novel Superparamagnetic Multifunctional Nerve Scaffold: Remote Actuation Strategy to Boost in situ Extracellular Vesicles Production for Enhanced Peripheral Nerve Repair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) have inherent advantages over cell&#8208;based therapies in regenerative medicine because their cargos of abundant bioactive cues. Several strategies are proposed to tune EVs production in vitro. However, it remains a challenge for manipulation of EVs production in vivo, which poses significant difficulties for EVs&#8208;based therapies that aim to promote tissue regeneration, particularly for long&#8208;term treatment of diseases like peripheral neuropathy. Herein, a superparamagnetic nanocomposite scaffold capable of controlling EVs production on&#8208;demand is constructed by incorporating polyethyleneglycol/polyethyleneimine modified superparamagnetic nanoparticles into polyacrylamide/hyaluronic acid double&#8208;network hydrogel (Mag&#8208;gel). The Mag&#8208;gel is highly sensitive to rotating magnetic field (RMF), and could act as mechano&#8208;stimulative platform to exert micro/nano&#8208;scale forces on encapsulated Schwann cells (SCs), an essential glial cell in supporting nerve regeneration. By switching the ON/OFF state of RMF, the Mag&#8208;gel could scale up local production of SCs&#8208;derived EVs (SCs&#8208;EVs) both in vitro and in vivo. Further transcriptome sequencing indicated an enrichment of transcripts favorable in axon growth, angiogenesis, and inflammatory regulation of SCs&#8208;EVs in Mag&#8208;gel with RMF, which ultimately results in optimized nerve repair in vivo. Overall, our research provides a noninvasive and remotely time&#8208;scheduled method for fine&#8208;tuning EVs&#8208;based therapies to accelerate tissue regeneration, including that of peripheral nerves.

         <title>In situ self&#8208;elimination of defects via controlled perovskite crystallization dynamics for high&#8208;performance solar cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Understanding and controlling the crystallization process is critical to achieving high&#8208;quality perovskite films and efficient solar cells. Herein, we identified that one key issue in the formation of formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) defects is the participation of the intermediates in the crystallization process. A comprehensive picture of structural and carrier evolution during crystallization was demonstrated using a combination of in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering, UV&#8208;Vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopies. Three crystallization stages were registered for the commonly observed conversion pathway of precursors &#8211; &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 intermediate &#8211; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of defects was found. We found that a hydrogen sulfate&#8208;based ionic liquid additive enabled the phase conversion pathway of precursors &#8211; solvated intermediates &#8211; &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, during which the spontaneous generation of &#948;&#8208;FAPbI3 can be effectively circumvented. Both growth kinetics at the initial crystallization stage and the following recrystallization of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 were significantly prolonged because of the additional exchange process between solvents and FA+, which resulted in the self&#8208;elimination of defects during crystallization. Therefore, the improved crystallization dynamics led to larger grain sizes and fewer defects within thin films. The improved perovskite crystallization dynamics finally transformed into high&#8208;performance solar cells under one&#8208;sun illumination (AM 1.5 G) with efficiency as high as 25.14% at 300 K. These cells delivered a PCE of 26.12% at 240 K, which might open up a new era of application of this emerging photovoltaic technology to low&#8208;temperature environments such as near&#8208;space and polar regions.

         <title>Electrocatalytic CO2 Reduction to C2+ Products in Flow Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic CO2 reduction into value&#8208;added fuels and chemicals by renewable electric energy is one of the important strategies to address global energy shortage and carbon emission. Though the classical H&#8208;type electrolytic cell can quickly screen high&#8208;efficiency catalysts, the low current density and limited CO2 mass transfer process essentially impede its industrial applications. The electrolytic cells based on electrolyte flow system (flow cells) have shown great potential for industrial devices, due to higher current density, improved local CO2 concentration and better mass transfer efficiency. The design and optimization of flow cells are of great significance to further accelerate the industrialization of electrocatalytic CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR). In this review, we are concerned with the progress of flow cells for CO2RR to C2+ products. Firstly, we outline the main events in the development of the flow cells for CO2RR. Secondly, the main design principles of CO2RR to C2+ products, the architectures and types of flow cells are summarized. Thirdly, the main strategies for optimizing flow cells to generate C2+ products are reviewed in detail, including cathode, anode, ion exchange membrane, and electrolyte. Finally, we discuss the preliminary attempts, challenges and the research prospects of flow cells for industrial CO2RR toward C2+ products.

         <title>Azacyclic Anchor&#8208;Enabled Cohesive Graphite Electrodes for Sustainable Anion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Advanced energy storage devices are indispensable for expanding electric mobility applications. While anion intercalation&#8208;type redox chemistry in graphite cathodes has opened the path to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries, surpassing the limited energy density of conventional lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), a significant challenge remains: the large volume expansion of graphite upon anion intercalation. In this study,&#160;we&#160;present a novel polymeric binder and cohesive graphite cathode design for dual&#8208;ion batteries (DIBs), which exhibit remarkable stability even under high voltage conditions (&gt;5&#160;V). The innovative binder incorporates an acrylate moiety ensuring superior oxidative stability and self&#8208;healing features, along with an azide moiety, which allows for azacyclic covalent bonding with graphite and interchain crosslinking. A simple one&#8208;hour ultraviolet (UV) treatment is sufficient for binder fixation within the electrode, leading to the covalent bond formation with graphite and the creation of a robust three&#8208;dimensional network. This modification facilitates deeper and more reversible anion intercalation, leading to improved capacity, extended lifespan, and sustainable anion storage.&#160;Our&#160;binder design, exhibiting exceptional adhesive properties and effective stress mitigation, enables the construction of ultrathick graphite cathodes. These findings provide valuable insights for the development of advanced binders, paving the way for high&#8208;performance DIBs.

         <title>Highly Crystalized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 Nanocrystals for Stable Aqueous Dispersion Toward High&#8208;Performance Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Tin dioxide (SnO2) with high conductivity and low photocatalytic activity has been reported as one of the best candidates for highly efficient electron transport layer (ETL) in perovskite solar cell (PSC). The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art SnO2 layer is achieved by chemical bath deposition with tunable properties, while the commercial SnO2 nanocrystals (NCs) with low tunability still face the necessity of further improvement. Here, we report a kind of highly crystallized Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs that can form very stable aqueous dispersion with shelf life up to one year without any stabilizer, which can facilitate the fabrication of PSCs with satisfactory performance. Compared to the commercial SnO2 NCs regardless of the extrinsic Cl&#8208;doping conditions, the intrinsic Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs effectively suppress the energy barrier and reduced the trap state density at the buried interface between perovskite and ETL. Consequently, stable PSCs based on such Cl&#8208;doped SnO2 NCs achieve a champion efficiency up to &#8764;25% for small cell (0.085 cm2) and &#8764;20% for mini&#8208;module (12.125 cm2), indicating its potential as a promising candidate for ETL in high&#8208;performance perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Integrating Liquification of The Gelated Tumor Interstitium Around Nanomedicines with Biconditional GD2&#8208;targeting for Precise And Safe Chemotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The quick diffusion of nanomedicines in the polysaccharide&#8208;gel&#8208;filling tumor interstitium and precise active targeting are two major obstacles that have not yet been overcome. Here, we developed a poly(L&#8208;glutamyl&#8208;L&#8208;lysine(EK) (p(EK))&#8208;camouflaged, doxorubicin (Dox)&#8208;conjugated nanomedicine to demonstrate the underlying mechanism of zwitterionic shell in synchronous barrier&#8208;penetration and biconditional active targeting. The zwitterionic p(EK) shell liquifies its surrounding water molecules in the polysaccharide gel of tumor&#160;interstitium, leading to 5 times faster diffusion than the pegylated Doxil&#174; with similar size in tumor tissue. Its doped sulfonate groups lead to more precise active tumor&#8208;targeting than disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody by meeting the dual requirements of tumor microenvironment (TME) pH and overexpression of GD2 on tumor. Consequently, the concentrations of the nanomedicine in tumor are always higher than in life&#8208;supported organs in whole accumulation process, reaching over 10 times higher Dox in GD2&#8208;overexpressing MCF&#8208;7 tumors than in life&#8208;supporting organs. Furthermore, the nanomedicine also avoids anti&#8208;GD2&#8208;like accumulation in GD2&#8208;expressing kidney in a mouse model. Thus, the nanomedicine expands the therapeutic window of Doxil&#174; by more than 3 times and eliminates tumors with negligible myocardial and acute toxicity. This new insight paves an avenue to design nanodelivery systems for highly precise and safe chemotherapy.

         <title>Completely Activated and Phase&#8208;Transformed KFeMnHCF for Zn/K Hybrid Batteries with 14&#160;500 Cycles by an OH&#8208;Rich Hydrogel Electrolyte</title>

         <dc:description>
The utilization of hydroxyl&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes with extended electrochemical stability windows activates the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe within the KxFeyMn1&#8722;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while concurrently tuning its structure. The robust adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte prevents the KFeMnHCF particles from detaching and dissolving. The facile desolvation of metal ions within the developed hydrogel electrolytes facilitates reversible (de)intercalationin KFeMnHCF cathode.

Abstract
Metal hexacyanoferrates are recognized as superior cathode materials for zinc and zinc hybrid batteries, particularly the Prussian blue analog (PBA). However, PBA development is hindered by several limitations, including small capacities (&lt;70&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1) and short lifespans (&lt;1000 cycles). These limitations generally arise due to incomplete activation of redox sites and structure collapse during intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in PBAs. According to this study, the adoption of a hydroxyl&#8208;rich (OH&#8208;rich) hydrogel electrolyte with extended electrochemical stability windows (ESWs) can effectively activate the redox site of low&#8208;spin Fe of the KxFeyMn1&#8722;y[Fe(CN)6]w&#183;zH2O (KFeMnHCF) cathode while tuning its structure. Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH&#8208;rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn||KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14&#160;500 cycles, a 1.7&#160;V discharge plateau, and a 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.

Additionally, the strong adhesion of the hydrogel electrolyte inhibits KFeMnHCF particles from falling off the cathode and dissolving. The easy desolvation of metal ions in the developed OH-rich hydrogel electrolytes can lead to a fast and reversible intercalation/deintercalation of metal ions in the PBA cathode. As a result, the Zn||KFeMnHCF hybrid batteries achieve the unprecedented characteristics of 14&#160;500 cycles, a 1.7&#160;V discharge plateau, and a 100&#160;mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; discharge capacity. The results of this study provide a new understanding of the development of zinc hybrid batteries with PBA cathode materials and present a promising new electrolyte material for this application.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks Embedded with Iodine for High&#8208;Performance Ammonium&#8208;Ion Hybrid Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) is demonstrated as an electroactive cathode material for advanced NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. Benefiting from excellent electrical conductivity, abundant Cu&#9472;O4 species, and adsorbed iodide at the Cu sites of the Cu&#8208;HHB/I2, an assembled NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver a superior energy density (31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2) and record&#8208;long cycling lifetime (89.5% after 10&#160;000 cycles).








Abstract
Ammonium ions (NH4+) are emerging non&#8208;metallic charge carriers for advanced electrochemical energy storage devices, due to their low cost, elemental abundance, and environmental benignity. However, finding suitable electrode materials to achieve rapid diffusion kinetics for NH4+ storage remains a great challenge. Herein, a 2D conjugated metal&#8211;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) for immobilizing iodine, as a high&#8208;performance cathode material for NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors, is reported. Cu&#8208;HHB (HHB = hexahydroxybenzene) MOF embedded with iodine (Cu&#8208;HHB/I2) features excellent electrical conductivity, highly porous structure, and rich accessible active sites of copper&#8208;bis(dihydroxy) (Cu&#9472;O4) and iodide species, resulting in a remarkable areal capacitance of 111.7 mF cm&#8722;2 at 0.4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Experimental results and theoretical calculations indicate that the Cu&#9472;O4 species in Cu&#8208;HHB play a critical role in binding polyiodide and suppressing its dissolution, as well as contributing to a large pseudocapacitance with adsorbed iodide. In combination with a porous MXene anode, the full NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors deliver an excellent energy density of 31.5 mWh cm&#8722;2 and long&#8208;term cycling stability with 89.5% capacitance retention after 10&#160;000 cycles, superior to those of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art NH4+ hybrid supercapacitors. This study sheds light on the material design for NH4+ storage, enabling the development of novel high&#8208;performance energy storage devices.

         <title>Customized Microenvironments Spontaneously Facilitate Coupled Engineering of Real&#8208;Life Large&#8208;Scale Clean Water Capture and Pollution Remediation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds&#8221; strategy for the large&#8208;scale production of drinking water directly from contaminated seawater is proposed. The strategy is based on a novel coupling perspective (parallel reaction space) to achieve photocatalytic degradation of pollutants while capturing clean water. It is demonstrated that this evaporator (CCMs&#8208;x) is widely adaptable and persistent to multiple real&#8208;life scenarios with excellent scalability. This work makes it crucial to elucidate the photocatalytic mechanism and gain insight into the performance of catalytic materials at the microscopic level.








Abstract
Harnessing abundant renewable resources and pollutants on a large scale to address environmental challenges, while providing sustainable freshwater, is a significant endeavour. This study presents the design of fully functional solar vaporization devices (SVD) based on organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid nanocomposites (CCMs&#8208;x). These devices exhibit efficient photothermal properties that facilitate multitargeted interfacial reactions, enabling simultaneous catalysis of sewage and desalination. The localized interfacial heating generated by the photothermal effect of CCMs&#8208;x triggers surface&#8208;dominated catalysis and steam generation. The CCMs&#8208;x SVD achieves a solar water&#8208;vapor generation rate of 1.41&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 (90.8%), and it achieves over 95% removal of pollutants within 60&#160;min under one&#8208;sun for practical application. The exceptional photothermal conversion rate of wastewater for environmental remediation and water capture is attributed to customized microenvironments within the system. The integrated parallel reaction system in SVD ensures it is a real&#8208;life application in multiple scenarios such as municipal/medical wastewater and brine containing high concentrations. Additionally, the SVD exhibits long&#8208;term durability, antifouling functionality toward complex ionic contaminants. This study not only demonstrates a one&#8208;stone&#8211;two&#8208;birds strategy for large&#8208;scale direct production of potable water from polluted seawater, but also opens up exciting possibilities for parallel production of energy and water resources.

         <title>Tuning Coordination Structures of Zn Sites Through Symmetry&#8208;Breaking Accelerates Electrocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Manipulating the coordination environment of individual active sites in a precise manner remains an important challenge in electrocatalytic reactions. Herein, inspired by theoretical predictions, we present a facile procedure to synthesize a series of symmetry&#8208;breaking zinc metal&#8208;organic framework (Zn&#8208;MOF) catalysts with well&#8208;defined structures. Benefiting from the optimized coordination microenvironment regulated by symmetry&#8208;breaking, Zn&#8208;N2S2&#8208;MOF exhibits the best performance of N2 reduction reaction (NRR) with NH3 yield rate of 25.07 &#177; 1.57&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and Faradaic efficiency of 44.57 &#177; 2.79% compared with reported Zn&#8208;based NRR catalysts. X&#8208;ray absorption near&#8208;edge structure shows that the symmetry&#8208;breaking distorts the coordination environment and modulates the delocalized electrons around the Zn sites, which favors the formation of unpaired low&#8208;valence Zn&#948;+, thereby facilitating the adsorption/activation of N2. Theoretical calculations elucidate that low&#8208;valence Zn&#948;+ in Zn&#8208;N2S2&#8208;MOF can effectively lower the energy barrier of potential determining step, promoting the kinetics and boosting the NRR activity. This work highlights the relationship between the precise coordination environment of metal sites and the catalytic activity, which offers insightful guidance for rationally designing high&#8208;efficiency electrocatalysts.

         <title>Review on Fatigue of Additive Manufactured Metallic Alloys: Microstructure, Performance, Enhancement and Assessment Methods</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing (AM), which is a process of building objects in a layer&#8208;upon&#8208;layer fashion from designed models, has received unprecedented attention from research and industry because it offers outstanding merits of flexibility, customization, reduced buy&#8208;to&#8208;fly ratio, and cost&#8208;effectiveness. However, the fatigue performance of safety&#8208;critical industrial components fabricated by AM is still far below that obtained from conventional methods. This review discusses the microstructural heterogeneities, randomly dispersed defects, poor surface quality, and complex residual stress generated during the AM process that can negatively impact the fatigue performance of as&#8208;printed parts. The difference in microstructural origin of fatigue failure between conventionally manufactured and printed metals is reviewed with particular attention to the effects of the trans&#8208;scale microstructures on AM fatigue failure mechanisms. Various methods for mitigating the fatigue issue, including pre&#8208;process, inter&#8208;process and post&#8208;process treatments, are illustrated. Empirical, semi&#8208;empirical and microstructure&#8208;sensitive models are presented to predict fatigue strength and lifetime. Summary and outlooks for future development of the fatigue performance of AM materials are provided.

         <title>Liquids with High Compressibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Compressibility is a fundamental property of all materials. For fluids, i.e., gases and liquids, compressibility forms the basis of technologies such as pneumatics and hydraulics and determines basic phenomena such as the propagation of sound and shock waves.[2] In contrast to gases, liquids are almost incompressible. If the compressibility of liquids could be increased and controlled, new applications in hydraulics and shock absorption could result. Here, we show that dispersing hydrophobic porous particles into water gives aqueous suspensions with much greater compressibilities than any normal liquids such as water[3] (specifically, up to 20 times greater over certain pressure ranges). The increased compressibility results from water molecules being forced into the hydrophobic pores of the particles under applied pressure. The degree of compression can be controlled by varying the amount of porous particles added. Also, the pressure range of compression can be reduced by adding methanol or increased by adding salt. In all cases, the liquids expand back to their original volume when the applied pressure is released. The approach shown here is simple and economical and could potentially be scaled up to give large amounts of highly compressible liquids for the first time.

         <title>Outer Membrane Vesicle&#8208;Based Nanohybrids Target Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophages to Enhance Trained Immunity&#8208;Related Vaccine&#8208;Generated Antitumor Activity</title>

Abstract
Trained immunity refers to the innate immune system building memory&#8208;like features in response to subsequent infections and vaccinations. Compared with classical tumor vaccines, trained immunity&#8208;related vaccines (TIrV) are independent of tumor&#8208;specific antigens. Bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) contain an abundance of PAMPs and have the potential to act as TIrV&#8208;inducer, but face challenges in endotoxin tolerance, systemic delivery, long&#8208;term training, and trained tumor&#8208;associated macrophage (TAM)&#8208;mediated antitumor phagocytosis. Here, we developed an OMV&#8208;based TIrV, OMV nanohybrids (OMV&#8208;SIRP&#945;@CaP/GM&#8208;CSF) for exerting vaccine&#8208;enhanced antitumor activity. In the bone marrow, GM&#8208;CSF&#8208;assisted OMVs trained bone marrow progenitor cells and monocytes, which were inherited by TAMs. In tumor tissues, SIRP&#945;&#8208;Fc&#8208;assisted OMVs triggered TAM&#8208;mediated phagocytosis. This TIrV can be identified by metabolic and epigenetic rewiring using transposase&#8208;accessible chromatin (ATAC) and transcriptome sequencing. Furthermore, we found that the TIrV&#8208;mediated antitumor mechanism in MC38 tumor model (TAM&#8208;hot &amp; T cell&#8208;cold) is trained immunity and activated T cell response, whereas in B16&#8208;F10 tumor model (T cell&#8208;hot &amp; TAM&#8208;cold) is primarily mediated by trained immunity. Our study not only developed and identified OMV&#8208;based TIrV, but also investigated the trained immunity signatures and therapeutic mechanisms, providing a basis for further vaccination strategies.

         <title>Mechanochromism and Strain&#8208;Induced Crystallization in Thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;Derived Stereoelastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Semicrystalline, mechanochromic stereoelastomers possessing spiropyran mechanophores are synthesized via thiol&#8208;yne Michael addition polymerization. Tensile tests across two decades of strain rates reveal significant correlations between strain hardening, strain&#8208;induced crystallization, and mechanochromism, which exhibits a novel multiregime behavior. Spiropyran recovery kinetics after failure are controlled by strain&#8208;induced crystallization, resulting in record activation lifetimes.








Abstract
Most elastomers undergo strain&#8208;induced crystallization (SIC) under tension; as individual chains are held rigidly in a fixed position by an applied strain, their alignment along the strain field results in a shift from strain&#8208;hardening (SH) to SIC. A similar degree of stretching is associated with the tension necessary to accelerate mechanically coupled, covalent chemical responses of mechanophores in overstretched chains, raising the possibility of an interplay between the macroscopic response of SIC and the molecular response of mechanophore activation. Here, thiol&#8208;yne&#8208;derived stereoelastomers doped covalently with a dipropiolate&#8208;derivatized spiropyran (SP) mechanophore (0.25&#8211;0.38&#160;mol%) are reported. The material properties of SP&#8208;containing films are consistent with undoped controls, indicating that the SP is a reporter of the mechanical state of the polymer. Uniaxial tensile tests reveal correlations between mechanochromism and SIC, which are strain&#8208;rate&#8208;dependent. When mechanochromic films are stretched slowly to the point of mechanophore activation, the covalently tethered mechanophore remains trapped in a force&#8208;activated state, even after the applied stress is removed. Mechanophore reversion kinetics correlate with the applied strain rate, resulting in highly tunable decoloration rates. Because these polymers are not covalently crosslinked, they are recyclable by melt&#8208;pressing into new films, increasing their potential range of strain&#8208;sensing, morphology&#8208;sensing, and shape&#8208;memory applications.

         <title>Achieving All&#8208;Plateau and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Insertion in Topological Graphitized Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon is constructed through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy. Evidence from advanced techniques indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements, resulting in a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1.








Abstract
Hard carbon anodes with all&#8208;plateau capacities below 0.1&#160;V are prerequisites to achieve high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium&#8208;ion storage, which holds promise for future sustainable energy technologies. However, challenges in removing defects and improving the insertion of sodium ions head off the development of hard carbon to achieve this goal. Herein, a highly cross&#8208;linked topological graphitized carbon using biomass corn cobs through a two&#8208;step rapid thermal&#8208;annealing strategy is reported. The topological graphitized carbon constructed with long&#8208;range graphene nanoribbons and cavities/tunnels provides a multidirectional insertion of sodium ions whilst eliminating defects to absorb sodium ions at the high voltage region. Evidence from advanced techniques including in situ XRD, in situ Raman, and in situ/ex situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates that the sodium ions' insertion and Na cluster formation occurred between curved topological graphite layers and in the topological cavity of adjacent graphite band entanglements. The reported topological insertion mechanism enables outstanding battery performance with a single full low&#8208;voltage plateau capacity of 290&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1, which is almost 97% of the total capacity.

         <title>Intrinsically Stretchable and Efficient Fully &#928;&#8208;Conjugated Polymer via Internal Plasticization for Flexible Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes with CIEy = 0.08</title>

         <dc:description>
A universal internal plasticization strategy is proposed to construct intrinsically stretchable and efficient fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers for the flexible deep&#8208;blue polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs). The introduction of pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers in polyfluorenes can simultaneously obtain excellent intrinsic stretchability, robust deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence, and comparable charge&#8208;transport behavior. Stable deep&#8208;blue PLEDs based on stretchable layers are also fabricated with a CIE of (0.15, 0.08).








Abstract
Intrinsically stretchable polymeric semiconductors are essential to flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) owing to their excellent strain tolerance capacity under long&#8208;time deformation operation. Obtaining intrinsic stretchability, robust emission properties, and excellent charge&#8208;transport behavior simultaneously from fully &#960;&#8208;conjugated polymers (FCPs) is difficult, particularly for applications in deep&#8208;blue PLEDs. Herein, an internal plasticization strategy is proposed to introduce a phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizer into polyfluorenes (PF&#8208;MC4, PF&#8208;MC6, and PF&#8208;MC8) for narrowband deep&#8208;blue flexible PLEDs. Compared with controlled poly[4&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl]&#8208;co&#8208;[5&#8208;(octyloxy)&#8208;9,9&#8208;diphenylfluoren&#8208;2,7&#8208;diyl] (PODPFs) (2.5%), the freestanding PF&#8208;MC8 thin film shows a fracture strain of &gt;25%. The three stretchable films exhibit stable and efficient deep&#8208;blue emission (PLQY &gt; 50%) because of the encapsulation of &#960;&#8208;conjugated backbone via pendant phenyl&#8208;ester plasticizers. The PF&#8208;MC8&#8208;based PLEDs show deep&#8208;blue emission, which corresponds to CIE and EQE values of (0.16, 0.10) and 1.06%, respectively. Finally, the narrowband deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF&#8208;MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&#8722;2 at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.

Finally, the narrowband deep-blue electroluminescence (FWHM of &#8776;25&#160;nm; CIE coordinates: (0.15, 0.08)) and performance of the transferred PLEDs based on the PF-MC8 stretchable film are independent of the tensile ratio (up to 45%); however, they show a maximum brightness of 1976&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; at a ratio of 35%. Therefore, internal plasticization is a promising approach for designing intrinsically stretchable FCPs for flexible electronics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Light&#8208;Driven Self&#8208;Oscillation of Thermoplasmonic Nanocolloids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;oscillation is the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus. A new self&#8208;oscillator model is presented in which photoactive plasmonic nanoparticles display periodic clustering under non&#8208;periodic illumination. The surface temperature of nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at infrasonic/acoustic frequencies. Further mathematical extension of the model suggests the emergence of a thermoplasmonic attractor.








Abstract
Self&#8208;oscillation&#8212;the periodic change of a system under a non&#8208;periodic stimulus&#8212;is vital for creating low&#8208;maintenance autonomous devices in soft robotics technologies. Soft composites of macroscopic dimensions are often doped with plasmonic nanoparticles to enhance energy dissipation and generate periodic response. However, while it is still unknown whether a dispersion of photonic nanocrystals may respond to light as a soft actuator, a dynamic analysis of nanocolloids self&#8208;oscillating in a liquid is also lacking. This study presents a new self&#8208;oscillator model for illuminated colloidal systems. It predicts that the surface temperature of thermoplasmonic nanoparticles and the number density of their clusters jointly oscillate at frequencies ranging from infrasonic to acoustic values. New experiments with spontaneously clustering gold nanorods, where the photothermal effect alters the interplay of light (stimulus) with the disperse system on a macroscopic scale, strongly support the&#160;theory. These findings enlarge the current view on self&#8208;oscillation phenomena and anticipate the colloidal state of matter to be a suitable host for accommodating light&#8208;propelled machineries. In broad terms, a complex system behavior is observed, which goes from periodic solutions (Hopf&#8211;Poincar&#233;&#8211;Andronov bifurcation) to a new dynamic attractor driven by nanoparticle interactions, linking thermoplasmonics to nonlinearity and&#160;chaos.

         <title>Modulating the d&#8208;Band Center Enables Ultrafine Pt3Fe Alloy Nanoparticles for pH&#8208;Universal Hydrogen Evolution Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported&#160;ultrafine Pt3Fe alloy nanoparticles (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. Owing to the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions that intentionally modulate the d&#8208;band center of Pt 5d orbital, both the required energy barrier for H2O dissociation and adsorption energy for H* intermediates are reduced, thereby resulting in the enhanced HER activities of Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A in acidic, alkaline, and neutral conditions.








Abstract
By providing dual active sites to synergistically accelerate H2O dissociation and H+ reduction, ordered intermetallic alloys usually show extraordinary performance for pH&#8208;universal hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Herein, activated N&#8208;doped mesoporous carbon spheres supported intermetallic Pt3Fe alloys (Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A), as a highly&#8208;efficient electrocatalyst for pH&#8208;universal HER, are reported. The Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A exhibits low overpotentials (&#951;10) of 13, 29, and 48&#160;mV to deliver 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 0.5&#160;m&#160;H2SO4, 1.0&#160;m&#160;KOH, and 1.0&#160;m phosphate buffered solution (PBS), respectively, as well as robust stability to maintain the overall catalytic performances. Theoretical studies reveal that the strong Pt 5d&#8211;Fe 3d orbital electronic interactions negatively shift the d&#8208;band center (&#949;d) of Pt 5d orbital, resulting in reduced H* adsorption energy of Pt sites and enhanced acidic HER activity. With Pt and Fe acting as co&#8208;adsorption sites for H* and *OH intermediates, respectively, a low energy barrier is required for Pt3Fe/NMCS&#8208;A to dissociate H2O to afford H* intermediates, which greatly promotes the H* adsorption and H2 formation in alkaline and neutral conditions. The synthetic strategy is further extended to the synthesis of Pt3Co and Pt3Ni alloys with excellent HER activity in pH&#8208;universal electrolytes, demonstrating the great potential of these Pt&#8208;based alloys for practical applications.

         <title>Reversible Crosslinking of Commodity Polymers via Photocontrolled Metal&#8211;Ligand Coordination for High&#8208;Performance and Recyclable Thermoset Plastics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared using a commodity polyacrylonitrile and reversible crosslinker via reversible metal&#8211;ligand coordination. The thermosets are mechanically robust, and they are recyclable via reversible coordination upon light irradiation in a solvent and heating. This reversible coordination method enables the preparation of recyclable materials using other commodity polymers and polymer composites. The thermosets can be recycled from plastic waste.








Abstract
Thermoset plastics, highly desired for their stability, durability, and chemical resistance, are currently consumed in over 60 million tons annually across the globe, but they are difficult to recycle due to their crosslinked structures. The development of recyclable thermoset plastics is an important but challenging task. In this work, recyclable thermoset plastics are prepared by crosslinking a commodity polymer, polyacrylonitrile (PAN), with a small percentage of a Ru complex via nitrile&#8211;Ru coordination. PAN is obtained from industry and the Ru complex is synthesized in one step, which enables the production of recyclable thermoset plastics in an efficient way. In addition, the thermoset plastics exhibit impressive mechanical performance, boasting a Young's modulus of 6.3&#160;GPa and a tensile strength of 109.8&#160;MPa. Moreover, they can be de&#8208;crosslinked when exposed to both light and a solvent and can then be re&#8208;crosslinked upon heating. This reversible crosslinking mechanism enables the recycling of thermosets from a mixture of plastic waste. The preparation of recyclable thermosets from other commodity polymers such as poly(styrene&#8208;coacrylonitrile) (SAN) resins and polymer composites through reversible crosslinking is also demonstrated. This study shows that reversible crosslinking via metal&#8211;ligand coordination is a new strategy for designing recyclable thermosets using commodity polymers.

         <title>Indirect Electrocatalysis S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S Bond Construction by Robust Polyoxometalate Based Foams</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstate based foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) with tunable loadings (17 to 44 wt%) is fabricated, which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides.








Abstract
Indirect electrocatalytic conversion of cheap organic raw materials via the activation of S&#9472;H and N&#9472;H bonds into the value&#8208;added S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds chemicals for industrial rubber production is a promising strategy to realize the atomic economic reaction, during which the kinetic inhibition that is associated with the electron transfer at the electrode/electrolyte interface in traditional direct electrocatalysis can be eliminated to achieve higher performance. In this work, a series of di&#8208;copper&#8208;substituted phosphotungstatebased foams (PW10Cu2@CMC) are fabricated with tunable loadings (17 to 44&#160;wt%), which can be successfully applied in indirect electrocatalytic syntheses of sulfenamides and disulfides. Specifically, the optimal PW10Cu2@CMC (44&#160;wt%) exhibits excellent electrocatalytic performance for the construction of S&#9472;N/S&#9472;S bonds (yields up to 99%) coupling with the efficient production of H2 (&#8776;50&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1). Remarkably, it enables the scale&#8208;up production (&#8776;14.4&#160;g in a batch experiment) and the obtained products can serve as rubber vulcanization accelerators with superior properties to traditional industrial rubber additives in real industrial processes. This powerful catalysis system that can simultaneously produce rubber vulcanization accelerator and H2 may inaugurate a new electrocatalytic avenue to explore polyoxometalate&#8208;based foam catalysts in electrocatalysis field.

         <title>Surface Engineering of Fluorinated Graphene Nanosheets Enables Ultrafast Lithium/Sodium/Potassium Primary Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets to construct conductive nanolayers and fast ion channels. Based on this, the DFG&#8208;N materials developed in this work achieve record&#8208;fast discharge rates and ultrahigh power densities without sacrificing energy density in both lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries, proving promising for commercial applications.








Abstract
Fluorinated carbon (CFx) is considered as a promising cathode material for lithium/sodium/potassium primary batteries with superior theoretical energy density. However, achieving high energy and power densities simultaneously remains a considerable challenge due to the strong covalency of the C&#8211;F bond in the highly fluorinated CFx. Herein, an efficient surface engineering strategy combining surface defluorination and nitrogen doping enables fluorinated graphene nanosheets (DFG&#8208;N) to possess controllable conductive nanolayers and reasonably regulated C&#8211;F bonds. The DFG&#8208;N delivers an unprecedented dual performance for lithium primary batteries with a power density of 77456&#160;W kg&#8722;1 and an energy density of 1067&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at an ultrafast rate of 50 C, which is the highest level reported to date. The DFG&#8208;N also achieves a record power density of 15 256 and 17 881&#160;W kg&#8722;1 at 10 C for sodium and potassium primary batteries, respectively. The characterization results and density functional theory calculations demonstrate that the excellent performance of DFG&#8208;N is attributed to surface engineering strategies that remarkably improve electronic and ionic conductivity without sacrificing the high fluorine content. This work provides a compelling strategy for developing advanced ultrafast primary batteries that combine ultrahigh energy density and power density.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;Doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A memcapacitive&#8208;synapse&#8208;based physical reservoir computing (RC) system is reported. The device's intrinsic property matches the dynamics of multisensory information processing. A touchless user interface (TUI) for a virtual shopping system is demonstrated, benefitting from the robustness and versatility of such a device, which is of profound implication for energy&#8208;efficient human&#8722;computer interface and edge computing apparatus.








Abstract
Hardware implementation tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but have not been experimentally exploited yet. Here, this work&#160;reports an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could originate from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium&#8208;oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8776;113.4 fJ per spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. This&#160;system is verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping based on the&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system is demonstrated, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. These&#160;results shed light on the development of highly power&#8208;efficient human&#8211;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>A Transformable Mucoadhesive Microgel Network for Noninvasive Multimodal Imaging And Radioprotection of a Large Area of the Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mucoadhesive microgel (Bi&#8208;GLUE) integrating high mucoadhesion and flowability is developed as a novel gastrointestinal (GI) modulation platform, which can cover large&#8208;area GI tracts through oral administration. The contrast&#8208;loaded Bi&#8208;GLUE achieves multimodal, large&#8208;area GI imaging that traditional contrasts cannot fulfill. Moreover, the Bi&#8208;GLUE offers a new GI&#8208;radioprotection strategy by constructing an intracorporal radiation&#8208;attenuating shield in the GI lumen.








Abstract
The lack of noninvasive imaging and modulation of a large area of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract constrain the diagnosis and treatment of many GI&#8208;related diseases. Recent advances use novel mucoadhesive materials to coat a part of the GI tract and then modulate its functions. High mucoadhesion is the key factor of the partial coating, but also the limitation for not spreading and covering the lower GI tract. Here, a bismuth&#8211;pectin organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid complex is screened and engineered into a transformable microgel network (Bi&#8208;GLUE) with high flowability and mucoadhesion, such that it&#160;can quickly transit through and coat a large area of the GI tract. In murine and porcine models, Bi&#8208;GLUE delivers contrast agents to achieve real&#8208;time, large&#8208;area GI&#8208;tract imaging under X&#8208;ray or magnetic resonance &#160;modalities and to facilitate the non&#8208;invasive diagnosis of familial adenomatous polyposis. Moreover, Bi&#8208;GLUE, like an intracorporal radiation shield, decreases the radiotoxicity in a whole&#8208;abdomen irradiation rat model. This transformable microgel network offers a new direction that can modulate a large area of the GI tract and may have broad applications for GI&#8208;related conditions.

         <title>Self&#8208;Assembly of Platelet Lysates Proteins into Microparticles by Unnatural Disulfide Bonds for Bottom&#8208;Up Tissue Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proteins from human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs) produce microparticles by forming unnatural disulfide bonds (&#8211;S&#8211;S&#8211;). In this study, protein&#8208;based microparticles are produced with defined surface topography and tunable size using a direct, simple, and low&#8208;cost methodology. These bioactive microstructures allow cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form and have applications in bottom&#8208;up approaches.








Abstract
There is a demand to design microparticles holding surface topography while presenting inherent bioactive cues for applications in the biomedical and biotechnological fields. Using the pool of proteins present in human&#8208;derived platelet lysates (PLs), the production of protein&#8208;based microparticles via a simple and cost&#8208;effective method is reported, exploring the prone redox behavior of cysteine (Cy&#8208;SH) amino acid residues. The forced formation of new intermolecular disulfide bonds results in the precipitation of the proteins as spherical, pompom&#8208;like microparticles with adjustable sizes (15&#8211;50&#160;&#181;m in diameter) and surface topography consisting of grooves and ridges. These PL microparticles exhibit extraordinary cytocompatibility, allowing cell&#8208;guided microaggregates to form, while also working as injectable systems for cell support. Early studies also suggest that the surface topography provided by these PL microparticles can support osteogenic behavior. Consequently, these PL microparticles may find use to create live tissues via bottom&#8208;up procedures or injectable tissue&#8208;defect fillers, particularly for bone regeneration, with the prospect of working under xeno&#8208;free conditions.

         <title>A Quasi&#8208;2D Polypyrrole Film with Band&#8208;Like Transport Behavior and High Charge&#8208;Carrier Mobility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first band&#8208;like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H2SO4&#8208;interface&#8208;assisted approach, a quasi&#8208;2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge&#8208;carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, attributed to the efficient band&#8208;like short&#8208;range transport in q2DPPy.








Abstract
Quasi&#8208;2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non&#8208;covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H2SO4 (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;&#8208;electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature&#8208;dependent charge&#8208;transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time&#8208;domain spectroscopy (THz&#8208;TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long&#8208;range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz&#8208;TDS reveals a band&#8208;like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short&#8208;range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1.

&lt;p&gt;The first band-like transport behavior in polypyrrole (PPy) is reported. Utilizing an air/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;-interface-assisted approach, a quasi-2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film is synthesized, formed by a layered assembly of fully extended quinoidal PPy chains. Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy at various temperatures reveals unprecedented high charge-carrier mobility up to &#8776;107.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, attributed to the efficient band-like short-range transport in q2DPPy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quasi-2D (q2D) conjugated polymers (CPs) are polymers that consist of linear CP chains assembled through non-covalent interactions to form a layered structure. In this work, the synthesis of a novel crystalline q2D polypyrrole (q2DPPy) film at the air/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (95%) interface is reported. The unique interfacial environment facilitates chain extension, prevents disorder, and results in a crystalline, layered assembly of protonated quinoidal chains with a fully extended conformation in its crystalline domains. This unique structure features highly delocalized &#960;-electron systems within the extended chains, which is responsible for the low effective mass and narrow electronic bandgap. Thus, the temperature-dependent charge-transport properties of q2DPPy are investigated using the van der Pauw (vdP) method and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The vdP method reveals that the q2DPPy film exhibits a semiconducting behavior with a thermally activated hopping mechanism in long-range transport between the electrodes. Conversely, THz-TDS reveals a band-like transport, indicating intrinsic charge transport up to a record short-range high THz mobility of &#8776;107.1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; V&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Manipulations of Spin Waves by Photoelectrons in Ferromagnetic/Non&#8208;Ferromagnetic Alloyed Film</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Natural light enabling spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40 alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully. It can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the spin wave is modulated stably, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior








Abstract
Spin waves are considered to be an alternative carrier with great promise for information sensing. The feasible excitation and low&#8208;power manipulation of spin waves still remain a challenge. In this regard, natural light enablings spin&#8208;wave tunability in Co60Al40&#8208;alloyed film is investigated. A reversible shift of the critical angle (from 81&#176; in the dark to 83&#176; under illumination) of the body spin&#8208;wave is achieved successfully Meanwhile, an eye&#8208;catching shift (817&#160;Oe) of the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) field is obtained optically, leading to changes in magnetic anisotropy. Based on the modified Puszkarski's surface inhomogeneity model, the control of spin&#8208;wave resonance (SWR) by sunlight can be understood by an effective photoelectron&#8208;doping&#8208;induced change of the surface magnetic anisotropy. Furthermore, the body spin wave is modulated stably with natural light illumination, confirming a non&#8208;volatile, reversible switching behavior. This work has both practical and theoretical importance for developing future sunlight&#8208;tunable magnonics/spintronics devices.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control LUMO Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rolling transfer of Langmuir layers of amphiphilic C60 derivatives is shown to enable the production of films with highly defined morphology. The resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies enable the establishment of a practical model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor. This allows prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.








Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the optoelectronic properties in organic films, which are crucial for their application, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here,&#160;an automated method is presented for fabricating thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extension of domain edges, both of which are used to control nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8211;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during the deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8211;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy, it is shown that the rtLL method advances the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with defined morphology. The variation in nearest&#8208;neighbor interactions is thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square&#8208;wave voltammetry) enable the establishment of a model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for the prediction of the range of accessible LUMO energies.

         <title>Supramolecular Liquid Crystal Carbon Dots for Solvent&#8208;Free Direct Ink Writing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The first case of solvent&#8208;free direct ink writing (DIW) of carbon dots is demonstrated via liquid crystallization, giving rise to highly luminescent fluorescent patterns in three primary colors of blue, green, and red, respectively, due to the significantly limited aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) effect, and promising technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.








Abstract
Recent years have witnessed the major advances of nanolights with extensive exploration of nano&#8208;luminescent materials like carbon dots (CDs). However, solvent&#8208;free processing of these materials remains a formidable challenge, impeding endeavors to develop advanced manufacturing techniques. Herein, in response to this challenge, liquid crystallization is demonstrated as a versatile and robust approach by deliberately anchoring flexible alkyl chains on the CDs surface. Alkyl chain grafting on the CDs surface is observed to substantially depress the common aggregation&#8208;caused quenching effect, and results in a shift of self&#8208;assembly structure from the crystalline phase to smectic liquid crystalline phase. The liquid&#8208;crystalline phase&#8208;transition temperature is ready to adjust by varying the alkyl chain length, endowing low&#8208;temperature (&lt;50&#160;&#176;C) melt&#8208;processing capabilities. Consequently, the first case of direct ink writing (DIW) with liquid crystal (LC) carbon dots is demonstrated, giving rise to highly emissive objects with blue, green and red fluorescence, respectively. Another unexpected finding is that DIW with the LC inks dramatically outperforms DIW with isotropic inks, further highlighting the significance of the LC processing. The approach reported herein not only exhibits a fundamental advance by imparting LC functions to CDs, but also promises technological utility in DIW&#8208;based advanced manufacturing.

         <title>Implantable, Biodegradable, and Wireless Triboelectric Devices for Cancer Therapy through Disrupting Microtubule and Actins Dynamics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An implantable, biodegradable, and wireless triboelectric device is developed for cancer therapy. The significantly enhanced tumor therapeutic effects against a broad&#8208;spectrum of tumors through cell and animal experiments are demonstrated.








Abstract
Electric&#8208;field&#8208;based stimulation is emerging as a new cancer therapeutic modality through interfering with cell mitosis. To address its limitations of complicated wire connections, bulky devices, and coarse spatial resolution, an improved and alternative method is proposed for wirelessly delivering electrical stimulation into tumor tissues through designing an implantable, biodegradable, and wirelessly controlled therapeutic triboelectric nanogenerator (ET&#8208;TENG). With the excitation of ultrasound (US) to the ET&#8208;TENG, the implanted ET&#8208;TENG can generate an alternating current voltage and concurrently release the loaded anti&#8208;mitotic drugs into tumor tissues, which synergistically disrupts the assembly of microtubules and filament actins, induces cell cycle arrest, and finally enhances cell death. With the assistance of US, the device can be completely degraded after the therapy, getting free of a secondary surgical extraction. The device can not only work around those unresectable tumors, but also provides a new application of wireless electric field in cancer therapy.

Synergistic effects of Co&#9472;N coordination and a strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior.








Abstract
The detrimental growth of lithium dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) inhibit the practical application of lithium&#8208;metal batteries. Herein, atomically dispersed cobalt coordinate conjugated bipyridine&#8208;rich covalent organic framework (sp2c&#8208;COF) is explored as an artificial SEI on the surface of the Li&#8208;metal anode to resolve these issues. The single Co atoms confined in the structure of COF enhance the number of active sites and promote electron transfer to the&#160;COF. The synergistic effects of the Co&#9472;N coordination and strong electron&#8208;withdrawing cyano&#8208;group can adsorb the electron from the donor (Co) at a maximum and create an electron&#8208;rich environment, hence further regulating the Li+ local coordination environment and achieving uniform Li&#8208;nucleation behavior. Furthermore, in situ technology and density functional theory calculations reveal the mechanism of the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co inducing Li uniform deposition and promoting Li+ rapid migration. Based on these advantages, the sp2c&#8208;COF&#8208;Co modified Li anode exhibits a low Li&#8208;nucleation barrier of 8&#160;mV, and excellent cycling stability of 6000&#160;h.

         <title>A Flexible Tough Hydrovoltaic Coating for Wearable Sensing Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A flexible tough hydrovoltaic coating with a strong structural binding effect is developed for the simultaneous achievement of good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage &#8776;3.18 V) and highly sensitive ion&#8208;sensing ability. Based on skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures, wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat is demonstrated.








Abstract
The lack of a strong binding mechanism between nanomaterials severely restricts the advantages of the evaporation&#8208;driven hydrovoltaic effect in wearable sensing electronics. It is a challenging task to observably improve the mechanical toughness and flexibility of hydrovoltaic devices to match the wearable demand without abandoning the nanostructures and surface function. Here, a flexible tough polyacrylonitrile/alumina (PAN/Al2O3) hydrovoltaic coating with both good electricity generation (open&#8208;circuit voltage, Voc&#160;&#8776;&#160;3.18&#160;V) and sensitive ion sensing (2285&#160;V&#160;M&#8722;1 for NaCl solutions in 10&#8722;4 to 10&#8722;3&#160;m) capabilities is developed. The porous nanostructure composed of Al2O3 nanoparticles is firmly locked by the strong binding effect of PAN, giving a critical binding force 4 times that of Al2O3 film to easily deal with 9.92&#160;m&#160;s&#8722;1 strong water&#8208;flow impact. Finally, skin&#8208;tight and non&#8208;contact device structures are proposed to achieve wearable multifunctional self&#8208;powered sensing directly using sweat. The flexible tough PAN/Al2O3 hydrovoltaic coating breaks through the mechanical brittleness limitation and broadens the applications of the evaporation&#8208;induced hydrovoltaic effect in self&#8208;powered wearable sensing electronics.

Integrated into a well&#8208;designed microfluidic device, it exhibits superior energy harvesting&#8211;storage performance in the body due to the synergistic effect of Au, Co nanoparticles.









Abstract
As an efficient alternative for harnessing the energy from human's biofluid, a wearable energy harvesting&#8211;storage hybrid supercapacitor&#8211;biofuel cell (SC&#8208;BFC) microfluidic system is established with one multifunctional electrode. The electrode integrates metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) derived carbon nanoarrays with embedded Au, Co nanoparticles on a flexible substrate, and is used for the symmetric supercapacitor as well as the enzyme nanocarriers of the biofuel cell. The electrochemical performance of the proposed electrode is evaluated, and the corresponding working mechanism is studied in depth according to the cyclic voltammetry and density functional theory calculation. The multiplexed microfluidic system is designed to pump and store natural sweat to maintain the continuous biofuel supply in the hybrid SC&#8208;BFC system. The biofuel cell module harvests electricity from lactate in sweat, and the symmetric supercapacitor module accommodates the bioelectricity for subsequent utilization. A numerical model is developed to validate the normal operation in poor and rich sweat under variable situations for the microfluidic system. One single SC&#8208;BFC unit can be self&#8208;charged to &#8776;0.8&#160;V with superior mechanical durability in on&#8208;body testing, as well as energy and power values of 7.2 mJ and 80.3 &#181;W, respectively. It illustrates the promising scenery of energy harvesting&#8211;storage hybrid microfluidic system.

         <title>Restraining Interfacial Cu2+ by using Amorphous SnO2 as Sacrificial Protection Boosts CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy is proposed to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 to enhance the electrocatalytic performance for CO2 electroreduction to formate. The high active interface can significantly lower the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) of the carbon dioxide reduction and enhance its selectivity and activity for formate. 








Abstract
The electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR) to formate is of great interest in the field of electrochemical energy. Cu&#8208;based material is an appealing electrocatalyst for the CO2RR. However, retaining Cu2+ under the high cathodic potential of CO2RR remains a great challenge, leading to low electrocatalytic selectivity, activity, and stability. Herein, inspired by corrosion science, a sacrificial protection strategy to stabilize interfacial crystalline CuO through embedding of active amorphous SnO2 (c&#8208;CuO/a&#8208;SnO2) is reported, which greatly boosts the electrocatalytic sensitivity, activity, and stability for CO2RR to formate. The as&#8208;made hybrid catalyst can achieve superior high selectivity for CO2RR to formate with a remarkable Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 96.7%, and a superhigh current density of over 1 A cm&#8722;2 that far outperforms industrial benchmarks (FE &gt; 90%, current density &gt; 300&#160;mA cm&#8722;2). In situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and X&#8208;ray diffractionexperimental and theoretical calculation results reveal that the broadened s&#8208;orbital in interfacial a&#8208;SnO2 offers the lower orbital for extra electrons than Cu2+, which can effectively retain nearby Cu2+, and the high active interface significantly lowers the energy barrier of the limited step (*CO2 &#8594; *HCOO) and enhances the selectivity and activity for CO2RR to formate.

         <title>Non&#8208;Blinking Luminescence from Charged Single Graphene Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Non&#8208;blinking luminescence from charged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs) is observed. This is attributed to the singly charged trion maintaining photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination. This phenomenon can be explained in terms of the different energy levels in the GQDs caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups.








Abstract
Photoluminescence blinking behavior from single quantum dots under steady illumination is an important but controversial topic. Its occurrence has impeded the use of single quantum dots in bioimaging. Different mechanisms have been proposed to account for it, although controversial, the most important of which is the non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination mechanism whereby photocharging of quantum dots can lead to the blinking phenomenon. Here, the singly charged trion, which maintains photon emission, including radiative recombination and non&#8208;radiative Auger recombination, leads to fluorescence non&#8208;blinking which is observed in photocharged single graphene quantum dots (GQDs). This phenomenon can be explained in terms of different energy levels in the GQDs, caused by various oxygen&#8208;containing functional groups in the single GQDs. The suppressed blinking is due to the filling of trap sites owing to a Coulomb blockade. These results provide a profound understanding of the special optical properties of GQDs, affording a reference for further in&#8208;depth research.

         <title>Soft&#8211;Rigid Heterostructures with Functional Cation Vacancies for Fast&#8208;Charging and High&#8208;Capacity Sodium Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The concept of a soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 heterostructure is proposed and realized in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, which is confirmed by electrochemical tests and theoretical calculations. The synergy of heterostructure and functional cation vacancies can effectively lower the mechanical stress, decrease Na+&#8208;diffusion barriers and maintain structural stability, resulting in high rate capacity and remarkable cycling performance.








Abstract
Optimizing charge transfer and alleviating volume expansion in electrode materials are critical to maximize electrochemical performance for energy&#8208;storage systems. Herein, an atomically thin soft&#8211;rigid Co9S8@MoS2 core&#8211;shell heterostructure with dual cation vacancies at the atomic interface is constructed as a promising anode for high&#8208;performance sodium&#8208;ion batteries. The dual cation vacancies involving VCo and VMo in the heterostructure and the soft MoS2 shell afford ionic pathways for rapid charge transfer, as well as the rigid Co9S8 core acting as the dominant active component and resisting structural deformation during charge&#8211;discharge. Electrochemical testing and theoretical calculations demonstrate both excellent Na+&#8208;transfer kinetics and pseudocapacitive behavior. Consequently, the soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure delivers extraordinary sodium&#8208;storage performance (389.7&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 after 500 cycles at 5.0 A g&#8722;1), superior to those of the single&#8208;phase counterparts: the assembled Na3V2(PO4)3||d&#8208;Co9S8@MoS2/S&#8208;Gr full cell achieves an energy density of 235.5&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 at 0.5 C. This finding opens up a unique strategy of soft&#8211;rigid heterostructure and broadens the horizons of material design in energy storage and conversion.

         <title>Salt&#8208;Induced High&#8208;Density Vacancy&#8208;Rich 2D MoS2&#160;for Efficient Hydrogen Evolution</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sulfur vacancy engineering is a vital strategy to activate the hydrogen evolution activity of the MoS2 basal plane. Unlike traditional costly post&#8208;treatment methods, this work demonstrates a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition method for synthesizing vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2 electrocatalysts with exceptional catalytic activity. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process.








Abstract
Emerging non&#8208;noble metal 2D&#160;catalysts, such as molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), hold great promise in hydrogen evolution reactions. The sulfur vacancy is recognized as a key defect type that can activate the inert basal plane to improve the catalytic performance. Unfortunately, the method&#160;of introducing sulfur vacancies is limited and requires costly post&#8208;treatment processes. Here, a novel salt&#8208;assisted chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method is demonstrated for synthesizing ultrahigh&#8208;density vacancy&#8208;rich 2H&#8208;MoS2, with a controllable sulfur vacancy density of up to 3.35&#160;&#215;&#160;1014&#160;cm&#8722;2. This approach involves a pre&#8208;sprayed potassium chloridepromoter on the growth substrate. The generation of such defects is closely related to ion adsorption in the growth process, the unstable MoS2&#8208;K&#8208;H2O triggers the formation of sulfur vacancies during the subsequent transfer process, and it is more controllable and nondestructive when compared to traditional post&#8208;treatment methods. The vacancy&#8208;rich monolayer MoS2 exhibits exceptional catalytic activity based on the microcell measurements, with an overpotential of &#8776;158.8&#160;mV (100&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2) and a Tafel slope of 54.3&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1 in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4 electrolyte. These results indicate a promising opportunity for modulating sulfur vacancy defects in MoS2 using salt&#8208;assisted CVD growth. This approach represents a significant leap toward achieving better control over the catalytic performances of 2D materials.

         <title>Enhanced Multiwavelength Response of Flexible Synaptic Transistors for Human Sunburned Skin Simulation and Neuromorphic Computation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible organic synaptic transistors with enhanced multiwavelength light&#8208;response properties are prepared by introducing alumina oxide (AlOX ) nanoparticles. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, a learning efficiency model, neural network computing, and &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning memory functions are successfully simulated.








Abstract
In biological species, optogenetics and bioimaging work together to regulate the function of neurons. Similarly, the light&#8208;controlled artificial synaptic system not only enhances computational speed but also simulates complex synaptic functions. However, reported synaptic properties are mainly limited to mimicking simple biological functions and single&#8208;wavelength responses. Therefore, the development of flexible synaptic devices with multiwavelength optical signal response and multifunctional simulation remains a challenge. Here, flexible organic light&#8208;stimulated synaptic transistors (LSSTs) enabled by alumina oxide (AlOX), with a simple fabrication process, are reported. By embedding AlOX nanoparticles, the excitons separation efficiency is improved, allowing for multiple wavelength responses. Optimized LSSTs can respond to multiple optical and electrical signals in a highly synaptic manner. Multiwavelength optical synaptic plasticity, electrical synaptic plasticity, sunburned skin simulation, learning efficiency model controlled by photoelectric cooperative stimulation, neural network computing, &#8220;deer&#8221; picture learning and memory functions are successfully proposed, which promote the development for future artificial intelligent systems. Furthermore, as prepared flexible transistors exhibit mechanical flexibility with bending radius down to 2.5&#160;mm and improved photosynaptic plasticity, which facilitating development of neuromorphic computing and multifunction integration systems at the device&#8208;level.

Abstract
Breast cancer is the most frequent malignancy affecting women, yet current therapeutic strategies remain ineffective for patients with late&#8208;stage or metastatic disease. Here an effective strategy is reported for treating metastatic breast cancer. Specifically, a self&#8208;assembling dendrimer nanosystem decorated with an antibody against programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) is established for delivering a small interfering RNA (siRNA) to target 3&#8208;phosphoinositide&#8208;dependent protein kinase&#8208;1 (PDK1), a kinase involved in cancer metabolism and metastasis. This nanosystem, named PPD, is designed to target PD&#8208;L1 for cancer&#8208;specific delivery of the siRNA to inhibit PDK1 and modulate cancer metabolism while promoting programmed cell death 1 (PD&#8208;1)/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;based immunotherapy. Indeed, PPD effectively generates simultaneous inhibition of PDK1&#8208;induced glycolysis and the PD&#8208;1/PD&#8208;L1 pathway&#8208;related immune response, leading to potent inhibition of tumor growth and metastasis without any notable toxicity in tumor&#8208;bearing mouse models. Collectively, these results highlight the potential use of PPD as an effective and safe tumor&#8208;targeting therapy for breast cancer. This study constitutes a successful proof of principle exploiting the intrinsic features of the tumor microenvironment and metabolism alongside a unique self&#8208;assembling dendrimer platform to achieve specific tumor targeting and siRNA&#8208;based gene silencing in combined and precision cancer therapy.

         <title>3D&#8208;Heterojunction Based on Embedded Perovskite Micro&#8208;Sized Single Crystals for Fast Photomultiplier Photodetectors with Broad/Narrowband Dual&#8208;Mode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A strategy for creating a vertical fast photomultiplier photodetector based on a 3D heterostructure of embedded perovskite microsized single crystals with a dual mode of voltage&#8208;controlled broad/narrowband switching is reported. The additional radial interface and charge separation in the 3D heterostructure effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response of the high&#8208;performance multifunctional photodetectors.








Abstract
A fast photomultiplier photodetector with a broad/narrowband dual mode is implemented using a new 3D heterostructure based on embedded perovskite micro&#8208;sized single crystals. Because the single&#8208;crystal size is smaller than the electrode size, the active layer can be divided into a perovskite microcrystalline part for charge transport and a polymer&#8208;embedded part for charge storage. This induces an additional radial interface in the 3D heterojunction structure, and allows a photogenerated built&#8208;in electric field in the radial direction, especially when the energy levels between the perovskite and embedding polymer are similar. This type of heterojunction has a small radial capacitance that can effectively reduce carrier quenching and accelerate the carrier response. By controlling the applied bias direction, up to 300&#8211;1000% external quantum efficiency (EQE) and microsecond response can be achieved not only in the wide range of ultraviolet to visible light from 320 to 550&#160;nm, but also in the narrow&#8208;band response with a full width at half minimum (FWHM) of 20&#160;nm. This shows great potential for applications in integrated multifunctional photodetectors.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in an Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A promising Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy is developed by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism and it shows an exceptionally high permeability up to 36&#160;000 at high frequency of 100 kHz. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to its low anisotropy and unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields in the nanocrystalline alloy.








Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here, a promising nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent is reported, which is producible under industrial conditions, and which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36&#160;000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25&#160;000&#160;&#177;&#160;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from the traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping nonmagnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms locally promotes the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of the nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8211;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Triiodide Attacks the Organic Cation in Hybrid Lead Halide Perovskites: Mechanism and Suppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Triiodide is formed from thermally stressed lead halide perovskites. It hydrogen bonds strongly with organic cations in these materials, and it induces, catalytically, their deprotonation leading to perovskite decomposition. A simple thiol applied to the perovskite surface interrupts the catalytic cycle, and when applied at the perovskite&#8211;hole&#8208;transport material interface, creates a surface dipole that facilitates hole injection.








Abstract
Molecular I2 can be produced from iodide&#8208;based lead perovskites under thermal stress; triiodide, I3&#8722;, is formed from this I2 and I&#8722;. Triiodide attacks protic cation MA+&#8208; or FA+&#8208;based lead halide perovskites (MA+, methylammonium; FA+, formamidinium) as explicated through solution&#8208;based nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) studies: triiodide has strong hydrogen&#8208;bonding affinity for MA+ or FA+, which leads to their deprotonation and perovskite decomposition. Triiodide is a catalyst for this decomposition that can be obviated through perovskite surface treatment with thiol reducing agents. In contrast to methods using thiol incorporation into perovskite precursor solutions, no penetration of the thiol into the bulk perovskite is observed, yet its surface application stabilizes the perovskite against triiodide&#8208;mediated thermal stress. Thiol applied to the interface between FAPbI3 and Spiro&#8208;OMeTAD (&#8220;Spiro&#8221;) prevents oxidized iodine species penetration into Spiro and thus preserves its hole&#8208;transport efficacy. Surface&#8208;applied thiol affects the perovskite work function; it ameliorates hole injection into the Spiro overlayer, thus improving device performance. It helps to increase interfacial adhesion (&#8220;wetting&#8221;): fewer voids are observed at the Spiro/perovskite interface if thiols are applied. Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) incorporating interfacial thiol treatment maintain over 80% of their initial power conversion efficiency (PCE) after 300&#160;h of 85&#160;&#176;C thermal stress.

         <title>Trivalent Europium&#8208;Doped CsCl Quantum Dots for MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cells with Inherent Bandgap through Lattice Strain Compensation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots are introduced in FAPbI3 PSCs to solve the key issues in CsxFA1&#8722;xPbI3 (Cs&#8211;FA) PSCs and simultaneously exert the talent of Cs&#8211;FA PSCs on stability, which maintains the optimal bandgap of FAPbI3 and offsets the Cs&#8208;induced local strain with a high power conversion efficiency of 24.13%.








Abstract
Cesium&#8211;formamidinium (Cs&#8211;FA) perovskites have garnered widespread interest owing to their excellent thermal&#8208; and photostability in achieving stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs). However, Cs&#8211;FA perovskite typically suffers from Cs+ and FA+ mismatches, affecting the Cs&#8211;FA morphology and lattice distortion, resulting in an enlarged bandgap (Eg). In this work, &#8220;upgraded&#8221; CsCl, Eu3+&#8208;doped CsCl quantum dots, are&#160;developed to solve the key issues in Cs&#8211;FA PSCs and also exploit the advantage of Cs&#8208;FA PSCs on stability. The introduction of Eu3+ promotes the formation of high&#8208;quality Cs&#8211;FA films by adjusting the Pb&#8211;I cluster. CsCl:Eu3+ also offsets the local strain and lattice contraction induced by Cs+, which maintains the inherent Eg of FAPbI3 and decreases the trap density. Finally, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.13% is obtained with an excellent short&#8208;circuit current density of 26.10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 . The unencapsulated devices show excellent humidity stability and&#160;storage stability, and an initial PCE of 92.2% within 500&#160;h under continuous light illumination, and bias voltage conditions is achieved. This study provides a universal strategy to address the inherent issues of Cs&#8211;FA devices and maintain the stability of MA&#8208;free PSCs to satisfy future commercial criteria.

         <title>Overcoming Water Diffusion Limitations in Hydrogels via Microtubular Graphene Networks for Soft Actuators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates bioinspired microstructured thermoresponsive hydrogels for soft actuators with enhanced actuation performance and options for both light&#8208; and electrically controlled actuation. The poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) hydrogels contain interconnected microtubular graphene networks for enhanced water transport, resulting in increased actuation dynamics and stresses without compromising the softness and mechanical stability of the hydrogel.








Abstract
Hydrogel&#8208;based soft actuators can operate in sensitive environments, bridging the gap of rigid machines interacting with soft matter. However, while stimuli&#8208;responsive hydrogels can undergo extreme reversible volume changes of up to &#8776;90%, water transport in hydrogel actuators is in general limited by their poroelastic behavior. For poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) the actuation performance is even further compromised by the formation of a dense skin layer. Here it is shown, that incorporating a bioinspired microtube graphene network into a PNIPAM matrix with a total porosity of only 5.4% dramatically enhances actuation dynamics by up to &#8776;400% and actuation stress by &#8776;4000% without sacrificing the mechanical stability, overcoming the water transport limitations. The graphene network provides both untethered light&#8208;controlled and electrically powered actuation. It is anticipated that the concept provides a versatile platform for enhancing the functionality of soft matter by combining responsive and 2D materials, paving the way toward designing soft intelligent matter.

         <title>Tuning Ligands Ratio Allows for Controlling Gold Nanocluster Conformation and Activating a Nonantimicrobial Thiol Fragrance for Effective Treatment of MRSA&#8208;Induced Keratitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By adjusting the feed ratio of two thiol ligands with different steric hindrances, the conformation of the gold nanocluster is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16, while simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into a membrane&#8208;active antibacterial nanomedicine for the effective treatment of refractory bacterial keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus.








Abstract
Bacterial keratitis is a serious ocular disease that affects millions of people worldwide each year, among which &#8776;25% are caused by Staphylococcus aureus. With the spread of bacterial resistance, refractory keratitis caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant S. aureus (MRSA) affects &#8776;120&#160;000&#8211;190&#160;000 people annually and is a significant cause of infectious blindness. Atomically precise gold nanoclusters (GNCs) recently emerged as promising antibacterial agents; although how the GNC structure and capping ligands control the antibacterial properties remains largely unexplored. In this study, by adjusting the ratio of a &#8220;bulky&#8221; thiol fragrance to a linear zwitterionic ligand, the GNC conformation is transformed from Au25(SR)18 to Au23(SR)16 species, simultaneously converting both inactive thiol ligands into potent antibacterial nanomaterials. Surprisingly, mixed&#8208;ligand capped Au23(SR)16 GNCs exhibit superior antibacterial potency compared to their monoligand counterparts. The optimal GNC is highly potent against MRSA, showing &gt;1024&#8208;fold lower minimum inhibitory concentration than the corresponding free ligands. Moreover, it displays excellent potency in treating MRSA&#8208;induced keratitis in mice with greatly accelerated corneal recovery (by approximately ninefold). Thus, this study establishes a feasible method to synthesize antibacterial GNCs by adjusting the ligand ratio to control GNC conformation and active non&#8208;antibacterial ligands, thereby greatly increasing the repertoires for combating multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections.

         <title>Insight on the Intracellular Supramolecular Assembly of DTTO: A Peculiar Example of Cell&#8208;Driven Polymorphism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Within live cells, DTTO molecules form amorphous spherical clusters which subsequently accumulate, coalesce, and lead to the formation of fibrous crystals interconnecting different cells. Remarkably, cells produce a distinctive crystalline form, that is, a bio&#8208;polymorph, which cannot be replicated outside cells. These fibers offer a new approach for artificially connecting cells and hold the potential for creating/regenerating cellular communication networks.








Abstract
The assembly of supramolecular structures within living systems is an innovative approach for introducing artificial constructs and developing biomaterials capable of influencing and/or regulating the biological responses of living organisms. By integrating chemical, photophysical, morphological, and structural characterizations, it is&#160;shown that the cell&#8208;driven assembly of 2,6&#8208;diphenyl&#8208;3,5&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;dithieno[3,2&#8208;b:2&#8242;,3&#8242;&#8208;d]thiophene&#8208;4,4&#8208;dioxide (DTTO) molecules into fibers results in the formation of a &#8220;biologically assisted&#8221; polymorphic form, hence the term bio&#8208;polymorph. Indeed, X&#8208;ray diffraction reveals that cell&#8208;grown DTTO fibers present a unique molecular packing leading to specific morphological, optical, and electrical properties. Monitoring the process of fiber formation in cells with time&#8208;resolved photoluminescence, it is&#160;established that cellular machinery is necessary for fiber production and a non&#8208;classical nucleation mechanism for their growth is postulated. These biomaterials may have disruptive applications in the stimulation and sense of living cells, but more crucially, the study of their genesis and properties broadens the&#160;understanding of life beyond the native components of cells.

         <title>Integrating Enrichment, Reduction, and Oxidation Sites in One System for Artificial Photosynthetic Diluted CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction, and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction, and the [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;COF shows excellent visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven and natural&#8208;sunlight&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion activity under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere.








Abstract
Artificial photosynthetic diluted CO2 reduction directly driven by natural sunlight is a challenging, but promising way to realize carbon&#8208;resources recycling utilization. Herein, a three&#8208;in&#8208;one photocatalytic system of CO2 enrichment, CO2 reduction and H2O oxidation sites is designed for diluted CO2 reduction. A Zn&#8208;Salen&#8208;based covalent organic framework (Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF) with oxidation and reductive sites is synthesized; then, ionic liquids (ILs) are loaded into the pores. As a result, [Emim]BF4@Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF shows a visible&#8208;light&#8208;driven CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO conversion rate of 105.88&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1 under diluted CO2 (15%) atmosphere, even superior than most photocatalysts in high concentrations CO2. Moreover, natural sunlight driven diluted CO2 reduction rate also reaches 126.51&#160;&#181;mol g&#8722;1 in 5&#160;h. Further experiments and theoretical calculations reveal that the triazine ring in the Zn&#8208;S&#8208;COF promotes the activity of H2O oxidation and CO2 reduction sites, and the loaded ILs provide an enriched CO2 atmosphere, realizing the efficient photocatalytic activity in diluted CO2 reduction.

         <title>Rationally Designing High&#8208;Performance Versatile Organic Memristors through Molecule&#8208;Mediated Ion Movements</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well&#8208;known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high&#8208;performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule&#8208;mediated ion memristors.








Abstract
Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next&#8208;generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination&#8208;groups&#8208;regulating ions have been rarely reported.

&lt;p&gt;A generalized effective strategy with a view to molecules with specific coordination-groups-regulating ions, and regulating device functions through modulation of the molecule distribution is implemented. This well-known delicate coordination reaction is introduced into a generalized robust polymer framework, leading to modulation of the tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) molecule distribution and domain separation inside the polymer framework, and then to regulation of the formed shape of the Ag conductive filaments (CFs). The work inspires novel strategies in rationally designing high-performance and multifunctional memory devices and is promising to lead broad interest in special molecule-mediated ion memristors.

&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic memory has attracted tremendous attention for next-generation electronic elements for the molecules&#8217; striking ease of structural design. However, due to them being hardly controllable and their low ion transport, it is always essential and challenge to effectively control their random migration, pathway, and duration. There are very few effective strategies, and specific platforms with a view to molecules with specific coordination-groups-regulating ions have been rarely reported. In this work, as a generalized rational design strategy, the well-known tetracyanoquinodimethane (TCNQ) is introduced with multiple coordination groups and small plane structure into a stable polymers framework to modulate Ag migration and then achieve high-performance devices with ideal productivity, low operation voltage and power, stable switching cycles, and state retention. Raman mapping demonstrates&#160;that the migrated Ag can specially coordinate with the embedded TCNQ molecules. Notably, the TCNQ molecule distribution can be modulated inside the polymer framework and regulate the memristive behaviors through controlling the formed Ag conductive filaments (CFs) as demonstrated by Raman mapping, in situ conductive atomic force microscopy (C-AFM), X-ray diffraction (XRD) and depth-profiling X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Thus the controllable molecule-mediated Ag movements show its potential in rationally designing high-performance devices and versatile functions and is enlightening in constructing memristors with molecule-mediated ion movements.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Closed&#8208;Loop Error&#8208;Correction Learning Accelerates Experimental Discovery of Thermoelectric Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A machine&#8208;learning model using error&#8208;correction learning with experimental feedback is developed to predict high&#8208;performance thermoelectric materials. Experimentally a new family of thermoelectric materials consisting of PbSe:SnSb is achieved, which exhibits large power factor at room temperature.








Abstract
The exploration of thermoelectric materials is challenging considering the large materials space, combined with added exponential degrees of freedom coming from doping and the diversity of synthetic pathways. Here, historical data is incorporated, and is updated using experimental feedback by employing error&#8208;correction learning (ECL). This is achieved by learning from prior datasets and then&#160;adapting the model to differences in synthesis and characterization that are otherwise difficult to parameterize. This strategy is thus applied to discovering thermoelectric materials, where synthesis is prioritized at temperatures &lt;300&#160;&#9675;C. A previously unexplored chemical family of thermoelectric materials, PbSe:SnSb, is documented, finding that the best candidate in this chemical family, 2 wt% SnSb doped PbSe, exhibits a power factor more than 2&#215; that of PbSe. The investigations herein reveal that a closed&#8208;loop experimentation strategy reduces the required number of experiments to find an optimized material by a factor as high as 3&#215; compared to high&#8208;throughput searches powered by state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art machine&#8208;learning (ML) models. It is also observed that this improvement is dependent on the accuracy of the ML model in a manner that exhibits diminishing returns: once a certain accuracy is reached, factors that are instead associated with experimental pathways begin to dominate trends.
