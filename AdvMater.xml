Abstract
Anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions are vital in constructing high&#8208;frequency oscillators, fast switches, and multivalued logic (MVL) devices, which hold promising potential for next&#8208;generation integrated circuit chips and telecommunication technologies. Thanks to strategic material design and device integration, anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions have demonstrated unparalleled device and circuit performance that surpasses other semiconducting material systems. This review aims to provide a comprehensive summary of the achievements in the field of anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions. First, we discuss the fundamental operating mechanisms of anti&#8208;ambipolar devices. After that, potential materials used in anti&#8208;ambipolar devices are discussed with particular attention to 2D&#8208;based, 1D&#8208;based, and organic&#8208;based heterojunctions. Next, we overview the primary device applications employing anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions, including anti&#8208;ambipolar transistors (AATs), photodetectors, frequency doublers, and synaptic devices. Furthermore, alongside the advancements in individual devices, the practical integration of these devices at the circuit level, including topics such as MVL circuits, complex logic gates, and spiking neuron circuits, is also discussed. Lastly, the present key challenges and future research directions concerning anti&#8208;ambipolar heterojunctions and their applications are also emphasized.

         <title>Mechanically Gated Transistor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Silicon&#8208;based field effect transistors (FETs) have underpinned the information revolution in the last 60 years, and there is a strong desire for new materials, devices and architectures that can help sustain the computing power in the age of big data and artificial intelligence. Inspired by the Piezo channels, we develop a mechanically gated transistor (MGT) abandoning electric gating altogether, achieving ON/OFF ratio over three orders of magnitude under a mechanical force of hundreds of nN. The two&#8208;terminal device utilizes flexoelectric polarization induced by strain gradient, which modulates the carrier concentration in a Van der Waals (vdW) structure significantly, and it mimics Piezo channels for artificial tactile perception. This simple device concept can be easily adapted in a wide range of semiconducting materials, helping promote the fusion between mechanics and electronics in a similar way as mechanobiology.

         <title>Treatment of Ruptured Wide&#8208;Necked Aneurysms Using A Microcatheter Injectable Biomaterial</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ruptured wide&#8208;neck aneurysms (WNAs), especially in a setting of coagulopathy, are associated with significant morbidity and mortality. We show that by trapping a sub&#8208;millimeter clinical catheter inside the aneurysm sac using a flow diverter stent (FDS), we can achieve instant hemostasis by filling the aneurysm sac using a novel biomaterial rescuing catastrophic bleeding in large animal models. Here, multiple formulations of a biomaterial comprising gelatin, nanoclay, and iohexol were developed, optimized, and extensively tested in vitro to select the lead candidate for further testing in vivo in rat, porcine and canine models of WNAs, including in a subset with aneurysm rupture. The catheter&#8208;injectable and x&#8208;ray visible versions of the gel embolic agent (GEA) with the optimized mechanical properties outperformed control groups, including a subset that received a clinically used liquid embolic (Onyx, Medtronic), with and without aneurysm rupture. A combinatorial approach to ruptured WNAs with GEA and FDS may change the standard of medical practice and save lives.

         <title>Photo&#8208;Induced Mechanical Cloaking of Diarylethene&#8208;Crosslinked Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The serial connection of multiple stimuli&#8208;responses in polymer architectures enables the logically conjunctive gating of functional material processes on demand. Here, a photoswitchable diarylethene (DAE) acts as crosslinker in poly(N&#8208;vinylcaprolactam) (PVCL) microgels and allows the light&#8208;induced shift of the volume phase transition temperature (VPTT). While swollen microgels below the VPTT are susceptible to force and undergo breakage&#8208;aggregation processes, collapsed microgels above the VPTT stay intact in mechanical fields induced by ultrasonication. Within a VPTT shift regime, photoswitching of the DAE transfers microgels from the swollen to the collapsed state and thereby gates their response to force as demonstrated on the light&#8208;gated activation of an embedded fluorogenic mechanophore. This photo&#8208;induced mechanical cloaking system operates on the polymer topology level and is thereby principally universally applicable.

         <title>Intermediate Phase Free &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 Perovskite via Green Solvent Assisted Perovskite Single Crystal Redissolution Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Perovskite single crystal redissolution (PSCR) strategy is highly desired for efficient formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite photovoltaics with enhanced phase purity, improved film quality, low trap&#8208;state density, and good stability. However, the phase transition and crystallization dynamics of FAPbI3 remain unclear in the PSCR process compared to the conventional fabrication from the mixing of precursor materials. In this work, a green&#8208;solvent&#8208;assisted (GSA) method is employed to synthesize centimeter&#8208;sized &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 single crystals, which serve as the high&#8208;purity precursor to fabricate perovskite films. The &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 PSCR strategy facilitates direct &#945;&#8208;phase formation and inhibits the complex intermediate phases monitored by in&#8208;situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide&#8208;angle X&#8208;ray scattering (GIWAXS). Moreover, the &#945;&#8208;phase stability is prolonged due to the relaxation of the residual lattice strain through the isotropic orientation phase growth. Consequently, the GSA&#8208;assisted PSCR strategy effectively promotes crystallization and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), which boosted the device efficiency from 22.08% to 23.92% with significantly enhanced open circuit voltage. Our findings provide deeper insight into the PSCR process in terms of its efficacy in phase formation and lattice strain release. The green low&#8208;cost solvent may also offer a new and ideal solvent candidate for large&#8208;scale production of perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>Intermittent Defect Fluctuations in Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The heterogeneous nature, local presence, and dynamic evolution of defects typically govern the ionic and electronic properties of a wide variety of functional materials. While the last 50 years have seen considerable efforts into development of new methods to identify the nature of defects in complex materials, such as the perovskite oxides, very little is known about defect dynamics and its influence on the functionality of a material. Here, we&#160; report the discovery of the intermittent behavior of point defects (oxygen vacancies) in oxide heterostructures employing X&#8208;ray Photon Correlation Spectroscopy. We&#160; observe local fluctuations between two ordered phases in strained SrCoOx with different degrees of stability of the oxygen vacancies. Ab initio&#8208;informed phase&#8208;field modeling reveals that fluctuations between the competing ordered phases are modulated by the oxygen ion / vacancy interaction energy and epitaxial strain. The results demonstrate how defect dynamics, evidenced by measurement and modeling of their temporal fluctuations, give rise to stochastic properties that now can be fully characterized using coherent x&#8208;rays, coupled for the first time to multiscale modeling in functional complex oxide heterostructures. Our&#160; study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.

Our&#160; study and its findings open new avenues for engineering the dynamical response of functional materials used in neuromorphic and electrochemical&#160;applications.&lt;/p&gt;

Abstract
Na&#8208;ion batteries have recently emerged as a promising alternative to Li&#8208;based batteries, driven by an ever&#8208;growing demand for electricity storage systems. In the present work, we&#160;propose a cobalt&#8208;free high&#8208;capacity cathode for Na&#8208;ion batteries, synthesized using a high&#8208;entropy approach. The high&#8208;entropy approach entails mixing more than five elements in a single phase; hence, obtaining the desired properties is a challenge since this involves the interplay between different elements. Here, instead of oxide, oxyfluoride is chosen to suppress oxygen loss during long&#8208;term cycling. Supplement to this, Li was&#160;introduced in the composition to obtain high configurational entropy and Na vacant sites, thus stabilizing the crystal structure, accelerating the kinetics of intercalation/deintercalation, and improving the air stability of the material. With the optimization of the cathode composition, a reversible capacity of 109 mAh g&#8722;1 (2&#8208;4&#160;V) and 144 mAh g&#8722;1 (2&#8208;4.3&#160;V) is observed in the first few cycles, along with a significant improvement in stability during prolonged cycling. Furthermore, in&#8208;situ and ex&#8208;situ diffraction studies during charging/discharging reveal that the high&#8208;entropy strategy is successful in suppressing the complex phase transition. The impressive outcomes of the present work strongly motivate the pursuit of the high&#8208;entropy approach to develop efficient cathodes for Na&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>The Synthescope: A Vision for Combining Synthesis with Atomic Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Efforts toward atom&#8208;by&#8208;atom fabrication have gathered momentum. Recent results with electron&#8208;beam manipulation illustrate a significant advance toward atomic&#8208;scale patterning. In this work, the case is made that future efforts in this direction will benefit from reconceptualizing the scanning transmission electron microscope as a combined synthesis and manipulation platform, and simple strategies to incorporate synthesis processes with existing hardware are provided.








Abstract
The scanning transmission electron microscope, a workhorse instrument in materials characterization, is being transformed into an atomic&#8208;scale material&#8208;manipulation platform. With an eye on the trajectory of recent developments and the obstacles toward progress in this field, a vision for a path toward an expanded set of capabilities and applications is provided. The microscope is reconceptualized as an instrument for fabrication and synthesis with the capability to image and characterize atomic&#8208;scale structural formation as it occurs. Further development and refinement of this approach may have substantial impact on research in microelectronics, quantum information science, and catalysis, where precise control over atomic&#8208;scale structure and chemistry of a few &#8220;active sites&#8221; can have a dramatic impact on larger&#8208;scale functionality and where developing a better understanding of atomic&#8208;scale processes can help point the way to larger&#8208;scale synthesis approaches.

         <title>Ultrastrong Ionotronic Films Showing Electrochemical Osmotic Actuation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultrastrong nanocomposite is introduced, which is formed based on the two nanoscopic building blocks: large&#8208;size 2D MXene and 1D nanocellulose with very high aspect ratio. In the wet state, the hierarchical structures of the nanocomposite provide high ionotronic conductivity and enable out&#8208;of&#8208;plane actuation with reversible giant strain reaching 85% at only 1 V.








Abstract
A multifunctional soft material with high ionic and electrical conductivity, combined with high mechanical properties and the ability to change shape can enable bioinspired responsive devices and systems. The incorporation of all these characteristics in a single material is very challenging, as the improvement of one property tends to reduce other properties. Here, a nanocomposite film based on charged, high&#8208;aspect&#8208;ratio 1D flexible nanocellulose fibrils, and 2D Ti3C2Tx MXene is presented. The self&#8208;assembly process results in a stratified structure with the nanoparticles aligned in&#8208;plane, providing high ionotronic conductivity and mechanical strength, as well as large water uptake. In hydrogel form with 20&#160;wt% liquid, the electrical conductivity is over 200 S cm&#8722;1 and the in&#8208;plane tensile strength is close to 100&#160;MPa. This multifunctional performance results from the uniquely layered composite structure at nano&#8208; and mesoscales. A new type of electrical soft actuator is assembled where voltage as low as &#177;1&#160;V resulted in osmotic effects and giant reversible out&#8208;of&#8208;plane swelling, reaching 85% strain.

         <title>Cooperative Copper Single Atom Catalyst in Two&#8208;dimensional Carbon Nitride for Enhanced CO2 Electrolysis to Methane</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Renewable electricity powered carbon dioxide (CO2) reduction (eCO2R) to high&#8208;value fuels like methane (CH4) holds the potential to close the carbon cycle at meaningful scales. However, this kinetically staggered 8&#8208;electron multistep reduction still suffers from inadequate catalytic efficiency and current density. Atomic Cu&#8208;structures can boost eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 selectivity due to enhanced intermediate binding energies (BEs) resulting from favorably shifted d&#8208;band centers. Herein, we exploit two&#8208;dimensional carbon nitride (CN) matrices, viz. Na&#8208;polyheptazine (PHI) and Li&#8208;polytriazine imides (PTI), to host Cu&#8208;N2 type single atom sites with high density (&#8764;1.5 at%), via a facile metal ion exchange process. Optimized Cu loading in nanocrystalline Cu&#8208;PTI maximizes eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 performance with Faradaic efficiency (FECH4) of &#8776;68% and a high partial current density of 348&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at a low potential of &#8208;0.84&#160;V versus RHE, surpassing the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art catalysts. Multi&#8208;Cu substituted N&#8208;appended nanopores in the CN frameworks yield thermodynamically stable quasi&#8208;dual/triple sites with large interatomic distances dictated by the pore dimensions. First&#8208;principles calculations elucidate the relative Cu&#8208;CN cooperative effects between the two matrices and how the Cu&#8208;Cu distance and local environment dictate the adsorbate BEs, density of states, and CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 energy profile landscape. The 9N pores in Cu&#8208;PTI yield cooperative Cu&#8208;Cu sites that synergistically enhance the kinetics of the rate&#8208;limiting steps in the eCO2R&#8208;to&#8208;CH4 pathway.

         <title>Geometric Control And Optical Properties of Intrinsically Chiral Plasmonic Nanomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials exhibit intriguing geometry&#8208;dependent chiroptical properties, which is due to the combination of plasmonic features with geometric chirality. Thus, chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have become promising candidates for applications in biosensing, asymmetric catalysis, biomedicine, photonics, etc. Recent advances in geometric control and optical tuning of intrinsically chiral plasmonic nanomaterials have further opened up a unique opportunity for their widespread applications in many emerging technological areas. Here, we review the recent developments in the geometric control of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials with special attention given to the quantitative understanding of the chiroptical structure&#8208;property relationship. We also discuss several important optical spectroscopic tools for characterizing the optical chirality of plasmonic nanomaterials at both ensemble and single&#8208;particle levels. We further highlight three emerging applications of chiral plasmonic nanomaterials including enantioselective sensing, enantioselective catalysis, and biomedicine. We envision that these advanced studies in chiral plasmonic nanomaterials will pave the way toward the rational design of chiral nanomaterials with desired optical properties for diverse emerging technological applications.

         <title>Synchronous and Fully Steerable Active Particle Systems for Enhanced Mimicking of Collective Motion in Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The collective motion observed in living active matter, such as fish schools and bird flocks, is characterized by its dynamic and complex nature, involving various moving states and transitions. By tailoring physical interactions or incorporating information exchange capabilities, inanimate active particles can exhibit similar behavior. However, the lack of synchronous and arbitrary control over individual particles hinders their use as a test system for the study of more intricate collective motions in living species. Herein, we propose a novel optical feedback control system that enables the mimicry of collective motion observed in living objects using active particles. This system allows for the experimental investigation of the velocity alignment, a seminal model of collective motion (known as the Vicsek model), in a microscale perturbed environment with controllable and realistic conditions. We observe the spontaneous formation of different moving states and dynamic transitions between these states. Additionally, we quantitatively validate the high robustness of the active&#8208;particle group at the critical density under the influence of different perturbations. Our findings support the effectiveness of velocity alignment in real perturbed environments, thereby providing a versatile platform for fundamental studies on collective motion and the development of innovative swarm microrobotics.

         <title>Ultrahigh&#8208;Speed Aqueous Copper Electrodes Stabilized by Phosphorylated Interphase</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
High&#8208;energy metal anodes for large&#8208;scale reversible batteries with inexpensive and non&#8208;flammable aqueous electrolytes promise the capability of supporting higher current density, satisfactory lifetime, non&#8208;toxicity, and low&#8208;cost commercial manufacturing, yet remain out of reach due to the lack of reliable electrode&#8208;electrolyte interphase engineering. Herein, we demonstrate in situ formed robust interphase on copper metal electrodes (CMEs) induced by a trace amount of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (0.05&#160;M in 1&#160;M CuSO4&#8208;H2O electrolyte) to fulfill all aforementioned requirements. Impressively, an unprecedented ultrahigh&#8208;speed copper plating/stripping capability is achieved at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2&#160;for over 12000 cycles, corresponding to an accumulative areal capacity up to tens of times higher than previously reported CMEs. The use of SEI&#8208;protection strategy brings at least an order of magnitude improvement in cycling stability for symmetric cells (Cu||Cu, 2800&#160;h) and full batteries with CMEs using either sulfur cathodes (S||Cu, 1000 cycles without capacity decay) or zinc anodes (Cu||Zn with all&#8208;metal electrodes, discharge voltage &#8764;1.02&#160;V). The comprehensive analysis reveals that the hydrophilic phosphate&#8208;rich interphase nanostructures homogenized copper&#8208;ion deposition and suppressed nucleation overpotential, enabling dendrite&#8208;free CMEs with sustainability and ability to tolerate unusual&#8208;high power densities. Our findings represent an&#160;elegant&#160;forerunner&#160;toward the promising goal of metal electrode applications.

         <title>All&#8208;Optical Data Processing with Photon Avalanching Nanocrystalline Photonic Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Data processing and storage in electronic devices are typically performed as a sequence of elementary binary operations. Alternative approaches, such as neuromorphic or reservoir computing, are rapidly gaining interest where data processing is relatively slow, but can be performed in a more comprehensive way or massively in parallel, like in neuronal circuits. Here we discover time&#8208;domain all&#8208;optical information processing capabilities of photon avalanching (PA) nanoparticles at room temperature. Demonstrated functionality resembles properties found in neuronal synapses, such as: paired&#8208;pulse facilitation and short&#8208;term internal memory, in&#8208;situ plasticity, multiple inputs processing, and all&#8208;or&#8208;nothing threshold response. The PA memory&#8208;like behavior shows capability of machine&#8208;learning&#8208;algorithms&#8208;free feature extraction and further recognition of 2D patterns with simple 2 input artificial neural network (ANN). Additionally, high&#8208;nonlinearity of luminescence intensity in response to photoexcitation mimics and enhances spike&#8208;timing&#8208;dependent plasticity that is coherent in nature with the way a sound source is localized in animals neuronal circuits. Not only yet unexplored fundamental properties of photon avalanche luminescence kinetics are studied, but our approach, combined with recent achievements in photonics, light confinement and guiding, promises all&#8208;optical data processing, control, adaptive responsivity and storage on photonic chips.

         <title>Obviating Ligand Exchange Preserves the Intact Surface of HgTe Colloidal Quantum Dots and Enhances Performance of Short Wavelength Infrared Photodetectors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
A large volume, scalable, synthesis procedure of HgTe quantum dots (QDs) capped initially with short&#8208;chain conductive ligands, ensures ligand exchange&#8208;free and simple device fabrication. An effective n&#8208; or p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping of HgTe QDs is achieved by varying the cation&#8208;anion ratio, as well as shifting the Fermi level position by introducing single&#8208; or double&#8208;cyclic thiol ligands, i.e., 2&#8208;furanmethanethiol (FMT) or 2,5&#8208;dimercapto&#8208;3,4&#8208;thiadiasole (DMTD) in the synthesis. This allows for the preservation of the intact surface of the HgTe QDs, thus ensuring a one order of magnitude reduced surface trap density compared with HgTe subjected to solid&#8208;state ligand exchange. The charge carrier diffusion length can be extended from 50 to 90&#160;nm when the device active area consists of a bi&#8208;layer of cation&#8208;rich HgTe QDs capped with DMTD and FMT respectively. As a result, the responsivity under 1340&#160;nm illumination is boosted to 1 AW&#8722;1 at zero bias and up to 40 AW&#8722;1 under &#8208;1&#160;V bias at room temperature. Due to high noise current density, the specific detectivity of these photodetectors&#8217; reaches up to 1010 Jones at room temperature and under inert atmosphere. Meanwhile, high photoconductive gain ensures a rise in the external quantum efficiency of up to 1000% under reverse bias.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Amorphous Iron Selenide Sulfide Nanosheets for Stable and Rapid Sodium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Sodium ion batteries (SIBs) suffer from large electrode volume change and sluggish redox kinetics for the relatively large ionic radius of sodium ions, raising a significant challenge to improve their long&#8208;term cyclability and rate capacity. Here, we propose to apply a two&#8208;dimensional (2D) amorphous iron selenide sulfide nanosheets (a&#8208;FeSeS NSs) as an anode material for SIBs, and demonstrate that they exhibit remarkable rate capability of 528.7 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 A g&#8722;1 and long&#8208;life cycle (10000 cycles) performance (300.4 mAh g&#8722;1). This performance is much more superior to that of the previously reported Fe&#8208;based anode materials, which is attributed to their amorphous structure that alleviates volume expansion of electrode, 2D nature that facilitates electrons/ions transfer, and the S/Se double anions that offer more reaction sites and stabilize the amorphous structure. Such a 2D amorphous strategy provides a fertile platform for structural engineering of other electrode materials, making a more secure energy prospect closer to a reality.

         <title>Tailoring the Weight of Surface and Intralayer Edge States to Control Lumo Energies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the electronic and optical properties in organic films, which is crucial for their application as organic semiconductor materials, e.g., in organic solar cells, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study in thin films due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here &#160;we present an automated method for fabricating layered thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extent of domain edges within the layers, both of which &#160;we use to control nearest neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir&#8208;Schaefer&#8208;type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;&#8208;conjugated molecules. Using UV&#8208;vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy &#160;we show that the rtLL method significantly advanced the deposition of multi&#8208;Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with highly defined morphology. The variation in nearest neighbor interactions thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square wave voltammetry) enabled us to establish a handy model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The energies of the frontier molecular orbitals determine the electronic and optical properties in organic films, which is crucial for their application as organic semiconductor materials, e.g., in organic solar cells, and strongly depend on the morphology and supramolecular structure. The impact of the latter two properties on the electronic energy levels relies primarily on nearest neighbor interactions, which are difficult to study in thin films due to their nanoscale nature and heterogeneity. Here &#160;we present an automated method for fabricating layered thin films with a tailored ratio of surface to bulk sites and a controlled extent of domain edges within the layers, both of which &#160;we use to control nearest neighbor interactions. This method uses a Langmuir-Schaefer-type rolling transfer of Langmuir layers (rtLL) to minimize flow during deposition of rigid Langmuir layers composed of &#960;-conjugated molecules. Using UV-vis absorption spectroscopy, atomic force and transmission electron microscopy &#160;we show that the rtLL method significantly advanced the deposition of multi-Langmuir layers and enables the production of films with highly defined morphology. The variation in nearest neighbor interactions thus achieved and the resulting systematically tuned lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) energies (determined via square wave voltammetry) enabled us to establish a handy model that functionally relates the LUMO energies to a morphological descriptor, allowing for prediction of the range of experimentally accessible LUMO energies.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Microfibrous Scaffolds Guide Stem Cell Lumenogenesis and Brain Organoid Engineering</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
3D organoids have been widely used as tractable in vitro models capable of elucidating aspects of human development and disease. However, the manual and low throughput culture methods coupled with a low reproducibility and geometric heterogeneity restricts the scope and application of organoid research. Combining expertise from stem cell biology and bioengineering offers a promising approach to address some of these limitations. Here, we use melt electrospinning writing to generate tuneable grid scaffolds that can guide the self&#8208;organization of pluripotent stem cells into patterned arrays of embryoid bodies. We show that grid geometry is a key determinant of stem cell self&#8208;organization, guiding the position and size of emerging lumens via curvature&#8208;controlled tissue growth. We report two distinct methods for culturing scaffold&#8208;grown embryoid bodies into either interconnected or spatially discrete cerebral organoids. These scaffolds provide a high&#8208;throughput method to generate, culture and analyse large numbers of organoids, substantially reducing the time investment and manual labour involved in conventional methods of organoid culture. We anticipate that this methodological development will open up new opportunities for guiding pluripotent stem cell culture, studying lumenogenesis, and generating large numbers of uniform organoids for high throughput screening.

         <title>Power&#8208;Efficient Multisensory Reservoir Computing Based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 Memcapacitive Synapse Arrays</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Hardware implementations tailored to requirements in reservoir computing would facilitate lightweight and powerful temporal processing. Capacitive reservoirs would boost power efficiency due to their ultralow static power consumption but haven't been experimentally exploited yet. Here we&#160;report an oxide&#8208;based memcapacitive synapse (OMC) based on Zr&#8208;doped HfO2 (HZO) for a power&#8208;efficient and multisensory processing reservoir computing system. The nonlinearity and state richness required for reservoir computing could be originated from the capacitively coupled polarization switching and charge trapping of hafnium oxide&#8208;based devices. The power consumption (&#8764;113.4 fJ/spike) and temporal processing versatility outperform most resistive reservoirs. Our&#160;system has been verified by common benchmark tasks, and it exhibits high accuracy (&gt;94%) in recognizing multisensory information, including acoustic, electrophysiological, and mechanic modalities. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, a touchless user interface for virtual shopping is demonstrated based on our&#160;OMC&#8208;based reservoir computing system, benefiting from its interference&#8208;robust acoustic and electrophysiological perception. Our&#160;results would shed light on the development of high power&#8208;efficient human&#8208;machine interfaces and machine&#8208;learning platforms.

         <title>Hapten/Myristoyl Functionalized Poly(Propylene IMINE) Dendrimers as Potent Cell Surface Recruiters of Antibodies for Mediating Innate Immune Killing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Recruiting endogenous antibodies to the surface of cancer cells using antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules has the potential to unleash innate immune effector killing mechanisms against antibody&#8208;bound cancer cells. However, the affinity of endogenous antibodies is relatively low, and many currently explored antibody&#8208;recruiting strategies rely on targeting over&#8208;expressed receptors, which have not yet been identified in most solid tumors. In this study, we aimed to address both challenges by functionalizing poly(propyleneimine) (PPI) dendrimers with both multiple dinitrophenyl (DNP) motifs, as anti&#8208;hapten antibody&#8208;recruiting motifs, and myristoyl motifs, as universal phospholipid cell membrane anchoring motifs, to recruit anti&#8208;hapten antibodies to cell surfaces. By exploiting the multivalency of the ligand exposure on the dendrimer scaffold, we demonstrated that dendrimers featuring ten myristoyl and six DNP motifs exhibited the highest antibody&#8208;recruiting capacity in vitro. Furthermore, we showed that treating cancer cells with these dendrimers in vitro marked them for phagocytosis by macrophages in the presence of anti&#8208;hapten antibodies. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, we showed that intratumoral injection of these dendrimers in vivo in tumor&#8208;bearing mice, resulted in the recruitment of anti&#8208;DNP antibodies to the surface of cells in the tumor microenvironment. Our findings highlight the potential of dendrimers as a promising class of novel antibody&#8208;recruiting molecules for use in cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Extensible Integrated System for Real&#8208;Time Monitoring of Cardiovascular Physiological Signals And Limb Health</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
In recent decades, the rapid growth in flexible materials, new manufacturing technologies, and wearable electronics design techniques has help establish the foundations for noninvasive photoelectric sensing systems with shape&#8208;adaptability and &#8220;skin&#8208;like&#8221; properties. Physiological sensing includes humidity, mechanical, thermal, photoelectric, and other aspects. Photoplethysmography (PPG), an important non&#8208;invasive method for measuring pulse rate, blood pressure and blood oxygen, uses the attenuated signal obtained by the light absorbed and reflected from living tissue to a light source to realize real&#8208;time monitoring of human health status. Our work illustrates a patch&#8208;type optoelectronic system that integrates a flexible perovskite photodetector and all&#8208;inorganic light&#8208;emitting diodes to realize the real&#8208;time monitoring of human PPG signals. The pulse rate of the human body and the swelling degree of finger joints can be extracted and analyzed using photodetectors, thus monitoring human health for the prevention and early diagnosis of certain diseases. Specifically, we developed a 3D wrinkled&#8208;serpentine interconnection wire that increased the shape adaptability of the device in practical applications. The PPG signal sensor reported in this study has considerable potential for future wearable intelligent medical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance n&#8208;Type Polymeric Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors: The Impacts of Halogen Functionalization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymer mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (PMIECs) is a grand challenge, which largely determines their applications in organic electronic devices based on logic circuits and p&#8208;n junctions, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) and organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, we report two halogen&#8208;functionalized PMIECs f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF and f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl built from fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2) bearing branched oligo(ethylene glycol) side chain as the acceptor unit and halogenated thienylene&#8211;vinylene&#8211;thienylene (TVT) as the donor co&#8208;unit. Compared to the control polymer f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT, the fluorinated f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF shows lower&#8208;positioned LUMO, improved charge transport property, and greater ion uptake capacity. As a result, f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF delivers a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art &#956;C* of 90.2 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 with a remarkable electron mobility of 0.41 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 in OECTs and an excellent power factor of 64.2 &#956;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;2 in OTEs, higher than those of f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTCl and parent f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVT. Using f&#8208;BTI2g&#8208;TVTF, we further demonstrate an OECT&#8208;based inverter amplifier with voltage gain up to 148&#160;V V&#8722;1, which is among the highest values for OECT inverters. Such results shed light on the impacts of halogen atoms for developing high&#8208;performing n&#8208;type PMIECs and pave the way for realizing highly efficient n&#8208;type OECT and OTE devices.

         <title>The Electrical Behaviors of Grain Boundaries in Polycrystalline Optoelectronic Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Polycrystalline optoelectronic materials are widely used for photoelectric signal conversion and energy harvesting, and play an irreplaceable role in the semiconductor field. As an important factor in determining the optoelectronic properties of polycrystalline materials, grain boundaries (GBs) have been the focus of research. Particular emphases have been placed on the generation and height of GB barriers, how carriers move at GBs, whether GBs act as carrier transport channels or recombination sites, and how to change the device performance by altering the electrical behaviors of GBs. This review introduces the evolution of GB theory and experimental observation history, classifies GB electrical behaviors from the perspective of carrier dynamics, summarizes carrier transport state under the external conditions such as bias and illumination and the related band bending. Then the carrier scattering at GBs and the electrical differences between GBs and twin boundaries are discussed. Lastly, the review describes how the electrical behaviors of GBs can be influenced and modified by treatments such as passivation or by consciously adjusting the distribution of grain boundary elements. By studying the carrier dynamics and the relevant electrical behaviors of GBs in polycrystalline materials, researchers can develop optoelectronics with higher performance.

         <title>Genetically Encoded Oligomerization for Protein&#8208;Based Lighting Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Implementing proteins in optoelectronics represents a fresh idea towards a sustainable new class of materials with bio&#8208;functions that can replace environmentally unfriendly and/or toxic components without losing device performance. However, their native activity (fluorescence, catalysis, etc.) is easily lost under device fabrication/operation as non&#8208;native environments (organic solvents, organic/inorganic interfaces, etc.) and severe stress (temperature, irradiation, etc.) are involved. Herein, we showcase a gift bow genetically&#8208;encoded macro&#8208;oligomerization strategy to promote protein&#8208;protein solid interaction enabling i) high versatility with arbitrary proteins, ii) straightforward electrostatic driven control of the macro&#8208;oligomer size by ionic strength, and iii) stabilities over months in pure organic solvents and stress scenarios, allowing to integrate them into classical water&#8208;free polymer&#8208;based materials/components for optoelectronics. Indeed, rainbow&#8208;/white&#8208;emitting protein&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes were fabricated, attesting a first&#8208;class performance compared to those with their respective native proteins: significantly enhanced device stabilities from a few minutes up to 100&#160;h keeping device efficiency at high power driving conditions. Thus, the oligomerization concept is a solid bridge between biological systems and materials/components to meet expectations in bio&#8208;optoelectronics, in general, and lighting schemes, in particular.

         <title>Crystallization Control for Ambient Printed FA&#8208;Based Lead Triiodide Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Upscalable printing of high&#8208;performance and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is highly desired for commercialization. However, the efficiencies of printed PSCs lag behind those of their lab&#8208;scale spin&#8208;coated counterparts owing to the lack of systematic understanding and control over perovskite crystallization dynamics. Here, we report the controlled crystallization dynamics achieved using an additive 1&#8208;butylpyridine tetrafluoroborate (BPyBF4) for high&#8208;quality ambient printed &#945;&#8208;formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite films. Using in situ grazing&#8208;incidence wide angle X&#8208;ray scattering and optical diagnostics, we demonstrate the spontaneous formation of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3 and sol&#8208;gel from precursors during printing without the involvement of &#160;&#948;&#8208;FAPbI3. The addition of BPyBF4 delays the crystallization onset of &#945;&#8208;FAPbI3, enhances the conversion from sol&#8208;gel to perovskite, and reduces stacking defects during printing. Therefore, the altered crystallization results in fewer voids, larger grains, and less trap&#8208;induced recombination loss within printed films. The printed PSCs yield high power conversion efficiencies of 23.50% and 21.60% for 0.09 cm2&#8208;area devices and 5&#160;cm &#215; 5&#160;cm&#8208;area modules, respectively. Improved device stability is further demonstrated, i.e., approximately 94% of the initial efficiency is retained for over 2400&#160;h under ambient conditions without encapsulation. This study provides an effective crystallization control method for the ambient printing manufacture of large&#8208;area high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Ion&#8208;Diode&#8208;Like Heterojunction for Improving Electricity Generation from Water Droplets by Capillary Infiltration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
To improve the continuous power generation from water droplets by capillary infiltration, an Al2O3/PVDF based hydrovoltaic electricity generator with an ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like heterojunction is developed. With a drop of water, this device can generate a peak short&#8208;circuit current density of 160 &#181;A cm&#8722;2, an open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.7 V, and an accumulated charge of 60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s.








Abstract
Water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based electricity generators are emerging hydrovoltaic technologies that harvest energy from water circulation through strong interactions between water and nanomaterials. However, such devices exhibit poor current performance owing to their unclear driving force (evaporation or infiltration) and undesirable reverse diffusion current. Herein, a water&#8208;droplet&#8208;based hydrovoltaic electricity generator induced by capillary infiltration with an asymmetric structure composed of a diode&#8208;like heterojunction formed by negatively and positively charged materials is fabricated. This device can generate current densities of 160 and 450&#160;&#181;A cm&#8722;2 at room temperature and 65 &#176;C, respectively. The heterojunction achieves a rectification ratio of 12, which effectively suppresses the reverse current caused by concentration differences. This results in an improved charge accumulation of &#8776;60 mC cm&#8722;2 in 1000 s, which is three times the value observed in the control device. When the area of the device is increased to 6 cm2, the current increases linearly to 1&#160;mA, thus demonstrating the scale&#8208;up potential of the generator. It has been proven that the streaming potential originates from&#160;capillary infiltration, and the presence of ion rectification. The proposed method of constructing ion&#8208;diode&#8208;like structures provides a new strategy for improving generator performance.

         <title>Self&#8208;Induced Dual&#8208;Layered Solid Electrolyte Interphase with High Toughness and High Ionic Conductivity for Ultra&#8208;Stable Lithium Metal Batteries</title>

Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal is considered as one of the most promising candidates of anode material for high&#8208;specific&#8208;energy batteries, while irreversible chemical reactions always occur on the Li surface to continuously consume active Li, electrolyte. Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer has been regarded as the key component in protecting Li metal anode. Herein, we construct a controllable dual&#8208;layered SEI for Li metal anode in a scalable, low&#8208;lost manner. The SEI is self&#8208;induced by the pre&#8208;deposited LiAlO2 (LAO) layer during the initial cycles, in which the outer organic layer is produced due to the electrons tunnelling through LAO, resulting in the reduction of electrolyte. The robust inner LAO layer can promote uniform Li deposition owing to its favorable mechanical strength, ionic conductivity, the outer organic layer can further improve the stability of SEI. Benefiting from the remarkable effects of this dual&#8208;layered SEI, enhanced electrochemical performance of LAO&#8208;Li anode is achieved. Additionally, a large&#8208;size LAO&#8208;Li sample can be easily obtained, the preparation of the modified Li metal anode shows huge potential for large&#8208;scale production. This work highlights the tremendous potential of this self&#8208;induced dual&#8208;layered SEI for the commercialization of Li metal anode.

Solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) layer has been regarded as the key component in protecting Li metal anode. Herein, we construct a controllable dual-layered SEI for Li metal anode in a scalable, low-lost manner. The SEI is self-induced by the pre-deposited LiAlO2 (LAO) layer during the initial cycles, in which the outer organic layer is produced due to the electrons tunnelling through LAO, resulting in the reduction of electrolyte.

         <title>Spin&#8208;Orbit Torques and Spin Hall Magnetoresistance Generated by Twin&#8208;Free and Amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1 Topological Insulator Films</title>

Abstract
Topological insulators have attracted great interest as generators of spin&#8208;orbit torques (SOTs) in spintronic devices. Bi1 &#8722; xSbx is a prominent topological insulator that has a high charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency. However, the origin and magnitude of the SOTs induced by current&#8208;injection in Bi1 &#8722; xSbx remain controversial. Here we report the investigation of the SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance resulting from charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in twin&#8208;free epitaxial layers of Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) coupled to FeCo, and compare it with that of amorphous Bi0.9Sb0.1. We find a large charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion efficiency of 1 in the first case and less than 0.1 in the second, confirming crystalline Bi0.9Sb0.1 as a strong spin injector material. The SOTs and spin Hall magnetoresistance are independent of the direction of the electric current, indicating that charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion in single&#8208;crystal Bi0.9Sb0.1(0001) is isotropic despite the strong anisotropy of the topological surface states. Further, we find that the damping&#8208;like SOT has a non&#8208;monotonic temperature dependence with a minimum at 20&#160;K. By correlating the SOT with resistivity and weak antilocalization measurements, we conclude that charge&#8208;spin conversion occurs via thermally&#8208;excited holes from the bulk states above 20&#160;K, and conduction through the isotropic surface states with increasing spin polarization due to decreasing electron&#8208;electron scattering below&#160;20&#160;K.

         <title>Unmasking Chemokine&#8208;Inducing Specificity in Oligosaccharide Biomaterial to Promote Hair Growth</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Hair loss affects over 50 million people worldwide with limited therapeutic options. Despite evidence highlighting the vital role of local immune cells in regulating the life cycle of hair follicles (HFs), accurate regulation of immunocytes to directly promote hair growth remains unachieved. Here, inspired by the physiological feedback in the skin immunity to suppress microbe&#8208;triggered inflammation, we develop an oligosaccharide biomaterial with &#8220;unmasked&#8221; specific activity to recruit Treg cells around HFs, leading to accelerated hair growth in mice. By processing the glucomannan polysaccharide via controllable enzymatic cleavage, we obtain a series of oligosaccharide fractions with more specific chemokine&#8208;inducing functions. Notably, a hexasaccharide&#8208;based fraction (OG6) stimulates macrophages to selectively express Treg&#8208;chemoattractant CCL5 through a mannose receptor&#8208;mediated endocytosis and NOD1/2&#8208;dependent signaling, as evidenced by molecular docking, inhibition assays, and a Foxp3&#8208;reporter mouse model. Intradermal delivery of OG6 to the depilated mouse skin promotes Treg mobilization around HFs and stimulates de novo regeneration of robust hairs. Our study demonstrates that unmasking precise immunomodulatory functions in oligosaccharides from their parental polysaccharide can potentially solve the long&#8208;lasting dilemma with polysaccharide biomaterials that are widely renowned for versatile activities yet high heterogeneity, opening new avenues to designing glycan&#8208;based therapeutic tools with improved specificity and safety.

         <title>Progress in Hemoperfusion Adsorbents of Common Toxins in Liver and Kidney Failure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Liver and kidney failure can lead to extensive accumulation of toxic metabolites in the blood and tissues, such as bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea, which aggravate the progression of the disease. Hemoperfusion can effectively adsorb and remove toxins from the blood and treat liver and kidney failure. However, the adsorption efficiency and safety of traditional hemoperfusion adsorbents are not ideal. Thus, it is urgent to develop new toxin adsorbents with good blood compatibility, as well as high adsorption and strong selective capacities, to fulfill the growing clinical needs. In recent years, new hemoperfusion adsorption materials that can improve the adsorption performance of blood toxins while maintaining good blood compatibility have been developed, with promising potential for clinical applications. This review classifies and summarizes the recent research progress in hemoperfusion adsorbents for common blood toxins (bilirubin, blood ammonia, endotoxins, cytokines, creatinine, uric acid, and urea) produced by liver and kidney failure. The composition and structure of various toxin adsorbents, toxin adsorption performance, biocompatibility, blood safety, and the mechanisms of toxin adsorption are discussed. Based on a summary of recent studies, feasible strategies have been explored for designing and preparing hemoperfusion adsorbents to fulfill future development requirements. The trends and clinical application prospects of various toxin adsorbents are also discussed.

         <title>Rational Designs of Biomaterials for Combating Oral Biofilm Infections</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oral biofilms, which are also known as dental plaque, are the culprit of a wide range of oral diseases and systemic diseases, thus contributing to serious health risks. The manner of how to achieve good control of oral biofilms has been an increasing public concern. Novel antimicrobial biomaterials with highly controllable fabrication and functionalization have been proven to be promising candidates. However, previous reviews have generally emphasized the physicochemical properties, action mode, and application effectiveness of those biomaterials, whereas insufficient attention has been given to the design rationales tailored to different infection types and application scenarios. To offer guidance for better diversification and functionalization of anti&#8208;oral&#8208;biofilm biomaterials, this review details the up&#8208;to&#8208;date design rationales in three aspects: the core strategies in combating oral biofilm, as well as the biomaterials with advanced antibiofilm capacity and multiple functions based on the improvement or combination of the abovementioned antimicrobial strategies. Thereafter, insights on the existing challenges and future improvement of biomaterial&#8208;assisted oral biofilm treatments are proposed, hoping to provide a theoretical basis and reference for the subsequent design and application of antibiofilm biomaterials.

         <title>Anchoring &#928;&#8208;D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks with Dual&#8208;Active Centers on Carbon Nanotubes for Advanced Potassium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

Abstract
Potassium&#8208;ion batteries (PIBs) are gradually gaining attention owing to their natural abundance, excellent security, and high energy density. However, developing excellent organic cathode materials for PIBs to overcome the poor cycling stability and slow kinetics caused by the large radii of K+ ions is challenging. This study demonstrates for the first time the application of a hexaazanonaphthalene (HATN)&#8208;based two&#8208;dimensional &#960;&#8208;d conjugated metal&#8208;organic framework (2D c&#8208;MOF) with dual&#8208;active centers (Cu&#8208;HATNH) and integrates Cu&#8208;HATNH with carbon nanotubes (Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT) as the cathode material for PIBs. Owing to this systematic module integration and more exposed active sites with high utilization, Cu&#8208;HATNH@CNT exhibited a high initial capacity (317.5&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.1 A g&#8722;1), excellent long&#8208;term cycling stability (capacity retention of 96.8% at 5 A g&#8722;1 after 2200 cycles), and outstanding rate capacity (147.1&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 10 A g&#8722;1). The reaction mechanism and performance &#160;were determined by combining experimental characterization and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This contribution provides new opportunities for designing high&#8208;performance 2D c&#8208;MOF cathodes with multiple active sites for PIBs.

Skin Electronics Provides Remarkable Opportunities for Non&#8208;Invasive And Long&#8208;Term Monitoring of A Wide Variety of Biophysical And Physiological Signals that Are Closely Related to Health, Medicine, And Human&#8208;Machine Interactions. Nevertheless, Conventional Skin Electronics Fabricated on Elastic Thin Films Are Difficult to Adapt to The Wet Microenvironments of The Skin: Elastic Thin Films Are Non&#8208;Permeable, Which Blocks The Skin Perspiration; Elastic Thin Films Are Difficult to Adhere to Wet Skins; Most Skin Electronics Are Difficult to Work Underwater. Here, We Report A Wet&#8208;Adaptive Electronic Skin (WADE&#8208;skin), Which Consists of A Next&#8208;To&#8208;Skin Wet&#8208;Adhesive Fibrous Layer, A Next&#8208;To&#8208;Air Waterproof Fibrous Layer, And A Stretchable And Permeable Liquid Metal Electrode Layer. While The Electronic Functionality Is Determined by The Electrode Design, This WADE&#8208;skin Simultaneously Offers Superb Stretchability, Wet Adhesion, Permeability, Biocompatibility, And Waterproof Property. The WADE&#8208;skin Can Rapidly Adhere to Human Skin After Contact for A Few Seconds And Stably Maintain The Adhesion Over Weeks Even Under Wet Conditions, Without Showing Any Negative Effect to The Skin Health. We Demonstrate The Use of WADE&#8208;skin for The Stable Recording of Electrocardiogram During Intensive Sweating as Well as Underwater Activities, And as The Strain Sensor for The Underwater Operation of Virtual Reality&#8208;Mediated Human&#8208;Machine Interactions.

         <title>Emerging Bioprinting for Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Bioprinting has attracted much attention due to its suitability for fabricating biomedical devices. In particular, bioprinting has become one of the growing centres in the field of wound healing, with various types of bioprinted devices being developed, including 3D scaffolds, microneedle patches and flexible electronics. Bioprinted devices can be designed with specific biostructures and biofunctions that closely match the shape of wound sites and accelerate the regeneration of skin through various approaches. Herein, a comprehensive review of the bioprinting of smart wound dressings (SWDs) is presented, emphasizing the crucial effect of bioprinting in determining biostructures and biofunctions. The review begins with an overview of bioprinting techniques and bioprinted devices, followed with an in&#8208;depth discussion of polymer&#8208;based inks, modification strategies, additive ingredients, properties and applications. The strategies for the modification of bioprinted devices are divided into 7 categories, including chemical synthesis of novel inks, physical blending, coaxial bioprinting, multi&#8208;material bioprinting, physical absorption, chemical immobilization, and hybridization with living cells, and examples are presented. Thereafter, the frontiers of bioprinting and wound healing, including 4D bioprinting, artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;assisted bioprinting, and in situ bioprinting, are discussed from a perspective of interdisciplinary sciences. Finally, the current challenges and future prospects in this field are highlighted.

         <title>Boosting Dye&#8208;Sensitized Luminescence by Enhanced Short&#8208;Range Triplet Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Dye&#8208;sensitization can enhance lanthanide&#8208;based upconversion luminescence, but is hindered by interfacial energy transfer from organic dye to lanthanide ion Yb3+. To overcome these limitations, we propose modifying coordination sites on dye conjugated structures and minimizing the distance between fluorescence cores and Yb3+ in upconversion nanoparticles (UCNPs). Our specially designed near&#8208;infrared (NIR) dye, disulfo&#8208;indocyanine green (disulfo&#8208;ICG), acts as the antenna molecule and exhibits a 2413&#8208;fold increase in luminescence under 808&#160;nm excitation compared to UCNPs alone using 980&#160;nm irradiation. The significant improvement is attributed to the high energy transfer efficiency of 72.1% from disulfo&#8208;ICG to Yb3+ in UCNPs, with majority of energy originating from triplet state (T1) of disulfo&#8208;ICG. Shortening the distance between the dye and lanthanide ions increases the probability of energy transfer and strengthens the heavy atom effect, leading to enhanced T1 generation and improved dye&#8208;triplet sensitization upconversion. Importantly, this approach also applies to 730&#160;nm excitation Cy7&#8208;SO3 sensitization system, overcoming the spectral mismatch between Cy7 and Yb3+ and achieving a 52&#8208;fold enhancement in luminescence. Furthermore, we demonstrate the enhancement of upconversion at single particle level through dye&#8208;sensitization. This strategy expands the range of NIR dyes for sensitization and opens new avenues for highly efficient dye&#8208;sensitized upconversion systems.

         <title>Advanced Multi&#8208;layered Electrode with Planar Building Blocks Structure for High Performance Lithium&#8208;ion Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
To achieve the high&#8208;performance of lithium&#8208;ion battery, the optimization of electrode materials has generally been considered as the one of the important methods. But most of those works pay attention to the new materials preparation or interface modification rather than the structural innovation. Here, an advanced electrode (GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E) with multi&#8208;level layered architecture constructed by planar building blocks stacking structure has been designed and fabricated to explore the structure design of electrode. This new structure is assembled by graphdiyne (GDY) and black phosphorus (BP) in parallel to form a building block (GDY/BP/GDY). The electric fields between the two GDY sides of the planar building block structure contribute to the superior migration dynamics of lithium ions and desirable pseudocapacitance behavior. Meanwhile, the planar stacking structure of GDY/BP/GDY can efficiently inhibit volume expansion of BP and a series of parasitic reactions of electrolytes during the long&#8208;term cycling. The advanced GDY/BP/GDY&#8208;E exhibits excellent high&#8208;rate performance (1418.8 mAh g&#8211;1 at 0.1 A g&#8211;1) and cycling stability (391.7 mAh g&#8211;1 after 5000 cycles at 10 A g&#8211;1). Such structure design of electrode materials shows us the new way to develop high performance electrode.

         <title>A Non&#8208;Expendable Leveler as Electrolyte Additive Enabling Homogenous Lithium Deposition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Li metal anodes have been extensively studied owing to their unparalleled advantages in achieving high energy density. However, safety issues originating from dendritic Li growth are always a huge hindrance for applications in Li metal batteries (LMBs). In this study, a functional additive, 4,6&#8208;dimethyl&#8208;2&#8208;mercaptopyrimidine (DMP), which is a typical leveler in the copper electroplating industry, was selected to suppress Li dendrite formation. Various Li&#8208;metal&#8208;based batteries were systematically investigated and they showed stable performances, such as excellent cycling stability above 800&#160;h at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in Li||Li cells and 400 cycles with high coulombic efficiencies (CEs &gt;98%) at 1&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 in Li||Cu cells. Furthermore, a comprehensive verification of the protective mechanism induced by the DMP leveling agent showed that the leveler updated the Li+ solvation structure and occupied the inner Helmholtz plane of the Li anode. The planar DMP molecular layer absorbed on the surface of the Li metal could suppress side reactions and modified the Li deposition behavior via steric hindrance, inducing homogeneous Li deposition. Interestingly, the DMP leveler did not participate in the formation of the solid electrolyte interphase. This study can stimulate further ideas on non&#8208;depleting but effective levelers as electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Ultrasonic Field Induces Better Crystallinity And Abundant Defects at Grain Boundaries to Develop Cus Electromagnetic Wave Absorber</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Ultrasonic field (USF) is widely used to regulate the intrinsic properties of materials that have not been applied in electromagnetic wave (EMW) absorption. One reason is that the lack of a response mechanism for the materials to USF hinders the expansion of their EMW absorption performance. Therefore, to address this issue, a series of CuS nanoparticles with diverse anions were&#160;constructed in the presence or absence of USF. The ultrasonic&#8208;induced cavitation effect can significantly promote CuS crystallization and lead to the accumulation of S defects at the grain boundaries (GBs). Furthermore, the S defects at the GBs were&#160;easily oriented and arranged, allowing the polarization relaxation retention to be maintained at 10&#160;wt.%. Consequently, the CuS with a nitrate precursor under USF showed an optimum effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 10.24&#160;GHz at a thickness of 3.5&#160;mm, which was&#160;228.6% more than that without the USF. CuS with a chloride precursor also achieved an EAB of 3.92&#160;GHz, even at a considerably low filler ratio. Thus, our&#160;study demonstrates the response mechanism of diverse anions to the USF for the first time and provides a novel technique to optimize the EMW absorption performance of semiconductors.

         <title>Generation of Terahertz Radiation via The Transverse Thermoelectric Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful tool with widespread applications ranging from imaging, sensing, and broadband communications to spectroscopy and nonlinear control of materials.[1] Future progress in THz technology depends on the development of efficient, structurally simple THz emitters that can be implemented in advanced miniaturized devices. Here we show how the natural electronic anisotropy of layered conducting transition metal oxides enables the generation of intense terahertz radiation via the transverse thermoelectric effect. In thin films grown on offcut substrates, femtosecond laser pulses generate ultrafast out&#8208;of&#8208;plane temperature gradients, which in turn launch in&#8208;plane thermoelectric currents, thus allowing efficient emission of the resulting THz field out of the film structure. We demonstrate this scheme in experiments on thin films of the layered metals PdCoO2 and La1.84Sr0.16CuO4, and present model calculations that elucidate the influence of the material parameters on the intensity and spectral characteristics of the emitted THz field. Due to its simplicity, the method opens up a promising avenue for the development of highly versatile THz sources and integrable emitter elements.

         <title>Anion Confinement for Homogenous Mixed Halide Perovskite Film Growth by Electrospray</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskites are promising absorbers for state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art tandem solar cells to feasibly surpass Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit with low cost. However, the commonly used mixed halide perovskites suffer from poor stability, particularly, photoinduced phase segregation. Electrospray deposition is developed to bridge the gap of growth rate between iodide and bromide components during film growth by spatially confining the anion diffusion and eliminating the kinetic difference, which universally improves the initial homogeneity of perovskite films regardless of device architectures. It thus promotes the efficiency and stability of corresponding solar cells based on wide&#8208;band gap (1.68&#160;eV) absorbers. Remarkable power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 21.44% and 20.77% are achieved in 0.08 cm2 and 1.0 cm2 devices, respectively. And these devices maintained 90% of their initial PCE after 1550&#160;h of stabilized power output (SPO) tracking upon 1 Sun irradiation (LED) at room temperature.

         <title>Selective Control of Phases and Electronic Structures of Monolayer TaTe2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Transition metal dichalcogenide films exhibit rich phases and superstructures, which can be controlled by the growth conditions as well as post&#8208;growth annealing treatment. Here, we&#160;report the selective growth of monolayer TaTe2 films with different phases as well as superstructures using molecular beam epitaxy. Monolayer 1H&#8208;TaTe2 and 1T&#8208;TaTe2 films can be selectively controlled by varying the growth temperature, and their different electronic structures are revealed through the combination of angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and first&#8208;principles calculations. Moreover, post&#8208;growth annealing of the 1H&#8208;TaTe2 film further leads to a transition from a 19&#215;19$\sqrt {19}{\times }\sqrt {19}$ superstructure to a new 2&#215;2 superstructure, where two gaps are observed in the electronic structure and persist up to room temperature. First&#8208;principles calculations reveal the role of the phonon instability in the superstructures and the effect of local atomic distortions on the modified electronic structures. Our&#160;work demonstrates the manipulation of the rich phases and superstructures of monolayer TaTe2 films by controlling the growth kinetics and post&#8208;growth&#160;annealing.

         <title>Continuous Volumetric 3D Printing: Xolography in Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Additive manufacturing techniques continue to improve in resolution, geometrical freedom, and production rates, expanding their application range in research and industry. Most established techniques, however, are based on layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer polymerization processes, leading to an inherent trade&#8208;off between resolution and printing speed. Volumetric 3D printing enables the polymerization of freely defined volumes allowing the fabrication of complex geometries at drastically increased production rates and high resolutions, marking the next chapter in light&#8208;based additive manufacturing. This work advances the volumetric 3D printing technique xolography to a continuous process. Dual&#8208;color photopolymerization is performed in a continuously flowing resin, inside a tailored flow cell. Supported by simulations, the flow profile in the printing area is flattened, and resin velocities at the flow cell walls are increased to minimize unwanted polymerization via laser sheet&#8208;induced curing. Various objects are printed continuously and true to shape with smooth surfaces. Parallel object printing paves the way for up&#8208;scaling the continuous production, currently reaching production rates up to 1.75&#160;mm3s&#8722;1$^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ for the presented flow cell. Xolography in flow provides a new opportunity for scaling up volumetric 3D printing with the potential to resolve the trade&#8208;off between high production rates and high resolution in light&#8208;based additive&#160;manufacturing.

         <title>Skin Thermal Management for Subcutaneous Photoelectric Conversion Reaching 500&#160;mW</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A subcutaneous power supply device utilizing second near&#8208;infrared light is proposed with the synergistic combination of photovoltaic cells and a thermoelectric generator. Skin thermal management is used to turn photothermal toxicity into a favorable factor for photoelectric conversion. In in vivo experiment, its output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%.








Abstract
Despite possessing higher tissue transmittance and maximum permissible exposure power density for skin relative to other electromagnetic waves, second near&#8208;infrared light (1000&#8211;1350&#160;nm) is scarcely applicable to subcutaneous photoelectric conversion, owing to the companion photothermal effect. Here, skin thermal management is conceived to utmostly utilize the photothermal effect of a photovoltaic cell, which not only improves the photoelectric conversion efficiency but also eliminates skin hyperthermia. In vivo, the output power can be higher than 500&#160;mW with a photoelectric conversion efficiency of 9.4%. This output power is promising to recharge all the clinically applied implantable devices via wireless power transmission, that is, clinical pacemakers (6&#8211;200&#160;&#181;W), drug pumps (0.5&#8211;2&#160;mW), cochlear (5&#8211;40&#160;mW), and wireless endo&#8208;photo cameras (&#8776;100&#160;mW).

         <title>Stability Issues in Electrochemical CO2 Reduction: Recent Advances in Fundamental Understanding and Design Strategies</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) offers a promising approach to close the anthropogenic carbon cycle and store intermittent renewable energy in fuels or chemicals. On the path to commercializing this technology, achieving the long&#8208;term operation stability is a central requirement but still confronts challenges. This motivates us to organize the present review to systematically discuss the stability issue of CO2RR. We start from the fundamental understanding on the destabilization mechanisms of CO2RR, with focus on the degradation of electrocatalyst and change of reaction microenvironment during continuous electrolysis. Subsequently, recent efforts on catalyst design to stabilize the active sites are summarized, where increasing atomic binding strength to resist surface reconstruction is highlighted. Next, we demonstrate the optimization of electrolysis system to enhance the operation stability by maintaining reaction microenvironment especially mitigating flooding and carbonate problems. The manipulation on operation conditions also enables to prolong CO2RR lifespan through recovering catalytically active sites and mass transport process. We finally end up by indicating the challenges and future opportunities.

Subsequently, recent efforts on catalyst design to stabilize the active sites are summarized, where increasing atomic binding strength to resist surface reconstruction is highlighted. Next, we demonstrate the optimization of electrolysis system to enhance the operation stability by maintaining reaction microenvironment especially mitigating flooding and carbonate problems. The manipulation on operation conditions also enables to prolong CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;RR lifespan through recovering catalytically active sites and mass transport process. We finally end up by indicating the challenges and future opportunities.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Liquid&#8208;Templating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Modern materials science has witnessed the era of advanced fabrication methods to engineer functionality from the nano&#8208; to macro&#8208;scales. Versatile fabrication and additive manufacturing methods have been developed, but the ability to design a material for a given application is still limited. Here, &#160;we introduce a novel strategy that enables target&#8208;oriented manufacturing of ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels with on&#8208;demand characteristics. The process relies on controllable liquid templating through interfacial complexation to generate tunable, stimuli&#8208;responsive 3D&#8208;structured (multi&#8208;phase) filamentous liquid templates. The methodology involves nanoscale chemistry and microscale assembly of nanoparticles (NPs) at liquid&#8208;liquid interfaces to produce hierarchical macroscopic aerogels featuring multi&#8208;scale porosity, ultra&#8208;low density (3.05&#8208;3.41&#160;mg cm&#8722;3), and high compressibility (90%) combined with elastic resilience and instant shape recovery. &#160;We overcome the challenges facing ultra&#8208;lightweight aerogels, including poor mechanical integrity and the inability to form predefined 3D constructs with on&#8208;demand functionality, for a multitude of applications. The controllable nature of the coined methodology enables obtaining tunable electromagnetic interference shielding with high specific shielding effectiveness (39,893&#160;dB cm2 g&#8722;1), and one of the highest&#8208;ever reported oil absorption rates (48,728% for chloroform). These properties originate from the engineerable nature of liquid templating, pushing the boundaries of lightweight materials to systematic function design and applications.

         <title>Ultrahigh Permeability at High Frequencies via A Magnetic&#8208;Heterogeneous Nanocrystallization Mechanism in An Iron&#8208;Based Amorphous Alloy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
The prevalence of wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) semiconductors allows modern electronic devices to operate at much higher frequencies. However, development of soft magnetic materials with high&#8208;frequency properties matching the WBG&#8208;based devices remains challenging. Here &#160;we report a promising nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous composite alloy with a normal composition Fe75.5Co0.5Mo0.5Cu1Nb1.5Si13B8 in atomic percent, producible under industrial conditions, which shows an exceptionally high permeability at high frequencies up to 36000 at 100&#160;kHz, an increase of 44% compared with commercial FeSiBCuNb nanocrystalline alloy (25000&#177;2000 at 100&#160;kHz), outperforming all existing nanocrystalline alloy systems and commercial soft magnetic materials. The alloy is obtained by a unique magnetic&#8208;heterogeneous nanocrystallization mechanism in an iron&#8208;based amorphous alloy, which is different from traditional strategy of nanocrystallization by doping non&#8208;magnetic elements (e.g., Cu and Nb). The induced magnetic inhomogeneity by adding Co atoms promotes locally the formation of highly ordered structures acting as the nuclei of nanocrystals, and Mo atoms agglomerate around the interfaces of nanocrystals, inhibiting nanocrystal growth, resulting in an ultrafine nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase structure in the alloy. The exceptional soft magnetic properties are shown to be closely related to the low magnetic anisotropy and the unique spin rotation mechanism under alternating magnetic fields.

         <title>Advancements in Achieving High Reversibility of Zinc Anode for Alkaline Zinc&#8208;based Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rechargeable alkaline zinc&#8208;based batteries (ZBBs) have attracted extensive research attention due to their advantages of low cost, high specific energy, and high safety. Although the investigation of cathodes for alkaline secondary ZBBs has reached a relatively advanced stage, the exploration of zinc anodes is still in its infancy. Zinc anodes in alkaline electrolytes encounter challenges such as dendrite formation, passivation, corrosion during periods of cell inactivity and hydrogen evolution during cycling, thereby limiting their rechargeability and storability. Drawing upon the latest research on zinc anodes,&#160;we&#160;have identified and categorized six fundamental strategies that encompass a wide range of aspects, from electrode modifications and electrolytes to charge protocols. Specifically, these strategies include 3D structures, coatings, alloying, additives, separators, and charge protocols. They serve as an insight summary of the current research progress on zinc anodes. Additionally, the complementary nature of these strategies allows for flexible combination, enabling further enhancement of the overall performance of zinc anodes. Finally, several future directions for the advancement of practical alkaline Zn anode are proposed. This comprehensive review not only consolidates the existing knowledge but also paves the way for broader research opportunities in the pursuit of high&#8208;performance alkaline zinc anodes.

         <title>Nanoparticle&#8208;based Photothermal Therapy for Breast Cancer Non&#8208;Invasive Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Rapid advancements in materials science and nanotechnology, intertwined with oncology, have positioned photothermal therapy (PTT) as a promising noninvasive treatment strategy for cancer. The breast's superficial anatomical location and aesthetic significance render breast cancer a particularly pertinent candidate for the clinical application of PTT following melanoma. This review comprehensively explores the research conducted on the various types of nanoparticles employed in PTT for breast cancer and elaborates on their specific roles and mechanisms of action. The integration of PTT with existing clinical therapies for breast cancer has been scrutinized, underscoring its potential for synergistic outcomes. Additionally, the mechanisms underlying PTT and consequential modifications to the tumor microenvironment after treatment are elaborated from a medical perspective. Future research directions are suggested, with an emphasis on the development of integrative platforms that combine multiple therapeutic approaches and the optimization of nanoparticle synthesis for enhanced treatment efficacy. The goal was to push the boundaries of PTT towards a comprehensive, clinically applicable treatment for breast cancer.
Abstract Schema: PTT is integrated into four key aspects of breast cancer treatment: (A) Categorization of nanoparticles functioning as thermal cores used in photothermal agents for breast cancer treatment. (B) Depiction of ligands or targeted components employed for surface modification of nanoparticles. (C) The tripartite benefits of photothermal therapy in the management of breast cancer. (D) An overview of various clinical treatment strategies for breast cancer, with surgery at the core, accompanied by diverse adjuvant therapies

         <title>Multifunctional High Entropy Alloy Enabled by Severe Lattice Distortion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Since 2004, the design of high entropy alloys (HEAs) has generated significant interest within the materials science community due to their exceptional structural and functional properties. By incorporating multiple principal elements into a common lattice, it is possible to create a single&#8208;phase crystal with a highly distorted lattice. This unique feature enables HEAs to offer a promising combination of mechanical and physical properties that are not typically observed in conventional alloys. In this article, we&#160;provide an extensive overview of multifunctional HEAs that exhibit severe lattice distortion, covering the theoretical models that were&#160;developed to understand lattice distortion, the experimental and computational methods employed to characterize lattice distortion, and most importantly, the impact of severe lattice distortion on the mechanical, physical and electrochemical properties of HEAs. Through this review, we&#160;hope to stimulate further research into the study of distorted lattices in crystalline solids.

         <title>Conjugated Nickel Phthalocyanine Derivatives for Heterogeneous Electrocatalytic H2O2 Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrocatalytic H2O2 production has emerged as a promising alternative to the chemical method currently used in industry, due to its environmentally friendly conditions and potential for higher activity and selectivity. Heterogeneous molecular catalysts are promising in this regard, as their active site configurations could be judiciously designed, modified and tailored with diverse functional groups, thereby tuning the activity and selectivity of the active sites. In this work, nickel phthalocyanine derivatives with various conjugation degrees were synthesized and identified as effective pH&#8208;universal electrocatalysts for H2O2 production after heterogenized on nitrogen&#8208;decorated carbon, with increased conjugation degrees leading to boosted selectivity. This is explained by the regulated d&#8208;band center, which optimized the binding energy of the reaction intermediate, reducing the energy barrier for oxygen reduction and leading to optimized H2O2 selectivity. The best catalyst, NiPyCN/CN, exhibits a high H2O2&#160;electrosynthesis activity with nearly 95% of H2O2&#160;faradic efficiency in an alkaline medium, demonstrating its potential for H2O2 production.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Electrocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production has emerged as a promising alternative to the chemical method currently used in industry, due to its environmentally friendly conditions and potential for higher activity and selectivity. Heterogeneous molecular catalysts are promising in this regard, as their active site configurations could be judiciously designed, modified and tailored with diverse functional groups, thereby tuning the activity and selectivity of the active sites. In this work, nickel phthalocyanine derivatives with various conjugation degrees were synthesized and identified as effective pH-universal electrocatalysts for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production after heterogenized on nitrogen-decorated carbon, with increased conjugation degrees leading to boosted selectivity. This is explained by the regulated d-band center, which optimized the binding energy of the reaction intermediate, reducing the energy barrier for oxygen reduction and leading to optimized H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; selectivity. The best catalyst, NiPyCN/CN, exhibits a high H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;electrosynthesis activity with nearly 95% of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&#160;faradic efficiency in an alkaline medium, demonstrating its potential for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;

         <title>Wood&#8208;Derived Freestanding Carbon&#8208;based Electrode with Hierarchical Structure for Industrial&#8208;Level Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
The sustainable and scalable fabrication of low&#8208;cost, efficient and durable electrocatalysts that operate well at industrial&#8208;level current density is urgently needed for large&#8208;scale implementation of the water splitting to produce hydrogen. In this work, an integrated carbon electrode is constructed by encapsulating Ni nanoparticles within N&#8208;doped carbonized wood framework (Ni@NCW). Such integrated electrode with hierarchically porous structure facilitates mass transfer process for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Ni@NCW electrode can be employed directly as a robust electrocatalyst for HER, which affords the industrial&#8208;level current density of 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 at low overpotential of 401&#160;mV. The freestanding binder&#8208;free electrode exhibits extraordinary stability for 100&#160;h. An anion exchange membrane water electrolysis (AEMWE) electrolyzer assembled with such freestanding carbon electrode requires only a lower cell voltage of 2.43&#160;V to achieve ampere&#8208;level current of 4.0 A for hydrogen production without significant performance degradation. These advantages reveal the great potential of this strategy in designing cost&#8208;effective freestanding electrode with monometallic, bimetallic or trimetallic species based on abundant natural wood resources for water splitting.

         <title>Electron Oscillation&#8208;Induced Splitting Electroluminescence from Nano&#8208;Leds for Device&#8208;Level Encryption</title>

Abstract
Data security is a major concern in digital age, which generally relies on algorithm&#8208;based mathematical encryption. Recently, encryption techniques based on physical principles are emerging and being developed, leading to the new generation of encryption moving from mathematics to the intersection of mathematics and physics. Here, device&#8208;level encryption with ideal security is ingeniously achieved using modulation of the electron&#8208;hole radiative recombination in a GaN&#8208;LED. When a nano&#8208;LED is driven in the non&#8208;carrier injection mode, the oscillation of confined electrons can split what should be a single light pulse into multiple pulses. The morphology (amplitude, shape and pulse number) of those history&#8208;dependent multiple pulses that act as carriers for transmitted digital information depends highly on the parameters of the driving signals, which makes those signals mathematically uncrackable and can increase the volume and security of transmitted information. Moreover, a hardware and software platform are designed to demonstrate the encrypted data transmission based on the device&#8208;level encryption method, enabling recognition of the entire ASCII code table. The device&#8208;level encryption based on splitting electroluminescence provides an encryption method during the conversion process of digital signals to optical signals and can improve the security of LED&#8208;based communication.

         <title>Exogenous Antigen Upregulation Empowers Antibody Targeted Nanochemotherapy of Leukemia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acute myeloid leukemia remains largely incurable due to the lack of suitable surface antigens and targeted therapeutics. This study presents a facile combination strategy of exogenous antigen upregulation with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal nanotherapeutics (DPV) that allows super&#8208;targeting and high&#8208;efficacy elimination of leukemia cells, leading to striking survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% complete cure.








Abstract
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is afflicted by a high&#8208;mortality rate and few treatment options. The lack of specific surface antigens severely hampers the development of targeted therapeutics and cell therapy. Here, it is shown that exogenous all&#8208;trans retinoic acid (ATRA) mediates selective and transient CD38 upregulation on leukemia cells by up to 20&#8208;fold, which enables high&#8208;efficiency targeted nanochemotherapy of leukemia with daratumumab antibody&#8208;directed polymersomal vincristine sulfate (DPV). Strikingly, treatment of two CD38&#8208;low expressing AML orthotopic models with ATRA and DPV portfolio strategies effectively eliminates circulating leukemia cells and leukemia invasion into bone marrow and organs, leading to exceptional survival benefits with 20&#8211;40% of mice becoming leukemia&#8208;free. The combination of exogenous CD38 upregulation and antibody&#8208;directed nanotherapeutics provides a unique and powerful targeted therapy for leukemia.

         <title>Multifunctional Additive CdAc2 for Efficient Perovskite&#8208;Based Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple and effective method by using the multifunctional additive cadmium acetate (CdAc2) to obtain high&#8208;quality perovskite films for efficient flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs) and perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs). The resulting FPSCs and TSCs achieve a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% and 29.25% (under AM 1.5G illumination), respectively.








Abstract
Polycrystalline perovskite films fabricated on flexible and textured substrates often are highly defective, leading to poor performance of perovskite devices. Finding substrate&#8208;tolerant perovskite fabrication strategies is therefore paramount. Herein, this study shows that adding a small amount of Cadmium Acetate (CdAc2) in the PbI2 precursor solution results in nano&#8208;hole array films and improves the diffusion of organic salts in PbI2 and promotes favorable crystal orientation and suppresses non&#8208;radiative recombination. Polycrystalline perovskite films on the flexible substrate with ultra&#8208;long carrier lifetimes exceeding 6&#160;&#181;s are achieved. Eventually, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.78% is obtained for single&#8208;junction flexible perovskite solar cells (FPSCs). Furthermore, it is found that the strategy is also applicable for textured tandem solar cells. A champion PCE of 29.25% (0.5003&#160;cm2) is demonstrated for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) with CdAc2. Moreover, the un&#8208;encapsulated TSCs maintains 109.78% of its initial efficiency after 300&#160;h operational at 45&#160;&#176;C in a&#160; nitrogen atmosphere. This study provides a facile strategy for achieving high&#8208;efficiency perovskite&#8208;based solar cells.

         <title>Reactive Deposition Versus Strong Electrostatic Adsorption (SEA): A Key to Highly Active Single Atom Co&#8208;Catalysts in Photocatalytic H2 Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A reactive attachment based on hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid is shown to lead directly to single atom configuration with a significantly higher specific H2 evolution activity than achieved with strong electrostatic adsorption &#8211; and this is at a significantly lower Pt loading without any post&#8208;deposition treatment.








Abstract
In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H2 generation; here SA&#160;noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co&#8208;catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes.

&lt;p&gt;A reactive attachment based on hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid is shown to lead directly to single atom configuration with a significantly higher specific H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; evolution activity than achieved with strong electrostatic adsorption &#8211; and this is at a significantly lower Pt loading without any post-deposition treatment.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In recent years, the use of single atoms (SAs) has become of a rapidly increasing significance in photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; generation; here SA&#160;noble metals (mainly Pt SAs) can act as highly effective co-catalysts. The classic strategy to decorate oxide semiconductor surfaces with maximally dispersed SAs relies on &#8220;strong electrostatic adsorption&#8221; (SEA) of suitable noble metal complexes. In the case of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &#8211; the classic benchmark photocatalyst &#8211; SEA calls for adsorption of cationic Pt complexes such as [(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Pt]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; which then are thermally reacted to surface-bound SAs. While SEA is widely used in literature, in the present work it is shown by a direct comparison that reactive attachment based on the reductive anchoring of SAs, e.g., from hexachloroplatinic(IV) acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PtCl&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&#160;leads directly to SAs in a configuration with a significantly higher specific activity than SAs deposited with SEA &#8211; and this at a significantly lower Pt loading and without any thermal post-deposition treatments. Overall, the work demonstrates that the reactive deposition strategy is superior to the classic SEA concept as it provides a direct electronically well-connected SA-anchoring and thus leads to highly active single-atom sites in photocatalysis.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward High&#8208;Performance Metal&#8211;Organic&#8208;Framework&#8208;Based Quasi&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Electrolytes: Tunable Structures and Electrochemical Properties</title>

A series of nanocrystalline MOFs with similar morphology but various topologic structures is synthesized as platform to systematically study the structure&#8211;property relationship of MOF&#8208;based quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for lithium batteries.








Abstract
Metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) have been reported as promising materials for electrochemical applications owing to their tunable porous structures and ion&#8208;sieving capability. However, it remains challenging to rationally design MOF&#8208;based electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries. In this work, by combining advanced characterization and modeling tools, a series of nanocrystalline MOFs is designed, and the effects of pore apertures and open metal sites on ion&#8208;transport properties and electrochemical stability of MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes are systematically studied. It isdemonstrated that MOFs with non&#8208;redox&#8208;active metal centers can&#160;lead to a much wider electrochemical stability window than those with redox&#8208;active centers. Furthermore, the pore aperture of MOFs is found to be a dominating factor that determines the uptake of lithium salt and thus ionic conductivity. The ab initio molecular dynamics simulations further demonstrate that open metal sites of MOFs can facilitate the dissociation of lithium salt and immobilize anions via Lewis acid&#8211;base interaction, leading to good lithium&#8208;ion mobility and high transference number. The MOF quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolyte demonstrates great battery performance with commercial LiFePO4 and LiCoO2 cathodes at 30&#160;&#176;C. This work provides new insights into structure&#8211;property relationships between tunable structure and electrochemical properties of MOFs that can lead to the development of advanced quasi&#8208;solid&#8208;state electrolytes for high&#8208;energy lithium batteries.

         <title>Mimosa&#8208;Inspired Stimuli&#8208;Responsive Curling Bioadhesive Tape Promotes Peripheral Nerve Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by Mimosa pudica, a stimulated curling bioadhesive tape (SCT) hydrogel is developed that responds rapidly to curl and transient adhesion on moist tissues, adapts to the curvature of different nerve diameters to achieve conformal contact, and is also biocompatible. SCT hydrogel thus reduces the risk of surgical suturing for nerve injury repair.








Abstract
Trauma often results in peripheral nerve injuries (PNIs). These injuries are particularly challenging therapeutically because of variable nerve diameters, slow axonal regeneration, infection of severed ends, fragility of the nerve tissue, and the intricacy of surgical intervention. Surgical suturing is likely to cause additional damage to peripheral nerves. Therefore, an ideal nerve scaffold should possess good biocompatibility, diameter adaptability, and a stable biological interface for seamless biointegration with tissues. Inspired by the curl of Mimosa pudica, this study aimed to design and develop a diameter&#8208;adaptable, suture&#8208;free, stimulated curling bioadhesive tape (SCT) hydrogel for repairing PNI. The hydrogel is fabricated from chitosan and acrylic acid&#8208;N&#8208;hydroxysuccinimide lipid via gradient crosslinking using glutaraldehyde. It closely matches the nerves of different individuals and regions, thereby providing a bionic scaffold for axonal regeneration. In addition, this hydrogel rapidly absorbs tissue fluid from the nerve surface achieving durable wet&#8208;interface adhesion. Furthermore, the chitosan&#8208;based SCT hydrogel loaded with insulin&#8208;like growth factor&#8208;I effectively promotes peripheral nerve regeneration with excellent bioactivity. This procedure for peripheral nerve injury repair using the SCT hydrogel is simple and reduces the difficulty and duration of surgery, thereby advancing adaptive biointerfaces and reliable materials for nerve repair.

         <title>Artificial Spider Silk with Buckled Sheath by Nano&#8208;Pulley Combing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The artificial spider silk with buckled sheath&#8211;core structure is developed by nano&#8208;pulley combing of polyrotaxane through cyclic stretch&#8211;release training. Its breaking strength and toughness reach 1.61&#160;GPa and 466&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively, exceeding those of Caerostris darwini silk. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and intelligent fiber materials.








Abstract
The axial orientation of molecular chains always results in an increase in fiber strength and a decrease in toughness. Here, taking inspiration from the skin structure, artificial spider silk with a buckled sheath&#8211;core structure is developed, with mechanical strength and toughness reaching 1.61&#160;GPa and 466&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, respectively, exceeding those of Caerostris darwini silk. The buckled structure is achieved by nano&#8208;pulley combing of polyrotaxane hydrogel fibers through cyclic stretch&#8211;release training, which exhibits axial alignment of the polymer chains in the fiber core and buckling in the fiber sheath. The artificial spider silk also exhibits excellent supercontraction behavior, achieving a work capacity of 1.89&#160;kJ&#160;kg&#8722;1, and an actuation stroke of 82%. This work provides a new strategy for designing high&#8208;performance and intelligent fiber materials.

         <title>Controlled Electronic and Magnetic Landscape in Self&#8208;Assembled Complex Oxide Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates a new conceptual method for self&#8208;assembly bottom&#8208;up thin film growth evoking a transient growth &#8211; a 2D layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer growth, followed by a vertically aligned two&#8208;phase nanocomposite oxide growth, based on a miscible LaAlO3:LaBO3 composite, grown on SrTiO3(001). This transition exhbits unique strain orderings, coupled with the the generation of electronic and magnetic properties&#160;at the horizontal and vertical interfaces.








Abstract
Complex oxide heterointerfaces contain a rich playground of novel physical properties and functionalities, which give rise to emerging technologies. Among designing and controlling the functional properties of complex oxide film heterostructures, vertically aligned nanostructure (VAN) films using a self&#8208;assembling bottom&#8208;up deposition method presents great promise in terms of structural flexibility and property tunability. Here, the bottom&#8208;up self&#8208;assembly is extended to a new approach using a mixture containing a 2Dlayer&#8208;by&#8208;layer film growth, followed by a 3D VAN film growth. In this work, the two&#8208;phase nanocomposite thin films are based on LaAlO3:LaBO3, grown on a lattice&#8208;mismatched SrTiO3001 (001) single crystal.&#160;The 2D&#8208;to&#8208;3D transient structural assembly is primarily controlled by the composition ratio, leading to the coexistence of multiple interfacial properties, 2D electron gas, and magnetic anisotropy. This approach provides multidimensional film heterostructures which enrich the emergent phenomena for multifunctional applications.

In this work, the two-phase nanocomposite thin films are based on LaAlO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;:LaBO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, grown on a lattice-mismatched SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3001&lt;/sub&gt; (001) single crystal.&#160;The 2D-to-3D transient structural assembly is primarily controlled by the composition ratio, leading to the coexistence of multiple interfacial properties, 2D electron gas, and magnetic anisotropy. This approach provides multidimensional film heterostructures which enrich the emergent phenomena for multifunctional applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ultrafast Electrical Pulse Synthesis of Highly Active Electrocatalysts for Beyond&#8208;Industrial&#8208;Level Hydrogen Gas Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrocatalysts with low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;activity, such as RuNi/C, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level Ni&#63743;H2 batteries. The low&#8208;cost, high&#8208;safety, long&#8208;life, and all&#8208;climate Ni&#63743;H2 batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.








Abstract
The high reliability and proven ultra&#8208;longevity make aqueous hydrogen gas (H2) batteries ideal for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, the low alkaline hydrogen evolution and oxidation reaction (HER/HOR) activities of expensive platinum catalysts severely hamper their widespread applications in H2 batteries. Here, cost&#8208;effective, highly active electrocatalysts, with a model of ruthenium&#8208;nickel alloy nanoparticles in &#8776;3&#160;nm anchored on carbon black (RuNi/C) as an example, are developed by an ultrafast electrical pulse approach for nickel&#8208;hydrogen gas (Ni&#63743;H2) batteries. Having a competitive low cost of about one fifth of Pt/C benckmark, this ultrafine RuNi/C catalyst displays an ultrahigh HOR mass activity of 2.34 A mg&#8722;1 at 50 mV (vs RHE) and an ultralow HER overpotential of 19.5 mV at a current density of 10 mA cm&#8722;2. As a result, the advanced Ni&#63743;H2 battery can efficiently operate under all&#8208;climate conditions (from &#8722;25 to +50 &#176;C) with excellent durability. Notably, the Ni&#63743;H2 cell stack achieves an energy density up to 183&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 and an estimated cost of &#8776;49 $ kWh&#8722;1 under an ultrahigh cathode Ni(OH)2 loading of 280&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and a low anode Ru loading of &#8776;62.5&#160;&#181;g cm&#8722;2. The advanced beyond&#8208;industrial&#8208;level hydrogen gas batteries provide great opportunities for practical grid&#8208;scale energy storage applications.

         <title>Interlayer&#8208;Confined NiFe Dual Atoms within MoS2 Electrocatalyst for Ultra&#8208;Efficient Acidic Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ingenious approach is proposed to assemble Ni and Fe dual atoms into the interlayer of MoS2. Combined with the diatomic species, this interlayer&#8211;confined structure with confinement effect, displays the high catalytic activity towards water splitting and high stablity even in harsh acidic reaction condition. This work provides a new direction for single&#8211;atom catalysts development in the future.








Abstract
Confining dual atoms (DAs) within the van der Waals gap of 2D layered materials is expected to expedite the kinetic and energetic strength in catalytic process, yet is a huge challenge in atomic&#8208;scale precise assembling DAs within two adjacent layers in the 2D limit. Here, an ingenious approach is proposed to assemble DAs of Ni and Fe into the interlayer of MoS2. While inheriting the exceptional merits of diatomic species, this interlayer&#8208;confined structure arms itself with confinement effect, displaying the more favorable adsorption strength on the confined metal active center and higher catalytic activity towards acidic water splitting, as verified by intensive research efforts of theoretical calculations and experimental measurements. Moreover, the interlayer&#8208;confined structure also renders metal DAs a protective shelter to survive in harsh acidic environment. The findings embodied the confinement effects at the atom level, and interlayer&#8208;confined assembling of multiple species highlights a general pathway to advance interlayer&#8208;confined DAs catalysts within various 2D materials.

         <title>Strong Tough Thermogalvanic Hydrogel Thermocell With Extraordinarily High Thermoelectric Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) is prepared by combining stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and thermoelectric effects. The SPTC provides the best comprehensive mechanical and thermoelectric properties among reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic hydrogel thermocells. The SPTC&#8208;based systems are demonstrated in energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring. This proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept device can provide a reference for the design of flexible and robust wearable electronics.








Abstract
Thermocells can continuously convert heat into electricity, and they are widely used to power wearable electronic devices. However, they have a risk of leakage and poor mechanical properties. Although quasi&#8208;solid ionic thermocells can overcome the issue of electrolyte leakage, the trade&#8208;off between their excellent mechanical properties and high thermopower remains a major challenge. In this study, stretching&#8208;induced crystallization and the thermoelectric effect are combined to propose a high&#8208;strength quasi&#8208;solid stretchable polyvinyl alcohol thermogalvanic thermocell (SPTC) with a large tensile strength of 19&#160;MPa and high thermopower of 6.5&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1. The SPTC exhibits a high stretchability of 1300%, ultrahigh toughness of 163.4&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, and high specific output power density of 1969&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;2&#160;K&#8722;2. These comprehensive properties are superior to those of previously reported quasi&#8208;solid stretchable thermogalvanic thermocells. The use of SPTC&#8208;based systems in wearable devices for energy&#8208;autonomous strain sensors and health monitoring is demonstrated. This can facilitate the rapid implementation of sustainable wearable electronics in the Internet of Things era.

         <title>Neuron&#8208;Inspired Sticky Artificial Spider Silk for Signal Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Neuron&#8208;inspired sticky artificial spider silk is prepared based on proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fibers, which exhibits excellent mechanical robustness and ionic conductivity. It provides a new design strategy for signal transmission and regulation applications in bioelectrodes and artificial synapse.








Abstract
Neurons exhibit excellent signal transmission capacity, which inspire artificial neuron materials for applications in the field of wearable electronics and soft robotics. In addition, the neuron fibers exhibit good mechanical robustness by sticking to the organs, which currently has rarely been studied. Here, a sticky artificial spider silk is developed by employing a proton donor&#8208;acceptor (PrDA) hydrogel fiber for application as artificial neuron fibers. Tuning the molecular electrostatic interactions by modulating the sequences of proton donors and acceptors, enables combination of excellent mechanical properties, stickiness, and ion conductivity. In addition, the PrDA hydrogel exhibits high spinning capacity for a wide range of donor&#8208;acceptor combinations. The PrDA artificial spider silk would shed light on the design of new generation of artificial neuron materials, bio&#8208;electrodes, and artificial synapses.

         <title>Hierarchically Porous Carbons with Highly Curved Surfaces for Hosting Single Metal FeN4 Sites as Outstanding Oxygen Reduction Catalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The oxygen reduction reaction activity and stability of a single&#8208;atom Fe&#63743;N&#63743;C electrocatalyst&#160;are promoted by engineering FeN4 active sites on hierarchical carbons comprising highly curved surfaces (FeN4&#8208;hcC). The achieved FeN4&#8208;hcC displays&#160;outstanding oxygen reduction reaction performance in acidic media and promising activity in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells.








Abstract
Iron&#8211;nitrogen&#8211;carbon (Fe&#63743;N&#63743;C) materials have emerged as a promising alternative to platinum&#8208;group metals for catalyzing the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells. However, their low intrinsic activity and stability are major impediments. Herein, an Fe&#63743;N&#8211;C electrocatalyst with dense FeN4 sites on hierarchically porous carbons with highly curved surfaces (denoted as FeN4&#8208;hcC) is reported. The FeN4&#8208;hcC catalyst displays exceptional ORR activity in acidic media, with a high half&#8208;wave potential of 0.85&#160;V (versus reversible hydrogen electrode) in 0.5&#160;m H2SO4. When integrated into a membrane electrode assembly, the corresponding cathode displays a high maximum peak power density of 0.592&#160;W cm&#8722;2 and demonstrates operating durability over 30&#160;000 cycles under harsh H2/air conditions, outperforming previously reported Fe&#8211;N&#63743;C electrocatalysts. These experimental and theoretical studies suggest that the curved carbon support fine&#8208;tunes the local coordination environment, lowers the energies of the Fe d&#8208;band centers, and inhibits the adsorption of oxygenated species, which can enhance the ORR activity and stability. This work provides new insight into the carbon nanostructure&#8211;activity correlation for ORR catalysis. It also offers a new approach to designing advanced single&#8208;metal&#8208;site catalysts for energy&#8208;conversion applications.

         <title>Multifunctionality through Embedding Patterned Nanostructures in High&#8208;Performance Composites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable spray coating is introduced for controlled deposition of nanomaterials with tailorable patterns. Guided by the droplet's internal currents, amphiphilicity of the nanomaterials grants control over the specific surface area and bonding energy values. Controlling the ring&#8208;disk pattern transition regulates theinterfaces, crack containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity, which is lacking in conventional manufacturing with the random inclusion of nanoparticles.








Abstract
Despite being a pillar of high&#8208;performance materials in industry, manufacturing carbon fiber composites with simultaneously enhanced multifunctionality and structural properties has remained elusive due to the lack of practical bottom&#8208;up approaches with control over nanoscale interactions. Guided by the droplet's internal currents and amphiphilicity of&#160;nanomaterials, herein, a programmable spray coating is introduced for the deposition of multiple nanomaterials with tailorable patterns in composite.&#160;&#160;It is shown that such patterns regulate&#160;the formation of interfaces, damage containment, and electrical&#8208;thermal conductivity of the composites, which is absent in conventional manufacturing that primarily rely on incorporating nanomaterials to achieve specific functionalities. Molecular dynamics simulations show that increasing the hydrophilicity of the hybrid nanomaterials, which is synchronous with shifting patterns from disk to ring, improves the interactions between the carbon surfaces and epoxy at the interfaces,manifested in enhanced&#160;interlaminar and flexural performance. Transitioning from ring to disk creates a larger interconnected network &#160;leading to improved thermal and electrical properties without penalty in&#160;mechanical properties. This novel approach introduces a new design , where the mechanical and multifunctional performance is controlled by the shape of the deposited patterns, thus&#160;eliminating the trade&#8208;off between properties that are considered paradoxical in today's manufacturing of hierarchical composites.

         <title>Versatile Mesoporous Microblocks Prepared by Pattern&#8208;Induced Cracking of Colloidal Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Versatile mesoporous microblocks are fabricated through the controlling crack template, which is an economic and environmentally friendly process. Various sizes of rectangular microblocks demonstrate anticounterfeit functions by encoding the rotation angles with different colors. In addition, size&#8208;tunable functionalized microblocks selectively separate chemicals and collect or eliminate them for environmental applications.








Abstract
Mesoporous microparticles have the potential to be used in various fields, such as energy generation, sensing, and the environmental field. Recently, the process of making homogeneous microparticles in an economical and environmentally friendly way has gained much attention. Herein, rectangular mesoporous microblocks of various designs are produced by manipulating the fragmentation of colloidal films consisting of micropyramids while controlling the notch angles of pyramidal edges. During calcination of the colloidal films, cracks are generated in the valleys of micropyramids acting as notches, and the angle of notches can be controlled by the prepattern underneath the micropyramids. By changing the location of notches with sharp angles, the shape of microblocks can be controlled with excellent uniformity. After detaching the microblocks from substrates, mesoporous microparticles of various sizes with multiple functions are easily produced. This study demonstrates anti&#8208;counterfeiting functions by encoding the rotation angles of rectangular microblocks of various sizes. In addition, the mesoporous microparticles can be utilized for separating desired chemicals mixed with chemicals of different charges. The method of fabricating size&#8208;tunable functionalized mesoporous microblocks can be a platform technology to prepare special films and catalysts and for environmental applications.

         <title>Circadian Clock Regulation via Biomaterials for Nucleus Pulposus</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus and improve disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8211;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid.








Abstract
Circadian clock disorder during tissue degeneration has been considered the potential pathogenesis for various chronic diseases, such as intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD). In this study, circadian clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials (ClockMPs) that can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells (NPCs) in IVDD and improve the physiological function of NPCs for disc regeneration are fabricated via air&#8208;microfluidic technique and the chemical cross&#8208;linking between polyvinyl alcohol and modified&#8208;phenylboronic acid. In vitro experiments verified that ClockMPs can scavenge reactive oxygen species to maintain a stable microenvironment for the circadian clock by promoting the binding of BMAL1 and CLOCK proteins. ClockMPs can regulate the expression of core circadian clock genes by activating the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway in NPCs to remodel the intrinsic circadian clock and promote extracellular matrix synthesis. Furthermore, in vivo experiments of IVDD treated with ClockMPs proved that ClockMPs can promote disc regeneration by regulating the circadian clock of NPCs. In conclusion, ClockMPs provided a novel and promising strategy for circadian clock regulation during tissue regeneration.

Semi&#8208;floating&#8208;gate&#8208;controlled 2D lateral homojunctions based on InSe (MoS2)/hBN/graphite van der Waals heterostructures with an atomically sharp interface on a Si substrate, can be ultrafast&#8208;programmed in &#8776;20&#160;ns. The high rectification ratio of &#8776;105 and four dynamically switchable non&#8208;volatile memory states make them work as rectifiers, non&#8208;volatile memories, and reconfigurable multi&#8208;valued logic inverters.








Abstract
The development of electrically ultrafast&#8208;programmable semiconductor homojunctions can lead to transformative multifunctional electronic devices. However, silicon&#8208;based homojunctions are not programmable so that alternative materials need to be explored. Here 2D, multi&#8208;functional, lateral homojunctions made of van der Waals heterostructures with a semi&#8208;floating&#8208;gate configuration on a p++ Si substrate feature atomically sharp interfaces and can be electrostatically programmed in nanoseconds, more than seven orders of magnitude faster than other 2D&#8208;based homojunctions. By applying voltage pulses with different polarities, lateral p&#8722;n, n+&#8722;n and other types of homojunctions can be formed, varied, and reversed. The p&#8722;n homojunctions possess a high rectification ratio of up to &#8776;105 and can be dynamically switched between four distinct conduction states with the current spanning over nine orders of magnitude, enabling them to function as logic rectifiers, memories, and multi&#8208;valued logic inverters. Built on a p++ Si substrate, which acts as the control gate, the devices are compatible with Si technology.

         <title>Imitating Architectural Mortise&#8208;Tenon Structure for Stable Ni&#8208;Rich Layered Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A layered LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 material with implanted architectural mortise&#8208;tenon (MT) structures is developed. These MT structures not only improve the mechanochemical stability by suppressing the intrinsic anisotropic volume change but also provide an expressway for fast Li&#8208;ion transport. This layered LiNi0.8C0.1Mn0.1O2 exhibits a capacity retention of 82% over 1200 cycles (1C) and a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%.








Abstract
Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides are the most promising cathodes for Li&#8208;ion batteries, but chemo&#8208;mechanical failures during cycling and large first&#8208;cycle capacity loss hinder their applications in high&#8208;energy batteries. Herein, by introducing spinel&#8208;like mortise&#8208;tenon structures into the layered phase of LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 (NCM811), the adverse volume variations in cathode materials can be significantly suppressed. Meanwhile, these mortise&#8208;tenon structures play the role of the expressway for fast lithium&#8208;ion transport, which is substantiated by experiments and calculations. Moreover, the particles with mortise&#8208;tenon structures usually terminate with the most stable (003) facet. The new cathode exhibits a discharge capacity of 215&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at 0.1&#160;C with an initial Coulombic efficiency of 97.5%, and capacity retention of 82.2% after 1200 cycles at 1&#160;C. This work offers a viable lattice engineering to address the stability and low initial Coulombic efficiency of the Ni&#8208;rich layered oxides, and facilitates the implementation of Li&#8208;ion batteries with high&#8208;energy density and long durability.

         <title>Efficient Narrow&#8208;Bandgap Mixed Tin&#8208;Lead Perovskite Solar Cells via Natural Tin Oxide Doping</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit improved film morphology, crystallization, optical properties, and more interestingly, an upshifted Fermi level. Consequently, SnOx&#8208;doped devices have considerably reduced defects and improved transport of major carriers, resulting in a maximum efficiency of 22.16% for Sn&#8208;Pb single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable efficiency of 26.01% for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells.








Abstract
Narrow&#8208;bandgap (NBG) mixed tin/lead&#8208;based (Sn&#8208;Pb) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have attracted extensive attention for use in tandem solar cells. However, they are still plagued by serious carrier recombination due to inferior film properties resulting from the alloying of Sn with Pb elements, which leads to p&#8208;type self&#8208;doping behaviors. This work reports an effective tin oxide (SnOx) doping strategy to produce high&#8208;quality Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films for utilization in efficient single&#8208;junction and tandem PSCs. SnOx can be naturally oxidized from tin diiodide raw powders and successfully incorporated into Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films. Consequently, Sn&#8208;Pb perovskite films doped with SnOx exhibit dramatically improved morphology, crystallization, absorption, and more interestingly, upward&#8208;shifted Fermi levels. The resulting narrow&#8208;bandgap Sn&#8208;Pb PSCs with natural SnOx doping have considerably reduced carrier recombination, therefore delivering a maximum power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 22.16% for single&#8208;junction cells and a remarkable PCE of 26.01% (with a steady&#8208;state efficiency of 25.33%) for two&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem cells. This work introduces a facile doping strategy for the manufacture of efficient single&#8208;junction narrow&#8208;bandgap PSCs and their tandem solar cells.

         <title>Single&#8208;Gate In&#8208;Transistor Readout of Current Superposition and Collapse Utilizing Quantum Tunneling and Ferroelectric Switching</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Superposition and collapse of nanostructured in&#8208;transistor current networks are demonstrated to be read and decoded by quantum tunneling and ferroelectric switching in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays and planar&#8208;gated nanofilms. The drain current output is therefore endowed with polymorphism due to the interplay of the polysilicon and Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanostructures.








Abstract
In nanostructure assemblies, the superposition of current paths forms microscopic electric circuits, and different circuit networks produce varying results, particularly when utilized as transistor channels for computing applications. However, the intricate nature of assembly networks and the winding paths of commensurate currents hinder standard circuit modeling. Inspired by the quantum collapse of superposition states for information decoding in quantum circuits, the implementation of analogous current path collapse to facilitate the detection of microscopic circuits by modifying their network topology is explored. Here, the superposition and collapse of current paths in gate&#8208;all&#8208;around polysilicon nanosheet arrays are demonstrated to enrich the computational resources within transistors by engineering the channel length and quantity. Switching the ferroelectric polarization of Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 gate dielectric, which drives these transistors out&#8208;of&#8208;equilibrium, decodes the output polymorphism through circuit topological modifications. Furthermore, a protocol for the single&#8208;electron readout of ferroelectric polarization is presented with tailoring the channel coherence. The introduction of lateral path superposition results into intriguing metal&#8208;to&#8208;insulator transitions due to transient behavior of ferroelectric switching. This ability to adjust the current networks within transistors and their interaction with ferroelectric polarization in polycrystalline nanostructures lays the groundwork for generating diverse current characteristics as potential physical databases for optimization&#8208;based computing.

A highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor is fabricated by designing Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V). The resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array with high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity could seamlessly unify with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new&#8208;generation human&#8211;machine interactions.








Abstract
Information&#8208;processing devices are the core components of modern electronics. Integrating them into textiles is the indispensable demand for electronic textiles to form close&#8208;loop functional systems. Memristors with crossbar configuration are regarded as promising building blocks to design woven information&#8208;processing devices that seamlessly unify with textiles. However, the memristors always suffer from severe temporal and spatial variations due to the random growth of conductive filaments during filamentary switching processes. Here, inspired by the ion nanochannels across synaptic membranes, a highly reliable textile&#8208;type memristor made of Pt/CuZnS memristive fiber with aligned nanochannels, showing small set voltage variation (&lt;5.6%) under ultralow set voltage (&#8776;0.089&#160;V), high on/off ratio (&#8776;106), and low power consumption (0.1&#160;nW), is reported. Experimental evidence indicate that nanochannels with abundant active S defects can anchor silver ions and confine their migrations to form orderly and efficient conductive filaments. Such memristive performances enable the resultant textile&#8208;type memristor array to have high device&#8208;to&#8208;device uniformity and process complex physiological data like brainwave signals with high recognition accuracy (95%). The textile&#8208;type memristor arrays are mechanically durable to withstand hundreds of bending and sliding deformations, and seamlessly unified with sensing, power&#8208;supplying, and displaying textiles/fibers to form all&#8208;textile integrated electronic systems for new generation human&#8208;machine interactions.

         <title>Large Anomalous Nernst Effects at Room Temperature in Fe3Pt Thin Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports the discovery of a large anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt, which also shows a remarkable coercive field of about 1300&#160;Oe. The results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE without an external magnetic field.








Abstract
Heat current in ferromagnets can generate a transverse electric voltage perpendicular to magnetization, known as anomalous Nernst effect (ANE). ANE originates intrinsically from the combination of large Berry curvature and density of states near the Fermi energy. It shows technical advantages over the conventional longitudinal Seebeck effect in converting waste heat to electricity due to its unique transverse geometry. However, materials showing giant ANE remain to be explored. Herein,&#160;&#160;a large ANE thermopower of Syx &#8776; 2 &#181;V K&#8722;1 at room temperature in ferromagnetic Fe3Pt epitaxial films is reported, which also show a giant transverse thermoelectric conductivity of &#945;yx &#8776; 4 A K&#8722;1&#160;m&#8722;1 and a remarkable coercive field of 1300&#160;Oe. The theoretical analysis reveals that the strong spin&#8208;orbit interaction in addition to the hybridization between Pt 5d and Fe 3d electrons leads to a series of distinct energy gaps and large Berry curvature in the Brillouin zone, which is the key for the large ANE. These results highlight the important roles of both Berry curvature and spin&#8208;orbit coupling in achieving large ANE at zero magnetic field, providing pathways to explore materials with giant transverse thermoelectric effect without an external magnetic field.

         <title>Aging Property of Halide Solid Electrolyte at the Cathode Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Halide solid electrolytes (SEs) are anticipated as high&#8208;voltage cathode compatible SEs with their superior oxidation stability. However, the calendar aging of halide&#8208;based all&#8208;solid&#8208;state&#8208;batteries reveal that halide SEs could be vulnerable to interfacial instability with layered oxide cathodes. This unexpected instability originates from the reduction tendency of metal ions in the SE, where Li3InCl6 with In3+ shows high aging susceptibility.








Abstract
Halide solid electrolytes have recently emerged as a promising option for cathode&#8208;compatible catholytes in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), owing to their superior oxidation stability at high voltage and their interfacial stability. However, their day&#8208; to month&#8208;scale aging at the cathode interface has remained unexplored until now, while its elucidation is indispensable for practical deployment. Herein, the stability of halide solid electrolytes (e.g., Li3InCl6) when used with conventional layered oxide cathodes during extended calendar aging is investigated. It is found that, contrary to their well&#8208;known oxidation stability, halide solid electrolytes can be vulnerable to reductive side reactions with oxide cathodes (e.g., LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2) in the long term. More importantly, the calendar aging at a low state of charge or as&#8208;fabricated state causes more significant degradation than at a high state of charge, in contrast to typical lithium&#8208;ion batteries, which are more susceptible to high&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;charge calendar aging. This unique characteristic of halide&#8208;based SSBs is related to the reduction propensity of metal ions in halide solid electrolytes and correlated to the formation of an interphase due to the reductive decomposition triggered by the oxide cathode in a lithiated state. This understanding of the long&#8208;term aging properties provides new guidelines for the development of cathode&#8208;compatible halide solid electrolytes.

         <title>Ultrasensitive Molecular Fingerprint Retrieval Using Strongly Detuned Overcoupled Plasmonic Nanoantennas</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantenna design strategy based on loss engineering is proposed. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the absorption fingerprints of various molecules are successfully detected and distinguished.








Abstract
Tailoring light&#8208;matter interactions via plasmonic nanoantennas (PNAs) has emerged as a breakthrough technology for spectroscopic applications. The detuning between molecular vibrations and plasmonic resonances, as a fundamental and inevitable optical phenomenon in light&#8208;matter interactions, reduces the interaction efficiency, resulting in a weak molecule sensing signal at the strong detuning state. Here, it is demonstrated that the low interaction efficiency from detuning can be tackled by overcoupled PNAs (OC&#8208;PNAs) with a high ratio of the radiative to intrinsic loss rates, which can be used for ultrasensitive spectroscopy at strong plasmonic&#8208;molecular detuning. In OC&#8208;PNAs, the ultrasensitive molecule signals are achieved within a wavelength detuning range of 248&#160;cm&#8722;1, which is 173&#160;cm&#8722;1 wider than previous works. Meanwhile, the OC&#8208;PNAs are immune to the distortion of molecular signals and maintain a lineshape consistent with the molecular signature fingerprint. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture the full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. In the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration, 13 kinds of molecules with some vibration fingerprints strongly detuning by the OC&#8208;PNAs are identified with 100% accuracy with the assistance of machine&#8208;learning algorithms. This work gains new insights into detuning&#8208;state nanophotonics for potential applications including spectroscopy and sensors.

Abstract
Severe issues including volume change and dendrite growth on sodium metal anodes hinder the pursuit of applicable high&#8208;energy&#8208;density sodium metal batteries. Herein, an in situ reaction approach is developed that takes metal&#8211;organic frameworks as nano&#8208;reactor and pore&#8208;former to produce a mesoporous host comprised of nitrogen&#8208;doped carbon fibers embedded with monodispersed Sn clusters (SnNCNFs). The hybrid host shows outstanding sodiophilicity that enables rapid Na infusion and ultralow Na nucleation overpotential of 2&#160;mV. Its porous structure holds a high Na content and guides uniform Na deposition. Such host provides favorable Na plating/stripping with an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.96% over 2000 cycles (at 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 3&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2). The Na&#8208;infused SnNCNF anode delivers extreme Na utilization of 86% in symmetric cells (at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 10&#160;mA h cm&#8722;2), outstanding rate capability and cycle life in Na&#8208;SnNCNF||Na3V2(PO4)3 full cells (at 1 A g&#8722;1 for over 1000 cycles with capacity retention of 92.1%). Furthermore, high&#8208;energy/power&#8208;density anode&#8208;less and anode&#8208;free Na cells are achieved. This work presents an effective heteroatom&#8208;doping approach for fabricating multifunctional porous carbon materials and developing high&#8208;performance metal batteries.

         <title>Ionic Accumulation as a Diagnostic Tool in Perovskite Solar Cells: Characterizing Band Alignment with Rapid Voltage Pulses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To accelerate the optimisation of perovskite solar cell efficiencies, a pulsed measurement technique that reconstructs the current&#8208;voltage&#160;curve for a range of stabilization biases is developed to probe the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers. Determining the intersection of low and high applied bias behaviour allows the study of complete devices employing a simple source meter.








Abstract
Despite record&#8208;breaking devices, interfaces in perovskite solar cells are still poorly understood, inhibiting further progress. Their mixed ionic&#8208;electronic nature results in compositional variations at the interfaces, depending on the history of externally applied biases. This makes it difficult to measure the band energy alignment of charge extraction layers accurately. As a result, the field often resorts to a trial&#8208;and&#8208;error process to optimize these interfaces. Current approaches are typically carried out in a vacuum and on incomplete cells, hence values may not reflect those found in working devices. To address this, a pulsed measurement technique characterizing the electrostatic potential energy drop across the perovskite layer in a functioning device is developed. This method reconstructs the current&#8208;voltage (JV) curve for a range of stabilization biases, holding the ion distribution &#8220;static&#8221; during subsequent rapid voltage pulses. Two different regimes are observed: at low biases, the reconstructed JV curve is &#8220;s&#8208;shaped&#8221;, whereas, at high biases, typical diode&#8208;shaped curves are returned. Using drift&#8208;diffusion simulations, it is demonstrated that the intersection of the two regimes reflects&#160;the band offsets at the interfaces. This approach effectively allows measurements of interfacial energy level alignment in a complete device under illumination and without the need for expensive vacuum equipment.

         <title>Metallic Powder Promotes Nitridation Kinetics for Facile Synthesis of (Oxy)Nitride Photocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of metallic (oxy)nitrides can be synthesized with reduced nitridation temperature and a shortened nitridation period due to the enhanced nitridation kinetics, benefiting from the nitridation assistance of metallic powder with low work function.








Abstract
Nitrogen&#8208;containing semiconductors (including metal nitrides, metal oxynitrides, and nitrogen&#8208;doped metal oxides) have been widely researched for their application in energy conversion and environmental purification because of their unique characteristics; however, their synthesis generally encounters significant challenges owing to sluggish nitridation kinetics. Herein, a metallic&#8208;powder&#8208;assisted nitridation method is developed that effectively promotes the kinetics of nitrogen insertion into oxide precursors and exhibits good generality. By employing metallic powders with low work functions as electronic modulators, a series of oxynitrides (i.e., LnTaON2 (Ln = La, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Gd), Zr2ON2, and LaTiO2N) can be prepared at lower nitridation temperatures and shorter nitridation periods to obtain comparable or even lower defect concentrations compared to those of the conventional thermal nitridation method, leading to superior photocatalytic performance. Moreover, some novel nitrogen&#8208;doped oxides (i.e., SrTiO3&#8722;xNy and Y2Zr2O7&#8722;xNy) with visible&#8208;light responses can be exploited. As revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the nitridation kinetics are enhanced via the effective electron transfer from the metallic powder to the oxide precursors, reducing the activation energy of nitrogen insertion. The modified nitridation route developed in this work&#160;is an alternative method for preparing (oxy)nitride&#8208;based materials for energy/environment&#8208;related heterogeneous catalysis.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
By precisely and continuously controlling the surface tensile strain of Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir atomic layers, core/shell nanocrystals with 1.7% tensile strain relative to Ir demonstrate optimized d&#8208;band centers and boosted hydrogen evolution performance.








Abstract
Strain engineering has been utilized as an effective approach to regulate the binding of reaction intermediates and modify catalytic behavior on noble metal nanocatalysts. However, the continuous, precise control of strain for a depiction of strain&#8208;activity correlation remains a challenge. Herein, Pd&#8208;based nanooctahedrons coated with two Ir overlayers are constructed, and subject to different postsynthetic treatments to alter the amount of H intercalated into Pd core for achieving three different surface strains (o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.2%, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7%, and o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;2.1% NPs). It is demonstrated that the catalytic performances of o&#8208;Pd/Ir NPs display a volcano&#8208;shaped curve against strains toward the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Specifically, o&#8208;Pd/Ir&#8208;1.7% NPs exhibit superior catalytic performance with a mass activity of 9.38 A mgIr&#8722;1 at &#8722;0.02&#160;V versus reversible hydrogen electrode, 10.8&#8208; and 18.8&#8208;fold higher than those of commercial Pt/C and Ir/C, respectively, making it one of the most active HER electrocatalysts reported to date. Density function theory calculations verify that the moderate tensile strain on Ir(111) surfaces plays a pivotal role in optimizing the H binding energy. This work highlights a new strategy for precise control over the surface strain of nanocrystals for more efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>A Light&#8208;Programmed Rewritable Lattice&#8208;Mediated Multistate Memory for High&#8208;Density Data Storage</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;time programmable non&#8208;volatile memory is realized by utilizing light programming on a ReS2 device. The device exhibits more than 128 extremely stable states with linearly increasing conductance and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability. This device represents a significant contribution to memory technology by offering the ability to store information in multistate memory and enabling filter&#8208;free color image recorder applications.








Abstract
Mainstream non&#8208;volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase&#8208;change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long&#8208;term data storage.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mainstream non-volatile memory (NVM) devices based on floating gate structures or phase-change/ferroelectric materials face inherent limitations that compromise their suitability for long-term data storage. To address this challenge, a novel memory device based on light-programmed lattice engineering of thin rhenium disulfide&#160;(ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ) flakes is proposed. By inducing sulfur vacancies in the ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; channel through light illumination, the device's electrical conductivity is modified accordingly and multiple conductance states for data storage therefore are generated. The device exhibits more than 128 distinct states with linearly increasing conductance, corresponding to a sevenfold increase in storage density. Through further optimization to achieve atomic-level precision in defect creation, it is possible to achieve even higher storage densities. These states are extremely stable in vacuum or inert ambient showing long retention of &amp;gt;10 years, while they can be erased upon exposure to the air. The ReS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; memory device can maintain its stability over multiple program-erase operation cycles and shows superior wavelength discrimination capability for incident light in the range of 405&#8211;785&#160;nm.

         <title>As&#8208;Grown Miniaturized True Zero&#8208;Order Waveplates Based on Low&#8208;Dimensional Ferrocene Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ferrocene crystals are grown using a bottom&#8208;up method and self&#8208;assembled at liquid&#8211;liquid capillary interfaces. Their unique molecular arrangement results in high birefringence, low dichroism, and low loss over a broad range (&#8776;550&#160;nm &#8211; 20&#160;&#181;m). Facet orientations along the b&#8208;axis are synthesized at the acetone&#8211;water interface, and the naturally grown a&#8211;c planes, exhibiting the highest birefringence and suit for on&#8208;chip applications.








Abstract
As basic optical elements, waveplates with anisotropic electromagnetic responses are imperative for manipulating light polarization. Conventional waveplates are manufactured from bulk crystals (e.g., quartz and calcite) through a series of precision cutting and grinding steps, which typically result in large size, low yield, and high cost. In this study, a bottom&#8208;up method is used to grow ferrocene crystals with large anisotropy to demonstrate self&#8208;assembled ultrathin true zero&#8208;order waveplates without additional machining processing, which is particularly suited for nanophotonic integration. The van der Waals ferrocene crystals exhibit high birefringence (&#916;n (experiment) = 0.149&#8197; &#177; &#8197;0.002 at 636&#160;nm), low dichroism &#916;&#954; (experiment) = &#8722;0.0007 at 636&#160;nm), and a potentially broad operating range (550&#160;nm to 20&#160;&#181;m) as suggested by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. In addition, the grown waveplate's highest and the lowest principal axes (n1 and n3, respectively) are in the a&#8211;c plane, where the fast axis is along one natural edge of the ferrocene crystal, rendering them readily usable. The as&#8208;grown, wavelength&#8208;scale&#8208;thick waveplate allows the development of further miniaturized systems via tandem integration.

         <title>Highest&#8208;Efficiency Flexible Perovskite Solar Module by Interface Engineering for Efficient Charge&#8208;Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A record efficiency of 18.71% for flexible perovskite solar modules is achieved, with negligible hysteresis and excellent mechanical stability, by employing interface engineering. The good performance is due to the reduced defect density, better energy band alignment, good wettable surface, and the provided&#160;charge&#8208;transfer channel between the perovskite and the interface.








Abstract
The electron&#8208;transport layer (ETL) plays an important role in improving the performance of flexible perovskite solar cells (F&#8208;PSCs). Herein, a room&#8208;temperature&#8208;processed SnO2:OH ETL is demonstrated, that exhibits reduced defect density, in particular lower oxygen vacancy concentration, with better energy band alignment and more wettable surface for quality perovskite deposition. More importantly, an efficient electron&#8208;transfer channel is produced between the ETL and the perovskite layer due to the formation of hydrogen bonds at the interface, resulting in enhanced electron extraction from the perovskite. As a result, the efficiency of a large&#8208;area (36.50 cm2) flexible perovskite solar module based on MAPbI3 is increased to as high as 18.71%; this is thought to be the highest reported PCE value for flexible perovskite solar modules to date. In addition, it exhibits high durability while maintaining over 83% of its initial PCE after flexing test cycles. Further, F&#8208;PSCs with SnO2:OH show remarkably long&#8208;term stability, owing to a high quality of the perovskite film and a strong coupling between the SnO2:OH and perovskite layer caused by hydrogen bonds, which successfully inhibits moisture permeation.

         <title>Revolutionizing Porous Liquids: Stabilization and Structural Engineering Achieved by a Surface Deposition Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A surface deposition approach is demonstrated to afford type III porous liquids (PLs) with ultra&#8208;high stability and surface structure modification by leveraging the expeditious and homogeneous precipitation of selected metal salts (e.g., AgBr and BaSO4). Ag(I)&#8208; or Ba(II)&#8208;functionalized zeolite nanosheets and ionic liquids with Br&#8722; or SO42&#8722; anion are deployed to produce PLs with enhanced gas storage and conversion.








Abstract
Facile approaches capable of constructing stable and structurally diverse porous liquids (PLs) that can deliver high&#8208;performance applications are a long&#8208;standing, captivating, and challenging research area that requires significant attention. Herein, a facile surface deposition strategy is demonstrated to afford diverse type III&#8208;PLs possessing ultra&#8208;stable dispersion, external structure modification, and enhanced performance in gas storage and transformation by leveraging the expeditious and uniform precipitation of selected metal salts. The Ag(I) species&#8208;modified zeolite nanosheets are deployed as the porous host to construct type III&#8208;PLs with ionic liquids (ILs) containing bromide anion , leading to stable dispersion driven by the formation of AgBr nanoparticles. The as&#8208;afforded type&#8208;III PLs display promising performance in CO2 capture/conversion and ethylene/ethane separation. Property and performance of the as&#8208;produced PLs can be tuned by the cation structure of the ILs, which can be harnessed to achieve polarity reversal of the porous host via ionic exchange. The surface deposition procedure can be further extended to produce PLs from Ba(II)&#8208;functionalized zeolite and ILs containing [SO4]2&#8722; anion driven by the formation of BaSO4 salts. The as&#8208;produced PLs are featured by well&#8208;maintained crystallinity of the porous host, good fluidity and stability, enhanced gas uptake capacity, and attractive performance in small gas molecule utilization.

         <title>Sequential&#8208;Stimuli Induced Stepwise&#8208;Response of Pyridylpyrenes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A unique phenomenon of sequential&#8208;stimuli induced stepwise&#8208;response generated from a single&#8208;component organic material is reported. In contrast to multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy integrated into one single&#8208;component material. This work provides a fundamental design strategy for new generation of high&#8208;performance stimuli&#8208;responsive materials.








Abstract
Stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, especially multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, can sense external stimuli such as light, heat, and force, have shown great potential in drug delivery, data storage, encryption, energy&#8208;harvesting, and artificial intelligence. Conventional multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials are sensitive to each independent stimulus, causing losses in the diversity and accuracy of the identification for practical application. Herein, a unique phenomenon of sequential&#8208;stimuli induced stepwise&#8208;response generated from elaborately designed single&#8208;component organic materials is reported, which shows large bathochromic shifts up to 5800&#160;cm&#8722;1 under sequential stimuli of force and light. In contrast to multi&#8208;stimuli&#8208;responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy to be integrated into one single&#8208;component material. The molecular keypad lock is built based on these materials, pointing promising to a future for this logical response in significant practical applications.

     alt="Sequential-Stimuli Induced Stepwise-Response of Pyridylpyrenes"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A unique phenomenon of sequential-stimuli induced stepwise-response generated from a single-component organic material is reported. In contrast to multi-stimuli-responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy integrated into one single-component material. This work provides a fundamental design strategy for new generation of high-performance stimuli-responsive materials.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stimuli-responsive materials, especially multi-stimuli-responsive materials, can sense external stimuli such as light, heat, and force, have shown great potential in drug delivery, data storage, encryption, energy-harvesting, and artificial intelligence. Conventional multi-stimuli-responsive materials are sensitive to each independent stimulus, causing losses in the diversity and accuracy of the identification for practical application. Herein, a unique phenomenon of sequential-stimuli induced stepwise-response generated from elaborately designed single-component organic materials is reported, which shows large bathochromic shifts up to 5800&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; under sequential stimuli of force and light. In contrast to multi-stimuli-responsive materials, the response of these materials strictly relies on the sequence of stimuli, allowing logicality, rigidity, and accuracy to be integrated into one single-component material. The molecular keypad lock is built based on these materials, pointing promising to a future for this logical response in significant practical applications. This breakthrough gives a new drive to classical stimuli-responsiveness and provides a fundamental design strategy for new generations of high-performance stimuli-responsive materials.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Longitudinal Through&#8208;Hole Architecture for Efficient and Thickness&#8208;Insensitive Semitransparent Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel semitransparent organic solar cell constructed by longitudinal through&#8208;hole strategy is proposed to eliminate the dependence of transparent devices on ultrathin active layer and electrode and applied into thick&#8208;film devices with record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency, which greatly expands the printing process window. Additionally, through&#8208;hole allows the organic materials to deform slightly and disperse extrusion stresses, thus exhibiting excellent flexural endurance.








Abstract
Semi&#8208;transparent organic solar cells (ST&#8208;OSCs) have great potential for application in vehicle&#8208; or building&#8208;integrated solar energy harvesting. Ultrathin active layers and electrodes are typically utilized to guarantee high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high average visible transmittance (AVT)&#160;simultaneously; however, such ultrathin parts are unsuitable for industrial high&#8208;throughput manufacturing. In this study, ST&#8208;OSCs are fabricated using a longitudinal through&#8208;hole architecture to achieve functional region division and to eliminate the dependence on ultrathin films. A complete circuit that vertically corresponds to the silver grid is responsible for obtaining high PCE, and the longitudinal through&#8208;holes embedded in it allow most of the light to pass through,where the overall transparency is associated with the through&#8208;hole specification rather than the thicknesses of active layer and electrode. Excellent photovoltaic performance over a wide range of transparency (9.80&#8211;60.03%), with PCEs ranging from 6.04% to 15.34% is achieved. More critically, this architecture allows printable 300&#8208;nm&#8208;thick devices to achieve a record&#8208;breaking light utilization efficiency (LUE) of 3.25%, and enables flexible ST&#8208;OSCs to exhibit better flexural endurance by dispersing the extrusion stress into the through&#8208;holes. This study paves the way for fabricating high&#8208;performance ST&#8208;OSCs and shows great promise for the commercialization of organic photovoltaics.

         <title>Phonon Polaritonics in Broad Terahertz Frequency Range with Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 offers low&#8208;loss, ultra&#8208;broadband, and temperature insensitive phonon&#8211;polaritons in the frequency range of 7&#8211;13&#160;THz within the &#8220;new terahertz gap&#8221;. Proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept phonon&#8211;polaritonic concentrators are experimentally realized to enhance electric field to the order of GV m&#8208;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics for potential applications in non&#8208;equilibrium quantum materials and infrared molecular spectroscopy.








Abstract
Photonics in the frequency range of 5&#8211;15&#160;terahertz (THz) potentially open a new realm of quantum materials manipulation and biosensing. This range, sometimes called &#8220;the new terahertz gap&#8221;, is traditionally difficult to access due to prevalent phonon absorption bands in solids. Low&#8208;loss phonon&#8211;polariton materials may realize sub&#8208;wavelength, on&#8208;chip photonic devices, but typically operate in mid&#8208;infrared frequencies with narrow bandwidths and are difficult to manufacture on a large scale. Here, for the first time, quantum paraelectric SrTiO3 enables broadband surface phonon&#8211;polaritonic devices in 7&#8211;13&#160;THz. As a proof of concept, polarization&#8208;independent field concentrators are designed and fabricated to locally enhance intense, multicycle THz pulses by a factor of 6 and increase the spectral intensity by over 90 times. The time&#8208;resolved electric field inside the concentrators is experimentally measured by THz&#8208;field&#8208;induced second harmonic generation. Illuminated by a table&#8208;top light source, the average field reaches 0.5&#160;GV&#160;m&#8722;1 over a large volume resolvable by far&#8208;field optics. These&#160;results potentially enable scalable THz photonics with high breakdown fields made of various commercially available phonon&#8211;polariton crystals for studying driven phases in quantum materials and nonlinear molecular spectroscopy.

         <title>Implantable Zinc&#8211;Oxygen Battery for In Situ Electrical Stimulation&#8208;Promoted Neural Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A tubular implantable zinc&#8211;oxygen battery is designed to work as a power source in vivo. It exhibits a high volumetric energy density of 231.4&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 in vivo and can be wrapped around a nerve to provide electrical stimulation with a minimal size of 0.86&#160;mm3. Animal experiments demonstrate the battery&#8208;based nerve conduit promotes the regeneration of injured sciatic nerve.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation is a promising strategy for treating neural diseases. However, current energy suppliers cannot provide effective power for in situ electrical stimulation. Here, an implantable tubular zinc&#8211;oxygen battery is reported as the power source for in situ electrical stimulation during the neural repair. The battery exhibited a high volumetric energy density of 231.4&#160;mWh&#160;cm&#8722;3 based on the entire anode and cathode in vivo. Due to its superior electrochemical properties and biosafety, the battery can be directly wrapped around the nerve to provide in situ electrical stimulation with a minimal size of 0.86&#160;mm3. The cell and animal experiments demonstrated that the zinc&#8211;oxygen battery&#8208;based nerve tissue engineering conduit effectively promoted regeneration of the injured long&#8208;segment sciatic nerve, proving its promising applications for powering implantable neural electronics in the future.

         <title>Enhanced Nitrate&#8208;to&#8208;Ammonia Efficiency over Linear Assemblies of Copper&#8208;Cobalt Nanophases Stabilized by Redox Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemical redox&#8208;driven linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm CuCo nanocrystals, coupled with a specifically designed protective redox polymer, is first reported for designing an inorganic&#8208;organic hybrid catalyst with enzyme&#8208;like properties, which enables enhanced nitrate (NO3&#8722;) adsorption and tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to ammonia (NH3) with a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% at low overpotentials, leading to a record&#8208;high half&#8208;cell energy efficiency of &#8776;42.0%.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;powered nitrate (NO3&#8722;) reduction reaction (NO3RR) offers a net&#8208;zero carbon route to the realization of high ammonia (NH3) productivity. However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half&#8208;cell EE commonly &lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO3&#8722; binding affinity and sluggish NO3RR kinetics. To alleviate this, a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub&#8208;5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub&#8208;20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons is suggested. The theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu&#8208;Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO3&#8722; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO3&#8722; to NH3, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu&#8208;Co sites at sub&#8208;5&#160;nm distance. In situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative nitrogen dioxide (NO2). As a result, a stable NO3RR with a current density of &#8776;450&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved, a Faradaic efficiency of &gt;97% for the formation of NH3, and an unprecedented half&#8208;cell EE of &#8776;42%.

However, this route suffers from low energy efficiency (EE, with a half-cell EE commonly &amp;lt;36%), since high overpotentials are required to overcome the weak NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; binding affinity and sluggish NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR kinetics. To alleviate this, a rational catalyst design strategy that involves the linear assembly of sub-5&#160;nm Cu/Co nanophases into sub-20&#160;nm thick nanoribbons is suggested. The theoretical and experimental studies show that the Cu-Co nanoribbons, similar to enzymes, enable strong NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; adsorption and rapid tandem catalysis of NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, owing to their richly exposed binary phase boundaries and adjacent Cu-Co sites at sub-5&#160;nm distance. In situ Raman spectroscopy further reveals that at low applied overpotentials, the Cu/Co nanophases are rapidly activated and subsequently stabilized by a specifically designed redox polymer that in situ scavenges intermediately formed highly oxidative nitrogen dioxide (NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). As a result, a stable NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;RR with a current density of &#8776;450&#160;mA&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; is achieved, a Faradaic efficiency of &amp;gt;97% for the formation of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and an unprecedented half-cell EE of &#8776;42%.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Robust red emission phosphor Pt(II) complexes with rigid molecular configuration, short&#8208;excited lifetimes and high PLQYs enable high&#8208;performance red OLEDs with EQEmax over 30% and T90@1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8208;2 over 14000&#160;h.









Abstract
Designing mononuclear platinum(II) complexes that do not rely on intermolecular aggregation for high&#8208;performance red organic light&#8208;emitting diodes remains a formidable challenge. In this work, three robust red&#8208;emitting Pt(II) complexes are&#160;created by utilizing a rigid 4&#8208;coordination configuration, where the ligands are&#160;formed by linking electron&#8208;donor of triphenylamine (TPA) moieties with electron&#8208;acceptor of pyridine, isoquinoline, and/or &#948;&#8208;carboline units. The thermal stability, electrochemical, and photophysical properties of the complexes are&#160;thoroughly examined. The complexes display efficient red phosphorescence, with high photoluminescence quantum yields and short excited lifetimes. The OLEDs dope with these complexes exhibit high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEs) of up to 31.8% with minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off even at high brightness. Significantly, the devices demonstrate exceptional long operational lifetime, with a T90 lifetime of over 14000&#160;h at initial luminance of 1000&#160;cd&#160;m&#8722;2, indicating the potential for these complexes to be practically utilizes.

         <title>Evidence for Anisotropic Superconductivity Beyond Pauli Limit in Infinite&#8208;Layer Lanthanum Nickelates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports that the superconductivity is intrinsically anisotropic in lanthanum nickelates with enhanced crystalline quality and superconductivity by systematic magnetotransport measurements. Therefore, the quasi&#8208;2D hole bands from Ni may be dominant in formation of Cooper pairs and a cuprate&#8208;like picture may be still valid in describing the superconductivity in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates.








Abstract
After being expected to be a promising analog to cuprates for decades, superconductivity has recently been discovered in infinite&#8208;layer nickelates, providing new opportunities to explore mechanisms of high&#8208;temperature superconductivity. However, in sharp contrast to the single&#8208;band and anisotropic superconductivity in cuprates, nickelates exhibit a multi&#8208;band electronic structure and an unexpected isotropic superconductivity as reported recently, which challenges the cuprate&#8208;like picture in nickelates. Here, it is shown that strong anisotropic magnetotransport behaviors exist in La&#8208;based nickelate films with enhanced crystallinity and superconductivity (Tconset$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{onset}}}$ = 18.8 K, Tczero$T_{\rm{c}}^{{\rm{zero}}}$ = 16.5 K). The upper critical fields are anisotropic and violate the estimated Bardeen&#8211;Cooper&#8211;Schrieffer (BCS) Pauli limit (HPauli,&#956;=1&#956;B=1.86&#215;Tc,H=0${H}_{\mathrm{Pauli},\mu =1{\mu}_{B}}=1.86\ensuremath{\times{}}{T}_{\mathrm{c},H=0}$) for in&#8208;plane magnetic fields. Moreover, the anisotropic superconductivity is further manifested by the cusp&#8208;like peak of the angle&#8208;dependent Tc and the vortex motion anisotropy under external magnetic fields.

         <title>Intense Pulsed Light Thermal Treatment of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas Heterostructured Films Resulting in Extreme Magnetoelectric Coupling of over 20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1</title>

         <dc:description>
The fabrication of Pb(Zr,Ti)O3/Metglas magnetoelectric (ME) film heterostructures with an ultrahigh ME coupling by employing the synergetic approach of combining aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light radiation, is reported.








Abstract
Magnetoelectric (ME) film composites consisting of piezoelectric and magnetostrictive materials are promising candidates for application in magnetic field sensors, energy harvesters, and ME antennas. Conventionally, high&#8208;temperature annealing is required to crystallize piezoelectric films, restricting the use of heat&#8208;sensitive magnetostrictive substrates that enhance ME coupling. Herein, a synergetic approach is demonstrated for fabricating ME film composites that combines aerosol deposition and instantaneous thermal treatment based on intense pulsed light (IPL) radiation to form piezoelectric Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 (PZT) thick films on an amorphous Metglas substrate. IPL rapidly anneals PZT films within a few milliseconds without damaging the underlying Metglas. To optimize the IPL irradiation conditions, the temperature distribution inside the PZT/Metglas film is determined using transient photothermal computational simulation. The PZT/Metglas films are annealed using different IPL pulse durations to determine the structure&#8211;property relationship. IPL treatment results in an enhanced crystallinity of the PZT, thus improving the dielectric, piezoelectric, and ME properties of the composite films. An ultrahigh off&#8208;resonance ME coupling (&#8776;20&#160;V&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;Oe&#8722;1) is obtained for the PZT/Metglas film that is IPL annealed at a pulse width of 0.75&#160;ms (an order of magnitude higher than that reported for other ME films), confirming the potential for next&#8208;generation, miniaturized, and high&#8208;performance ME devices.

         <title>High Toughness Combined with High Strength in Oxide Ceramic Nanofibers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers, which exhibit high strength and high toughness simultaneously owing to their ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure.








Abstract
Traditional oxide ceramics are inherently brittle and highly sensitive to defects, making them vulnerable to failure under external stress. As such, endowing these materials with high strength and high toughness simultaneously is crucial to improve their performance in most safety&#8208;critical applications. Fibrillation of the ceramic materials and further refinement of the fiber diameter, as realized by electrospinning, are expected to achieve the transformation from brittleness to flexibility owing to the structural uniqueness. Currently, the synthesis of electrospun oxide ceramic nanofibers must rely on an organic polymer template to regulate the spinnability of the inorganic sol, whose thermal decomposition during ceramization will inevitably lead to pore defects, and seriously weaken the mechanical properties of the final nanofibers. Here, a self&#8208;templated electrospinning strategy is proposed for the formation of oxide ceramic nanofibers without adding any organic polymer template. An example is given to show that individual silica nanofibers have an ideally homogeneous, dense, and defect&#8208;free structure, with tensile strength as high as 1.41&#160;GPa and toughness up to 34.29&#160;MJ&#160;m&#8722;3, both of which are far superior to the counterparts prepared by polymer&#8208;templated electrospinning. This work provides a new strategy to develop oxide ceramic materials that are strong and tough.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Site W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP Catalysts for Active and Selective Nitrate Conversion to Ammonia in a Broad Concentration Window</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A cascade catalyst of [W&#8208;O]&#8208;doped CoP nanosheets (0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF) is designed to effectively separate the active sites of nitrate reduction and hydrolysis by dual sites of Co and [W&#8208;O] as well as optimize proton supply for nitrate reduction, resulting in high ammonia (NH3) yield and selectivity for nitrate reduction reaction (NO3&#8211;RR) in a wide NO3&#8211; concentration window.








Abstract
Environmentally friendly electrochemical reduction of contaminated nitrate to ammonia (NO3&#8722;RR) is a promising solution for large quantity ammonia (NH3) production, which, however, is a complex multi&#8208;reaction process involving coordination between different reaction intermediates of nitrate reduction and water decomposition&#8208;provided active hydrogen (Hads) species. Here, a dual&#8208;site catalyst of [W&#8208;O] group&#8208;doped CoP nanosheets (0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF) has been designed to synergistically catalyze the NO3&#8722;RR and water decomposition, especially the reactions between the intermediates of NO3&#8722;RR and water decomposition&#8208;provided Hads species. This catalytic NO3&#8722;RR exhibits an extremely high NH3 yield of 80.92&#160;mg h&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2 and a Faradaic efficiency (FE) of 95.2% in 1&#160;m KOH containing 0.1&#160;m NO3&#8722;. Significantly, 0.6W&#8208;O&#8208;CoP@NF presents greatly enhanced NH3 yield and FE in a wide NO3&#8722; concentration ranges of 0.001&#8211;0.1&#160;m compared to the reported. The excellent NO3&#8722;RR performance is attributed to a synergistic catalytic effect between [W&#8208;O] and CoP active sites, in which the doped [W&#8208;O] group promotes the water decomposition to supply abundant Hads, and meanwhile modulates the electronic structure of Co for strengthened adsorption of Hads and the hydrogen (H2) release prevention, resultantly facilitating the NO3&#8722;RR. Finally, a Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722; battery has been assembled to simultaneously achieve three functions: electricity output, ammonia production, and nitrate treatment in wastewater.

         <title>Rational Design and Acoustic Assembly of Human Cerebral Cortex&#8208;Like Microtissues from hiPSC&#8208;Derived Neural Progenitors and Neurons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Acoustic assembly technique is employed to generate human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models by reverse engineering and bionic design, including the six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues with herpes simplex virus type I&#160;infection show pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease, including the expression of A&#946;, neuronal loss, and dysfunctional synaptic connections.









Abstract
Development of biologically relevant and clinically relevant human cerebral cortex models is demanded by mechanistic studies of human cerebral cortex&#8208;associated neurological diseases and discovery of preclinical neurological drug candidates. Here, rational design of human&#8211;sourced brain&#8208;like cortical tissue models is demonstrated by reverse engineering and bionic design. To implement this design, the acoustic assembly technique is employed to assemble hiPSC&#8208;derived neural progenitors and neurons separately in a label&#8208;free and contact&#8208;free manner followed by subsequent neural differentiation and culture. The generated microtissues encapsulate the neuronal microanatomy of human cerebral&#8208;cortex tissue that contains six&#8208;layered neuronal architecture, a 400&#8208;&#181;m interlayer distance, synaptic connections between interlayers, and neuroelectrophysiological transmission. Furthermore, these microtissues are infected with herpes simplex virus type I (HSV&#8208;1)&#160;virus, and the HSV&#8208;induced pathogenesis associated with Alzheimer's disease is determined, including neuron loss and the expression of A&#946;. Overall, a high&#8208;fidelity human&#8208;relevant in vitro histotypic model is provided for the&#160;cerebral cortex, which will facilitate wide applications in probing the mechanisms of neurodegenerative diseases and screening the candidates for neuroprotective agents.

         <title>Metasurfaces&#8208;Driven Hyperspectral Imaging via Multiplexed Plasmonic Resonance Energy Transfer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multiplexed metasurface&#8211;driven plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) hyperspectral imaging is created to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra over the entire visible range, by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and optical effects of metasurface clusters, are designed, fabricated, characterized by their full dark&#8208;field coloration, and are demonstrated for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.








Abstract
Obtaining single&#8211;molecular&#8211;level fingerprints of biomolecules and electron&#8211;transfer dynamic imaging in living cells are critically demanded in postgenomic life sciences and medicine. However, the possible solution called plasmonic resonance energy transfer (PRET) spectroscopy remains challenging due to the fixed scattering spectrum of a plasmonic nanoparticle and limited multiplexing. Here, multiplexed metasurfaces&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging, to probe biological light&#8211;matter interactions, is reported. Pixelated metasurfaces with engineered scattering spectra are first designed over the entire visible range by the precision nanoengineering of gap plasmon and grating effects of metasurface clusters. Pixelated metasurfaces are created and their full dark&#8208;field coloration is optically characterized with visible color palettes and high&#8208;resolution color printings of the art pieces. Furthermore, three different biomolecules (i.e., chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and cytochrome c) are applied on metasurfaces for color palettes to obtain selective molecular fingerprint imaging due to the unique biological light&#8211;matter interactions with application&#8208;specific biomedical metasurfaces. This metasurface&#8208;driven PRET hyperspectral imaging will open up a new path for multiplexed real&#8208;time molecular sensing and imaging methods.

         <title>Organic Solar Cells with Over 19% Efficiency Enabled by a 2D&#8208;Conjugated Non&#8208;Fullerene Acceptor Featuring Favorable Electronic and Aggregation Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of phenazine&#8208;fused core on AQx&#8208;18 affords a 2D&#8208;congjugated non&#8208;fullerene acceptor with favorable electronic and aggregation structures. AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based devices exhibit a PCE of 19.1%, which is among the highest value ever reported for organic solar cells (OSCs) with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. Such a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy is promising for next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
The &#960;&#8208;expansion of non&#8208;fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine&#8208;tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy to design new non&#8208;fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;16, the &#960;&#8208;expanded phenazine&#8208;fused cores of AQx&#8208;18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing Voc, Jsc, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx&#8208;18&#8208;based ternary devices fabricated via a two&#8208;in&#8208;one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high Voc of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &#960;&#8208;expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non&#8208;fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-expansion of non-fullerene acceptors is a promising method for boosting the organic photovoltaic performance by allowing the fine-tuning of electronic structures and molecular packing. In this work, highly efficient organic solar cells (OSCs) are fabricated using a 2D &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-expansion strategy to design new non-fullerene acceptors. Compared with the quinoxaline-fused cores of AQx-16, the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-expanded phenazine-fused cores of AQx-18 induce more ordered and compact packing between adjacent molecules, affording an optimized morphology with rational phase separation in the blend film. This facilitates efficient exciton dissociation and inhibited charge recombination. Consequently, a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 18.2% with simultaneously increasing &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt;, &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;sc&lt;/sub&gt;, and fill factor is achieved in the AQx-18-based binary OSCs. Significantly, AQx-18-based ternary devices fabricated via a two-in-one alloy acceptor strategy exhibit a superior PCE of 19.1%, one of the highest values ever reported for OSCs, along with a high &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;oc&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.928&#160;V. These results indicate the importance of the 2D &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-expansion strategy for the delicate regulation of the electronic structures and crystalline behaviors of the non-fullerene acceptors to achieve superior photovoltaic performance, aimed at significantly promoting further development of OSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Volumetric Printing Across Melt Electrowritten Scaffolds Fabricates Multi&#8208;Material Living Constructs with Tunable Architecture and Mechanics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of melt electrowriting and volumetric bioprinting (VolMEW) improves the mechanical performance of the structures while maintaining high printing resolution, design freedom, and choice of material. VolMEW enables the fabrication of multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cell, functional scaffolds with physiological relevance in seconds.








Abstract
Major challenges in biofabrication revolve around capturing the complex, hierarchical composition of native tissues. However, individual 3D printing techniques have limited capacity to produce composite biomaterials with multi&#8208;scale resolution. Volumetric bioprinting recently emerged as a paradigm&#8208;shift in biofabrication. This ultrafast, light&#8208;based technique sculpts cell&#8208;laden hydrogel bioresins into 3D structures in a layerless fashion, providing enhanced design freedom over conventional bioprinting. However, it yields prints with low mechanical stability, since soft, cell&#8208;friendly hydrogels are used. Herein, the possibility to converge volumetric bioprinting with melt electrowriting, which excels at patterning microfibers, is shown for the fabrication of tubular hydrogel&#8208;based composites with enhanced mechanical behavior. Despite including non&#8208;transparent melt electrowritten scaffolds in the volumetric printing process, high&#8208;resolution bioprinted structures are successfully achieved. Tensile, burst, and bending mechanical properties of printed tubes are tuned altering the electrowritten mesh design, resulting in complex, multi&#8208;material tubular constructs with customizable, anisotropic geometries that better mimic intricate biological tubular structures. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, engineered tubular structures are obtained by building trilayered cell&#8208;laden vessels, and features (valves, branches, fenestrations) that can be rapidly printed using this hybrid approach. This multi&#8208;technology convergence offers a new toolbox for manufacturing hierarchical and mechanically tunable multi&#8208;material living structures.

         <title>Understanding the Role of Removable Solid Additives: Selective Interaction Contributes to Vertical Component Distributions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solid additives with varied electrostatic potential and steric hinderance are introduced to investigate the impact of both evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. The removal of solid additives can drive the more strongly interacting component upward to the surface, delivering a high performance of 19.2%, among the highest efficiencies achieved in organic solar cells.








Abstract
Sequentially deposited organic solar cells (SD&#8208;OSCs) have attracted great attention owing to their ability in achieving a more favorable, vertically phase&#8208;separated morphology to avoid the accumulation of counter charges at absorber/transporting layer interfaces. However, the processing of SD&#8208;OSCs is still quite challenging in preventing the penetration of small&#8208;molecule acceptors into the polymer donor layer via erosion or swelling. Herein, solid additives (SAs) with varied electrostatic potential distributions and steric hinderance are introduced into SD&#8208;OSCs to investigate the effect of evaporation dynamics and selective interaction on vertical component distribution. Multiple modelings indicate that the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction dominates the interactions between aromatic SAs and active layer components. Among them, p&#8208;dibromobenzene shows a stronger interaction with the donor while 2&#8208;chloronaphthalene (2&#8208;CN) interacts more preferably with acceptor. Combining the depth&#8208;dependent morphological study aided by multiple X&#8208;ray scattering methods, it is concluded that the evaporation of SAs can drive the stronger&#8208;interaction component upward to the surface, while having minor impact on the overall molecular packing. Ultimately, the 2&#8208;CN&#8208;treated devices with reduced acceptor concentration at the bottom surface deliver a high power conversion efficiency of 19.2%, demonstrating the effectiveness of applying selective interactions to improve the vertical morphology of OSCs by using SAs with proper structure.

         <title>Top&#8208;Down Fabrication of Atomic Patterns in Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precision patterning of Cu atoms in twisted bilayer graphene using a top&#8208;down and bottom&#8208;up approach is presented. The process involves utilizing controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice with an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The e&#8208;beam defines attachment points for Cu atoms, and thermally induced migration of source atoms allows impurities and clusters to be attached with limited human interaction.








Abstract
Atomic&#8208;scale engineering typically involves bottom&#8208;up approaches, leveraging parameters such as temperature, partial pressures, and chemical affinity to promote spontaneous arrangement of atoms. These parameters are applied globally, resulting in atomic&#8208;scale features scattered probabilistically throughout the material. In a top&#8208;down approach, different regions of the material are exposed to different parameters, resulting in structural changes varying on the scale of the resolution. In this work, the application of global and local parameters is combined in an aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) to demonstrate atomic&#8208;scale precision patterning of atoms in twisted bilayer graphene. The focused electron beam is used to define attachment points for foreign atoms through the controlled ejection of carbon atoms from the graphene lattice. The sample environment is staged with nearby source materials such that the sample temperature can induce migration of the source atoms across the sample surface. Under these conditions, the electron&#8208;beam (top&#8208;down) enables carbon atoms in the graphene to be replaced spontaneously by diffusing adatoms (bottom&#8208;up). Using image&#8208;based feedback control, arbitrary patterns of atoms and atom clusters are attached to the twisted bilayer graphene with limited human interaction. The role of substrate temperature on adatom and vacancy diffusion is explored by first&#8208;principles simulations.

         <title>In Situ Anchoring Ultrafine ZnS Nanodots on 2D MXene Nanosheets for Accelerating Polysulfide Redox and Regulating Li Plating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ultrafine ZnS nanodots grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal method with abundant active site can not only act as a redox accelerator to promote the bidirectional conversion of lithium polysulfides and mitigate the shutting effect, but also as a regulator for enabling uniform Li plating/stripping to inhibit the growth of Li dendrite.








Abstract
Lithium&#8722;sulfur (Li&#8722;S) battery is a promising energy storage system due to its cost effectiveness and high energy density. However, formation of Li dendrites from Li metal anode and shuttle effect of lithium polysulfides (LiPSs) from S cathode impede its practical application. Herein, ultrafine ZnS nanodots are uniformly grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by a low&#8208;temperature (60 &#176;C) hydrothermal method for the first time. Distinctively, the ZnS nanodot&#8208;decorated MXene nanosheets (ZnS/MXene) can be easily filtered to be a flexible and freestanding film in several minutes. The ZnS/MXene film can be used as a current collector for Li&#8208;metal anode to promote uniform Li deposition due to the superior lithiophilicity of ZnS nanodots. ZnS/MXene powders obtained by freeze drying can be used as separator decorator to address the shuttle effect of LiPSs due to their excellent adsorbability. Theoretical calculation proves that the existence of ZnS nanodots on MXene can obviously improve the adsorption ability of ZnS/MXene with Li+ and LiPSs. Li&#8722;S full cells with composite Li&#8208;metal anode and modified separator exhibit remarkable rate and cycling performance. Other transition metal sulfides (CdS, CuS, etc.) can be also grown on 2D MXene nanosheets by the low&#8208;temperature hydrothermal strategy.

Plasmonic Nanoantennas
In article number 2301787, Dongxiao Li, Hong Zhou, Chengkuo Lee, Xiaojing Mu, and co&#8208;workers propose a design strategy for single&#8208;pixel modulation&#8208;free plasmonic nanoantennas based on loss engineering. This strategy allows a single device to enhance and capture full and complex fingerprint vibrations in the mid&#8208;infrared range. With the aid of machine learning, the device successfully detects and distinguishes the absorption fingerprints of various molecules.

Water Splitting
In article number 2300505, Cailei Yuan and co&#8208;workers report an ingenious approach to assemble Ni and Fe dual atoms into the interlayer of MoS2. The interlayer&#8208;confined structure provides a microenvironment highly boosting the catalytic process, and meanwhile a protective &#8220;shelter&#8221; for active metal atoms away from acid corrosion, agglomeration, and detachment. The interlayer&#8208;confined strategy provides a new direction for single&#8208;atom catalysts development in the future.

Graphene
In article number 2302906 by Ondrej Dyck and co&#8208;workers, automated atomic patterning of twisted bilayer graphene is demonstrated using a scanning transmission electron microscope. Top&#8208;down electron beam irradiation is used to define attachment points in the graphene. A bottom&#8208;up, thermally controlled, atomization and diffusion process is used to supply Cu atoms, which spontaneously bond to the attachment points. This strategy holds promise for atomic precision manufacturing.

Tissue Regeneration
Inspired by the regulation of cellular circadian clock on tissue regeneration, in article number 2301037, Huitong Ruan, Wenguo Cui, Lianfu Deng, and co&#8208;workers report circadian&#8208;clock&#8208;regulating biomaterials that are fabricated using the air&#8208;microfluidic technique. The chemical cross&#8208;linking between poly(vinyl alcohol) and modified phenylboronic acid can effectively activate the intrinsic circadian clock of nucleus pulposus cells via the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, thus improving the regeneration of intervertebral discs.

         <title>Emerging Trends in Soft Electronics: Integrating Machine Intelligence with Soft Acoustic/Vibration Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft acoustic/vibration sensors have gained tremendous interest recently due to their unique ability to detect broadband stimuli. When used synergistically with machine learning (ML), they play an important role in driving the development of numerous Internet of Things applications. This review offers an overview of recent progress in the development of soft acoustic/vibration sensors and their signal processing using ML.








Abstract
In the last decade, soft acoustic/vibration sensors have gained tremendous research interest due to their unique ability to detect broadband acoustic/vibration stimuli, potentializing futuristic applications including voice biometrics, voice&#8208;controlled human&#8211;machine&#8208;interfaces, electronic skin, and skin&#8208;mountable healthcare devices. Importantly, to benefit most from these sensors, it is inevitable to use machine learning (ML) to process their output signals; with ML, a more accurate and efficient interpretation of original data is possible. This paper is dedicated to offering an overview of recent advances empowering the development of soft acoustic/vibration sensors and their signal processing using ML. First, the key performance parameters of the sensors are discussed. Second, popular transduction mechanisms for the sensors are addressed, followed by an in&#8208;depth overview of each type, covering materials used, structural designs, and sensing performances. Third, potential applications of the sensors are elaborated and fourth, a thorough discussion on ML is conducted, exploring different types of ML, specific ML algorithms suitable for processing acoustic/vibration signals, and current trends in ML&#8208;assisted applications. Finally, the challenges and potential opportunities in soft acoustic/vibration sensor and ML research are revealed to offer new insights into future prospects in these fields.

         <title>Flexible Quantum Dot Light&#8208;Emitting Device for Emerging Multifunctional and Smart Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper presents a comprehensive review of flexible electroluminescent quantum dot light emitting technologies including quantum dot materials, working mechanisms, flexible/stretchable strategies and patterning strategies, and the highlights of emerging multifunctional integrations and intelligent applications. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible quantum dot light emitting devices and their intriguing future application scenario.








Abstract
Quantum dot light&#8208;emitting diodes (QLEDs), owing to their exceptional performances in device efficiency, color purity/tunability in the visible region and solution&#8208;processing ability on various substrates, become a potential candidate for flexible and ultrathin electroluminescent (EL) lighting and display. Moreover, beyond the lighting and display, flexible QLEDs are enabled with endless possibilities in the era of the internet of things and artificial intelligence by acting as input/output ports in wearable integrated systems. Challenges remain in the development of flexible QLEDs with the goals for high performance, excellent flexibility/even stretchability, and emerging applications. In this paper, the recent developments of QLEDs including quantum dot materials, working mechanism, flexible/stretchable strategies and patterning strategies, and highlight its emerging multifunctional integrations and smart applications covering wearable optical medical devices, pressure&#8208;sensing EL devices, and neural smart EL devices, are reviewed. The remaining challenges are also summarized and an outlook on the future development of flexible QLEDs made. The review is expected to offer a systematic understanding and valuable inspiration for flexible QLEDs to simultaneously satisfy optoelectronic and flexible properties for emerging applications.

         <title>Recent Progress for Concurrent Realization of Shuttle&#8208;Inhibition and Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
To settle the shuttle effect and Li&#8208;dendrite growth issues of lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries simultaneously, the &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; host materials toward Li&#8211;S full cell, &#8220;two&#8208;birds&#8208;with&#8208;one&#8208;stone&#8221; modified separators, and tailored electrolyte additives for stabilizing sulfur/lithium electrodes are regarded as efficient strategies. Herein, a systematic and comprehensive review of recent studies, perspectives, and challenges confronted with Li&#8211;S batteries is presented.








Abstract
Lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries have become one of the most promising new&#8208;generation energy storage systems owing to their ultrahigh energy density (2600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1), cost&#8208;effectiveness, and environmental friendliness. Nevertheless, their practical applications are seriously impeded by the shuttle effect of soluble lithium polysulfides (LiPSs), and the uncontrolled dendrite growth of metallic Li, which result in rapid capacity fading and battery safety problems. A systematic and comprehensive review of the cooperative combination effect and tackling the fundamental problems in terms of cathode and anode synchronously is still lacking. Herein, for the first time, the strategies for inhibiting shuttle behavior and dendrite&#8208;free Li&#8211;S batteries simultaneously are summarized and classified into three parts, including &#8220;two&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; S&#8208;cathode and Li&#8208;anode host materials toward Li&#8211;S full cell, &#8220;two birds with one stone&#8221; modified functional separators, and tailoring electrolyte for stabilizing sulfur and lithium electrodes. This review also emphasizes the fundamental Li&#8211;S chemistry mechanism and catalyst principles for improving electrochemical performance; advanced characterization technologies to monitor real&#8208;time LiPS evolution are also discussed in detail. The problems, perspectives, and challenges with respect to inhibiting the shuttle effect and dendrite growth issues as well as the practical application of Li&#8211;S batteries are also proposed.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 32, August 10, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nowadays, there is an imperative need for more efficient interaction and communication between electronics and biology. This review article represents an extensive overview of contemporary memristive technologies for biointerfacing.








Abstract
Memristive technologies promise to have a large impact on modern electronics, particularly in the areas of reconfigurable computing and artificial intelligence (AI) hardware. Meanwhile, the evolution of memristive materials alongside the technological progress is opening application perspectives also in the biomedical field, particularly for implantable and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip devices where advanced sensing technologies generate a large amount of data. Memristive devices are emerging as bioelectronic links merging biosensing with computation, acting as physical processors of analog signals or in the framework of advanced digital computing architectures. Recent developments in the processing of electrical neural signals, as well as on transduction and processing of chemical biomarkers of neural and endocrine functions, are reviewed. It is concluded with a critical perspective on the future applicability of memristive devices as pivotal building blocks in bio&#8208;AI fusion concepts and bionic schemes.

Abstract
Amorphous transition metal oxides have attracted significant attention in energy storage devices owing to their potentially desirable electrochemical properties caused by abundant unsaturated dangling bonds. However, the amorphization further amplifies the shortcoming of the poor intrinsic electronic conductivity of the metal oxides, resulting in unsatisfying rate capability and power density. Herein, freestanding amorphous Ca&#8208;doped V2O5 (a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5) cathodes are successfully prepared via in&#8208;situ electrochemical oxidation of Ca&#8208;doped VO2 nanoarrays for wearable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries. The doping of Ca and construction of freestanding structure effectively uncover the potential of amorphous V2O5, which can make full use of the abundant active sites for high volumetric capacity and simultaneously achieve fast reaction kinetics for excellent rate performance. More importantly, the introduction of Ca can notably reduce the formation energy of VO2 according to theoretical calculation results and realizes amorphous to crystalline reversible conversion chemistry in the charge/discharge procedure, thereby facilitating the reversible capacity of the newly developed a&#8208;Ca&#8208;V2O5. This work provides an innovative design strategy to construct high&#8208;rate capacity amorphous metal oxides as freestanding electrodes for low&#8208;cost and high&#8208;safe wearable energy&#8208;storage technology.

         <title>Simultaneous Control of Spectral And Directional Emissivity with Gradient Epsilon&#8208;Near&#8208;Zero InAs Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermally generated light is ubiquitous and its control is critical to a broad range of energy and sensing technologies. Semiconductor photonic films with tailored spatial doping gradients are demonstrated to deliver simultaneous control of both directional and spectral aspects of their thermal emission due to the spatial gradient in the epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero frequency they support.








Abstract
Controlling both the spectral bandwidth and directionality of emitted thermal radiation is a fundamental challenge in contemporary photonics. Recent work has shown that materials with a spatial gradient in the frequency range of their epsilon&#8208;near&#8208;zero (ENZ) response can support broad spectrum directionality in their emissivity, enabling high total radiance to specific angles of incidence. However, this capability is limited spectrally and directionally by the availability of materials with phonon&#8208;polariton resonances over long&#8208;wave infrared wavelengths. Here, an approach is designed and experimentally demonstrated using doped III&#8211;V semiconductors that can simultaneously tailor spectral peak, bandwidth, and directionality of infrared emissivity. InAs&#8208;based gradient ENZ photonic structures that exhibit broadband directional emission with varying spectral bandwidths and directional ranges as a function of their doping concentration profile and thickness are epitaxially grown and characterized. Due to its easy&#8208;to&#8208;fabricate geometry, it is believed that this approach provides a versatile photonic platform to dynamically control broadband spectral and directional emissivity for a range of emerging applications in heat transfer and infrared sensing.

         <title>Conventional Non&#8208;Fluorescent Polymers: Unconventional Security Inks for Data Storage and Multidimensional Photonic Cryptography</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly secure photonic cryptography based on the non&#8208;fluorescent polymer inks, rather than conventional fluorescent/phosphorescent inks, is developed. The stored data in the polymer inks can only be lit up&#160;by a anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophore, with their emission wavelength, intensity, and chirality prescribed by the polymer structures. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a much higher security level.








Abstract
Traditional security inks relying on fluorescent/phosphorescent molecules are facing increasing risks of forgery or tampering due to their simple readout scheme (i.e., UV&#8208;light irradiation) and the advancement of counterfeiting technologies. In this work, a multidimensional data&#8208;encryption method based on non&#8208;fluorescent polymers via a &#8220;lock&#8211;key&#8221; mechanism is developed. The non&#8208;fluorescent invisible polymer inks serve as the &#8220;lock&#8221; for data&#8208;encryption, while the anti&#8208;rigidochromic fluorophores that can distinctively light up the polymer inks with programed emissions are &#8220;keys&#8221; for decryption. The emission of decrypted data is prescribed by polymer chemical structure, molecular weight, topology, copolymer sequence, and phase structure, and shows distinct intensity, wavelength, and chirality compared with the intrinsic emission of fluorophores. Therefore, the data is triply encrypted and naturally gains a high&#8208;security level, e.g., only one out of 20&#160;000 keys can access the only correct readout from 40&#160;000&#160;000 possible outputs in a three&#8208;polymers&#8208;based data&#8208;encryption matrix. Note that fluorophores lacking anti&#8208;rigidochrimism cannot selectively light up the inks and fail in data&#8208;decryption. Further, the diverse topologies, less well&#8208;defined structures, and random&#8208;coiled shapes of polymers make it impossible for them to be imitated. This work offers a new design for security inks and boosts data security levels beyond the reach of conventional fluorescent inks.

         <title>Catechin&#8208;functionalized Cationic Lipopolymer Based Multicomponent Nanomicelles for Lung&#8208;Targeting Delivery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Catechins from green tea are one of the most effective natural compounds for cancer chemoprevention and have attracted extensive research. Cancer cell&#8208;selective apoptosis&#8208;inducing properties of catechins depend on efficient intracellular delivery. However, the low bioavailability limits the application of catechins. Herein, a nano&#8208;scaled micellar composite composed of catechin&#8208;functionalized cationic lipopolymer and serum albumin was constructed. Cationic liposomes tended to accumulate in the pulmonary microvasculature due to electrostatic effects and were able to deliver the micellar system intracellularly, thus improving the bioavailability of catechins. Albumin in the system acted as a biocompatible anti&#8208;plasma absorbent, forming complexes with positively charged lipopolymer (Pc) under electrostatic interactions, contributing to prolonged in vivo retention. The physicochemical properties of the nano&#8208;micellar complexes were characterized, and the antitumor properties of catechin&#8208;functionalized materials were confirmed by ROS, caspase&#8208;3, and cell apoptosis measurements. The role of each functional module, cationic polymeric liposome and albumin, was revealed by cell penetration, in vivo animal assays, etc. This multicomponent micellar nanocomposite has the potential to become an effective vehicle for the treatment of lung diseases such as pneumonia, lung tumors, sepsis&#8208;induced lung injury, etc. This study also demonstrated that it is a great strategy to create a delivery system that is both tissue&#8208;targeted and biologically active by combing cationic liposomes with the native bioactive compound catechins.

         <title>Advancing In Situ Food Monitoring through a Smart Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package System Demonstrated by the Detection of Salmonella in Whole Chicken</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221;, a novel food packaging platform, consisting of a redesigned tray for sample localization, a membrane for reagent immobilization, and a Salmonella&#8208;specific sensor, is reported. Performance is substantiated with ready&#8208;to&#8208;eat chicken products, including ones that are contaminated using knives, gloves, and surfaces. Real&#8208;world use is also simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.








Abstract
With food production shifting away from traditional farm&#8208;to&#8208;table approaches to efficient multistep supply chains, the incidence of food contamination has increased. Consequently, pathogen testing via inefficient culture&#8208;based methods has increased, despite its lack of real&#8208;time capabilities and need for centralized facilities. While in situ pathogen detection would address these limitations and enable individual product monitoring, accurate detection within unprocessed, packaged food products without user manipulation has proven elusive. Herein, &#8220;Lab&#8208;in&#8208;a&#8208;Package&#8221; is presented, a platform capable of sampling, concentrating, and detecting target pathogens within closed food packaging, without intervention. This system consists of a newly designed packaging tray and reagent&#8208;infused membrane that can be paired universally with diverse pathogen sensors. The inclined food packaging tray maximizes fluid localization onto the sensing interface, while the membrane acts as a reagent&#8208;immobilizing matrix and an antifouling barrier for the sensor. The platform is substantiated using a newly discovered Salmonella&#8208;responsive nucleic acid probe, which enables hands&#8208;free detection of 103 colony forming units (CFU) g&#8722;1 target pathogen in a packaged whole chicken. The platform remains effective when contamination is introduced with toolsand surfaces, ensuring widespread efficacy. Its real&#8208;world use for in situ detection is simulated using a handheld fluorescence scanner with smartphone connectivity.

         <title>Hot&#8208;Exciton Mechanism and AIE Effect Boost the Performance of Deep&#8208;Red Emitters in Non&#8208;Doped OLEDs</title>

         <dc:description>
A versatile strategy achieves hot exciton fluorescence with aggregation&#8208;induced emission properties via elevation of the first singlet excited state by modulating the conjugation length of the acceptor unit to match the energy of high&#8208;lying triplet states. The proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD affords deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped organic light&#8208;emitting diode at 685 nm with an external quantum efficiency of 12.2%.








Abstract
Luminescent materials possessing a &#8220;hot&#8208;exciton&#8221; mechanism and aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE) qualities are well&#8208;suited for use as emitting materials in nondoped organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs), particularly in deep&#8208;red regions where their ground state and singlet excited state surfaces are in proximity, leading to the formation of multiple nonradiative channels. However, designing molecules that artificially combine the hot&#8208;exciton mechanism and AIE attributes remains a formidable task. In this study, a versatile strategy is presented to achieve hot&#8208;exciton fluorescence with AIE property by increasing the first singlet excited (S1) state through modulation of the conjugation length of the newly created acceptor unit, matching the energy level of high&#8208;lying triplet (Tn) states, and enhancing exciton utilization efficiency by employing suitable donor moieties. This approach reduces the aggregation&#8208;caused quenching (ACQ) in the aggregate state, resulting in the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept emitter DT&#8208;IPD, which produces an unprecedented external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 12.2% and Commission Internationale de I'Eclairage&#160;(CIE)&#160;coordinates of (0.69, 0.30) in a deep&#8208;red non&#8208;doped OLED at 685&#160;nm, representing the highest performance among all deep&#8208;red OLEDs based on materials with hot&#8208;exciton mechanisms. This work provides novel insights into the design of more efficient hot&#8208;exciton emitters with AIE properties.

         <title>Mechanoluminescence and Photoluminescence Heterojunction for Superior Multimode Sensing Platform of Friction, Force, Pressure, and Temperature in Fibers and 3D&#8208;Printed Polymers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The development of a multifunctional sensing platform in the form of photo&#8208;/mechano&#8208;luminescent powder, fibers, and 3D&#8208;printed polymers for optical detection of pressure, temperature, force, and friction is reported. The combination of 3D&#8208;printing with fiber spinning demonstrates the possibility of mass production of mechanoluminescence&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.








Abstract
Endowing a single material with various types of luminescence, that is, exhibiting a simultaneous optical response to different stimuli, is vital in various fields. A photoluminescence (PL)&#8208; and mechanoluminescence (ML)&#8208;based multifunctional sensing platform is built by combining heterojunctioned ZnS/CaZnOS:Mn2+ mechano&#8208;photonic materials using a 3D&#8208;printing technique and fiber spinning. ML&#8208;active particles are embedded in micrometer&#8208;sized cellulose fibers for flexible optical devices capable of emitting light driven by mechanical force. Individually modified 3D&#8208;printed hard units that exhibit intense ML in response to mechanical deformation, such as impact and friction, are also fabricated. Importantly, they also allow low&#8208;pressure sensing up to &#8776;100&#160;bar, a range previously inaccessible by any other optical sensing technique. Moreover, the developed optical manometer based on the PL of the materials demonstrates a superior high&#8208;pressure sensitivity of &#8776;6.20&#160;nm&#160;GPa&#8722;1. Using this sensing platform, four modes of temperature detection can be achieved: excitation&#8208;band spectral shifts, emission&#8208;band spectral shifts, bandwidth broadening, and lifetime shortening. This work supports the possibility of mass production of ML&#8208;active mechanical and optoelectronic parts integrated with scientific and industrial tools and apparatus.

         <title>Adipose Mesenchymal Stem Cell Derived Exosomes Promote Keratinocytes and Fibroblasts Embedded in Collagen/Platelet&#8208;Rich Plasma Scaffold and Accelerate Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The preparation and application of an exosome/cell&#8208;loaded COL/PRP scaffold for wound healing are assessed. The scaffold is applied on the dorsum wound of the mouse, wherein it promotes wound healing by reducing the level of inflammation, triggering proliferation of cells embedded in the scaffold, and promoting angiogenesis.








Abstract
Engineered skin substitutes derived from human skin significantly reduce inflammatory reactions mediated by foreign/artificial materials and are consequently easier to use for clinical application. Type I collagen is a main component of the extracellular matrix during wound healing and has excellent biocompatibility, and platelet&#8208;rich plasma can be used as the initiator of the healing cascade. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are crucial for tissue repair and play key roles in enhancing cell regeneration, promoting angiogenesis, regulating inflammation, and remodeling extracellular matrix. Herein, Type I collagen and platelet&#8208;rich plasma, which provide natural supports for keratinocyte and fibroblast adhesion, migration, and proliferation, are mixed to form a stable 3D scaffold. Adipose mesenchymal stem cell derived exosomes are added to the scaffold to improve the performance of the engineered skin. The physicochemical properties of this cellular scaffold are analyzed, and the repair effect is evaluated in a full&#8208;thickness skin defect mouse model. The cellular scaffold reduces the level of inflammation and promotes cell proliferation and angiogenesis to accelerate wound healing. Proteomic analysis shows that exosomes exhibit excellent anti&#8208;inflammatory and proangiogenic effects in collagen/platelet&#8208;rich plasma scaffolds. The proposed method provides a new therapeutic strategy and theoretical basis for tissue regeneration and wound repair.

         <title>Achieving A Record Scintillation Performance by Micro&#8208;Doping Heterovalent Magnetic Ion in Cs3Cu2I5 Single&#8208;Crystal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Ultra&#8208;bright, ultra&#8208;fast, and low&#8208;cost ideal scintillator has been critically absent and sorely desired in scintillation detection and has hitherto not been found. Here, we report a high&#8208;quality bulk Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal scintillator with ultra&#8208;high light yield (&#8764;95,772 photons/MeV, 137Cs &#947;&#8208;ray), excellent energy resolution (3.79%, 662&#160;KeV), and ultra&#8208;fast scintillation decay time (3&#160;ns, 81.5%). In mechanism, we find that the micro&#8208;doping of heterovalent magnetic ions (at the ppm level) can effectively modulate the luminescence kinetics of self&#8208;capture excitons in the scintillator. Compared with previous reports, the introduction of trace amounts of magnetic Mn2+ (&#8764;18.6&#160;ppm) in Cs3Cu2I5 single&#8208;crystal shortens the scintillation decay time by several hundred times, transforming slow decay into ultra&#8208;fast decay. Simultaneously, the light yield is also increased about three times to the highest value so far. From the comprehensive performance of the micro&#8208;doped Cs3Cu2I5:Mn single&#8208;crystal, these excellent scintillation properties, physical characteristics suitable for practical applications, and low&#8208;cost advantages render this single&#8208;crystal an ideal scintillator with great potential for commercialization.

         <title>Hot&#8208;casting Strategy Empowers High&#8208;Boiling Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cells with Over 18.5% Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>

Abstract
Most top&#8208;rank organic solar cells (OSCs) are manufactured by the halogenated solvent chloroform, which possesses a narrow processing window due to its low&#8208;boiling point. Herein, based on two high&#8208;boiling solvents, halogenated solvent chlorobenzene (CB) and non&#8208;halogenated green solvent ortho&#8208;xylene (OX), preparing active layers with the hot solution was put forward to enhance the performance of the OSCs. In situ test and morphological characterization clarify that the hot&#8208;casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly of both donor and acceptor in the active layer, contributing to preferable donor/acceptor ratio, vertical phase separation, and molecular stacking, which is beneficial to charge generation and extraction. Based on the PM6:BO&#8208;4Cl, the hot&#8208;casting OSCs with a wide processing window achieve PCEs of 18.03% in CB and 18.12% in OX, which are much higher than the devices processed with room temperature solution. Moreover, the hot&#8208;casting devices with PM6:BTP&#8208;eC9 deliver remarkable FF of 80.31% and PCE of 18.52% in OX, representing the record value among binary devices with green solvent. This work demonstrates a facile strategy to manipulate the molecular distribution and arrangement for boosting the efficiency of OSCs with high&#8208;boiling solvents.

In situ test and morphological characterization clarify that the hot-casting strategy assists in the fast and synchronous molecular assembly of both donor and acceptor in the active layer, contributing to preferable donor/acceptor ratio, vertical phase separation, and molecular stacking, which is beneficial to charge generation and extraction. Based on the PM6:BO-4Cl, the hot-casting OSCs with a wide processing window achieve PCEs of 18.03% in CB and 18.12% in OX, which are much higher than the devices processed with room temperature solution.

         <title>A Layered Bi2Te3@PPy Cathode for Aqueous Zinc Ion Batteries: Mechanism and Application in Printed Flexible Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Low&#8208;cost, safe, and environmental&#8208;friendly rechargeable aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) are promising as next&#8208;generation energy storage devices for wearable electronics among other applications. However, sluggish ionic transport kinetics and the unstable electrode structure during ionic insertion/extraction hampers their deployment. Herein, &#160;we propose a new cathode material based on a layered metal chalcogenide (LMC), bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), coated with polypyrrole (PPy). Taking advantage of the PPy coating, the Bi2Te3@PPy composite presents strong ionic absorption affinity, high oxidation resistance, and high structural stability. The ZIBs based on Bi2Te3@PPy cathodes exhibit high capacities and ultra&#8208;long lifespans of over 5000 cycles. They also present outstanding stability even under bending. In addition, &#160;we analyze here the reaction mechanism using in situ X&#8208;ray diffraction, X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and computational tools and demonstrate that, in the aqueous system, Zn2+ is not inserted into the cathode as previously assumed. In contrast, proton charge storage dominates the process. Overall, this work not only shows the great potential of LMCs as ZIBs cathode materials and the advantages of PPy coating, but also clarifies the charge/discharge mechanism in rechargeable ZIBs based on LMCs.

         <title>Molecularly imprinting technology enables proactive capture of nitrogen for boosted ammonia synthesis under ambient conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Electrochemical nitrogen reduction reaction (NRR) is a burgeoning field for green and sustainable ammonia production, in which numerous potential catalysts emerge in endless. However, satisfactory performances are still not realized under practical applications due to the limited solubility and sluggish diffusion of nitrogen at the interface. Herein, molecularly imprinting technology is adopted to construct an adlayer with abundant nitrogen imprints on the electrocatalyst, which is capable to selectively recognize and proactively aggregate high&#8208;concentrated nitrogen at the interface while hindering the access of overwhelming water simultaneously. With this favourable microenvironment, nitrogen could preferentially occupy the active surface, and the NRR equilibrium could be positively shifted to facilitate the reaction kinetics. Approximately threefold improvements in both ammonia production rate (185.7&#160;&#181;g h&#8722;1 mg&#8722;1) and Faradaic efficiency (72.9%) are achieved by a metal&#8208;free catalyst compared with the bare one. We believe that the molecularly imprinting strategy should be a general method to find further applicability in numerous catalysts or even other reactions facing similar challenges.

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Chemoselective Hydrogenation of Nitroarene Over Atomic Metal&#8208;Nonmetal Catalytic Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Constructing atomic catalytic pair emerges as an attractive strategy to achieve better catalytic performance. Herein, we report an atomic Ir1&#8208;P1/NPG catalyst with asymmetric Ir&#8208;N2P1 sites that delivers superb activity and selectivity for hydrogenation of various functionalized nitrostyrene. In the hydrogenation reaction of 3&#8208;nitrostyrene, Ir1&#8208;P1/NPG (NPG refers to N,P&#8208;codoped graphene) shows a turnover frequency (TOF) of 1197 h&#8722;1, while the reaction cannot occur over Ir1/NG (NG refers to N&#8208;doped graphene). Compared to Ir1/NG, the charge density of Ir site in Ir1&#8208;P1/NPG is greatly elevated, which is conducive to H2 dissociation. Moreover, revealed by density functional theory (DFT) calculations and poisoning experiments, the P site in Ir1&#8208;P1/NPG is found able to bind nitrostyrene, while the neighboring Ir site provides H to reduce the nitro group in chemoselective hydrogenation of nitrostyrene. This work offers a successful example of establishing atomic catalytic pair for driving important chemical reactions, paving the way for the development of more advanced catalysts to further improve the catalytic performance.

         <title>The Construction of Binary Phase Electrolyte Interface for Highly Stable Zinc Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Metal zinc is a promising anode candidate of aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries due to high theoretical capacity, low cost and high safety. However, it often suffers from hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Zn dendrite growth and formation of by&#8208;products. Herein, a triethyl phosphate (TEP)/H2O binary phase electrolyte (BPE) interface&#160;was developed by introducing TEP&#8208;based electrolyte&#8208;wetted hydrophobic polypropylene (PP) separator onto the Zn anode surface. The equilibrium of BPE interface depends on the comparable surface tension of H2O&#8208;based and TEP&#8208;based electrolytes on hydrophobic PP separator surfaces. The BPE interface will induce Zn2+ solvation structure conversion from [Zn(H2O)x]2+ to [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, where most solvated H2O molecules are removed. In [Zn(TEP)n(H2O)y]2+, the residual H2O molecules can be further constrained by the formation of H&#8208;bonds between TEP and H2O molecules. Consequently, the ionization of solvated H2O molecules is effectively suppressed, and the HER and by&#8208;products will be effectively restricted on Zn anode surfaces in BPE. As a result, Zn anodes exhibit a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.12% and superior cycling performance of 6000&#160;h, which is much higher than the case in single&#8208;phase aqueous electrolytes. To illustrate the feasibility of BPE in full cells, the Zn/AlxV2O5 batteries&#160;were assembled based on the BPE and exhibited enhanced cycling performance.

         <title>Coordination Chemistry as a Universal Strategy for a Controlled Perovskite Crystallization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
As a green solvent, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) is widely used in the processing of perovskite to control its morphology and orientation. Unfortunately, the highly coordinating DMSO is not easily expelled from the thin films, which negatively affects the long&#8208;term stability of resulting perovskite solar cells. In this work, dimethyl sulfide is introduced to facilitate perovskite formation by expelling the DMSO from the DMSO&#8208;intermediate phase compositions.








Abstract
The most efficient and stable perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are made from a complex mixture of precursors. Typically, to then form a thin film, an extreme oversaturation of the perovskite precursor is initiated to trigger nucleation sites, e.g., by vacuum, an airstream, or a so&#8208;called antisolvent. Unfortunately, most oversaturation triggers do not expel the lingering (and highly coordinating) dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), which is used as a precursor solvent, from the thin films; this detrimentally affects long&#8208;term stability. In this work, (the green) dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is introduced as a novel nucleation trigger for perovskite films combining, uniquely, high coordination and high vapor pressure. This gives DMS a universal scope: DMS replaces other solvents by coordinating more strongly and removes itself once the film formation is finished. To demonstrate this novel coordination chemistry approach, MAPbI3 PSCs are processed, typically dissolved in hard&#8208;to&#8208;remove (and green) DMSO achieving 21.6% efficiency, among the highest reported efficiencies for this system. To confirm the universality of the strategy, DMS is tested for FAPbI3 as another composition, which shows higher efficiency of 23.5% compared to 20.9% for a device fabricated with chlorobenzene. This work provides a universal strategy to control perovskite crystallization using coordination chemistry, heralding the revival of perovskite compositions with pure DMSO.

         <title>Interfacial &#8220;Single&#8208;Atom&#8208;in&#8208;Defects&#8221; Catalysts Accelerating Li+ Desolvation Kinetics for Long&#8208;Lifespan Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>

         <dc:description>
The desolvation of Li+&#8208;solvents complex and Li0 diffusion kinetics are investigated experimentally and theoretically by applying atomic iron&#8208;in&#8208;defects (SAC&#8208;in&#8208;Defects) as the catalytic kinetics promotor, significantly reducing the related energy barriers of desolvation and diffusion. Consequently, the half and full cells stabilize long lifespans with high utilizations.








Abstract
The lithium&#8208;metal anode is a promising candidate for realizing high&#8208;energy&#8208;density batteries owing to its high capacity and low potential. However, several rate&#8208;limiting kinetic obstacles, such as the desolvation of Li+ solvation structure to liberate Li+, Li0 nucleation, and atom diffusion, cause heterogeneous spatial Li&#8208;ion distribution and fractal plating morphology with dendrite formation, leading to low Coulombic efficiency and depressive electrochemical stability. Herein, differing from pore sieving effect or electrolyte engineering, atomic iron anchors to cation vacancy&#8208;rich Co1&#8722;xS embedded in 3D porous carbon (SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC) is&#160;proposed and demonstrated as catalytic kinetic promoters. Numerous free Li ions are electrocatalytically dissociated from the Li+ solvation complex structure for uniform lateral diffusion by reducing desolvation and diffusion barriers via SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC, realizing smooth dendrite&#8208;free Li morphologies, as comprehensively understood by combined in&#160;situ/ex&#160;situ characterizations. Encouraged by SAFe/CVRCS@3DPC catalytic promotor, the modified Li&#8208;metal anodes achieve smooth plating with a long lifespan (1600&#160;h) and high Coulombic efficiency without any dendrite formation. Paired with the LiFePO4 cathode, the full cell (10.7&#160;mg&#160;cm&#8722;2) stabilizes a capacity retention of 90.3% after 300 cycles at 0.5&#160;C, signifying the feasibility of using interfacial catalysts for modulating Li behaviors toward practical applications.

         <title>Integrated Construction of a Long&#8208;Life Stretchable Zinc&#8208;Ion Capacitor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector with &#8220;geometric&#8208;intrinsic&#8221; dual stretchability is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and a stretchable zinc negative electrode with triple&#8208;layer coaxial heterostructure is further prepared through in situ confined electroplating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability.








Abstract
The major challenge in achieving high&#8208;performance stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices is the combination of stretchable dendrite&#8208;free zinc negative electrodes and sufficient bonding between components (current collector, electrode, separator, and package). Herein, based on a series of physicochemically tunable self&#8208;healing polyurethanes, an elastic current collector is prepared through a swelling&#8208;induced wrinkling method, and then a stretchable zinc negative electrode prepared through in situ confined electroplating. The elastic current collector has a nano&#8208;network structure with polyurethane encapsulation, and exhibits both geometric and intrinsic stretchability. The stretchable zinc negative electrode formed in situ has high electrochemical activity and exhibits an excellent cycle life under the protection of a Zn2+&#8208;permeable coating. Furthermore, fully polyurethane&#8208;based stretchable zinc&#8208;ion capacitors are assembled through in situ electrospinning and hot&#8208;pressing techniques. Due to the high stretchability of the components and the interfusion of the matrixes, the integrated device exhibits excellent deformability and desirable electrochemical stability. This work provides a systematic construction plan for stretchable zinc&#8208;ion energy&#8208;storage devices in three aspects: material synthesis, component preparation, and device assembly.

         <title>Direct Observation of Atomic Step&#8208;Assisted Stabilization of&#160;Polar Surfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy combined with first&#8208;principles calculations discovers a hitherto unknown stabilization mechanism of polar oxide surfaces. The dynamic motion of atomic steps activated at a high temperature converts the LaAlO3 (001) polar surface to a nonpolar (015) vicinal surface via step reconstruction involving cation vacancy formation, which completely cancels the electric fields along all radial directions.








Abstract
Polar surfaces are intrinsically unstable and thus highly reactive due to the uncompensated surface charges. The charge compensation is accompanied by various surface reconstructions, establishing novel functionality for their applications. The present&#160;in situ atomic&#8208;scale electron microscopy study directly shows that the atomic step and step&#8208;assisted reconstruction play central roles in the charge compensation of polar oxide surfaces. The&#160;flat (LaO)+&#8208;terminated LaAlO3 (001) polar surface, when annealed at high temperature in vacuum, transits to the (015) vicinal surface via the dynamic motion and interaction of atomic steps. While the (015) vicinal surface possesses zero polarization along the surface normal, a thermodynamic ground state is achieved when the in&#8208;plane polarization is fully compensated via the reconstruction of step&#8208;edge atoms; the step&#8208;edge La atoms are displaced from their ordinary atomic sites toward the adjacent Al step&#8208;edge sites, resulting in the formation of negatively charged La vacancies at the corresponding step edges. As confirmed by first&#8208;principles calculations, the observed step reconstruction of (015) vicinal surface can completely cancel both out&#8208;of&#8208;plane and in&#8208;plane electric fields. This hitherto unknown mechanism reveals the central role of step reconstruction in stabilizing a polar surface, providing valuable insights for understanding the novel charge compensation mechanism accompanied by the step reconstruction.

         <title>Unraveling Size&#8208;Dependent Ion&#8208;Migration for Stable Mixed&#8208;Halide Perovskite Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites without halide segregation is developed. Two factors contribute to this improvement: composition homogeneity is a prerequisite for realizing high thermodynamic stability, and further reduction of the grain size strengthens the ability to resist stimuli. Consequently, efficient and color&#8208;stable deep&#8208;blue CsPbBr1.5Cl1.5 and yellow CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs are presented, showing the potential for full&#8208;color&#8208;gamut displays and solid&#8208;state lighting.








Abstract
Mixed&#8208;halide perovskites show tunable emission wavelength across the visible&#8208;light range, with optimum control of the light color. However, color stability remains limited due to the notorious halide segregation under illumination or an electric field. Here, a versatile path toward high&#8208;quality mixed&#8208;halide perovskites with high emission properties and resistance to halide segregation is presented. Through systematic in and ex situ characterizations, key features for this advancement are proposed: a slowed and controllable crystallization process can promote achievement of halide homogeneity, which in turn ensures thermodynamic stability; meanwhile, downsizing perovskite nanoparticle to nanometer&#8208;scale dimensions can enhance their resistance to external stimuli, strengthening the phase stability. Leveraging this strategy, devices are developed based on CsPbCl1.5Br1.5 perovskite that achieves a champion external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 9.8% at 464&#160;nm, making it one of the most efficient deep&#8208;blue mixed&#8208;halide perovskite light&#8208;emitting diodes (PeLEDs) to date. Particularly, the device demonstrates excellent spectral stability, maintaining a constant emission profile and position for over 60 min of continuous operation. The versatility of this approach with CsPbBr1.5I1.5 PeLEDs is further showcased, achieving an impressive EQE of 12.7% at 576&#160;nm.

An ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy using dual passivating reagents of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride is demonstrated to realize all&#8208;interface passivation via one&#8208;step post&#8208;treatment, outperforming the traditional passivation with OAI. This strategy delivers a superior efficiency&#160;of 25.43% and an open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) of 1.202&#160;V, representing 94.05% of the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit VOC for the 1.55&#8208;eV perovskite absorber.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) have demonstrated over 25% power conversion efficiency (PCE) via efficient surface passivation. Unfortunately, state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art perovskite post&#8208;treatment strategies can solely heal the top interface defects. Herein, an ion&#8208;diffusion management strategy is proposed to concurrently modulate the top interfaces, buried interfaces, and bulk interfaces (i.e., grain boundaries) of perovskite film, enabling all&#8208;interface defect passivation. Specifically, this method is enabled by applying double interactive salts of octylammonium iodide (OAI) and guanidinium chloride (GACl) onto the 3D&#160;perovskite surface. It is revealed that the hydrogen&#8208;bonding interaction between OA+ and GA+ decelerates the OA+ diffusion and therefore forms a dimensionally broadened 2D capping layer. Additionally, the diffusion of GA+ and Cl&#8722; determines the composition of the bulk and buried interface of PSCs. As a result, n&#8211;inter&#8211;i&#8211;inter&#8211;p, i.e., five&#8208;layer structured PSCs can be obtained with a champion PCE of 25.43% (certified 24.4%). This approach also enables the substantially improved operational stability of perovskite solar cells.

         <title>Curbing Exosome Communications via Introducing Artificial Membrane Receptors for Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ac4ManNAz&#8208;DP nanoparticles first generate receptor&#8208;like azide groups on the membranes of pancreatic tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes by metabolic glycoengineering. DBCO&#8208;GEM/ISO&#8208;DP nanoparticles then can precisely bind to the azide&#8208;labeled tumor cells and tumor derived exosomes via bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, thus suppressing the primary tumors and the exosome communications between primary tumors and distal organs.








Abstract
Tumor&#8208;derived exosomes (TDEs) carry various biomolecular cargos and play crucial roles in metastasis. TDEs migrate to distal organs for intercellular communication and induce the formation of pre&#8208;metastatic niches (PMNs) to support tumor implantation and proliferation. Precise interference in the bioprocess of TDEs is expected to be efficacious for suppressing tumor metastasis. However, targeting both TDEs and the primary tumor is challenging. Here, based on metabolic glycoengineering and bio&#8208;orthogonal click chemistry, a two&#8208;step delivery strategy is designed to overcome this. During the first step, the tetraacetylated&#160;N&#8208;azidoacetyl&#8208;d&#8208;mannosamine&#8208;loaded nanoparticle responds to the metabolic activity of tumor cells in the primary tumor, tagging both tumor cells and TDEs with azide groups; dibenzyl&#8208;cyclootyne&#8208;modified nanoparticles then can, as the second step, specifically react with tumor cells and TDEs through a bio&#8208;orthogonal click reaction. This strategy not only inhibits tumor growth in pancreatic cancer models but also curbs the communicative role of TDEs in inducing liver PMNs and metastasis by tracking and downregulating the exosomal macrophage migration inhibitory factor.

         <title>Correlating the Valence State with the Adsorption Behavior of a Cu&#8208;Based Electrocatalyst for Furfural Oxidation with Anodic Hydrogen Production Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual&#8208;side H2 production device with ultralow energy input is built up, and the energy input is only 1/17 of water splitting. The deactivation mechanism of the anodic hydrogen production reaction is revealed as the changed adsorption ability of Cu&#8208;based catalysts. This study provides guidelines for the design of a stable Cu&#8208;based catalyst in anodic hydrogen production reactions.








Abstract
The low&#8208;potential furfural oxidation reaction (FFOR) on a Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst can produce H2 at the anode, thereby providing a bipolar H2 production system with an ultralow cell voltage. However, the intrinsic activity and stability of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the FFOR remain unsatisfactory for practical applications. This study investigates the correlation between the valence state and the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst in furfural oxidation. Cu0 is the adsorption site with low intrinsic activity. Cu+, which exists in the form of Cu(OH)ads in alkaline electrolytes, has no adsorption ability but can improve the performance of Cu0 by promoting the adsorption of FF. Moreover, a mixed&#8208;valence Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst (MV Cu) with high intrinsic activity and stability is prepared electrochemically. With the MV Cu catalyst, the assembled dual&#8208;side H2 production electrolyzer has a low electricity requirement of only 0.24&#160;kWh&#160;mH2&#8722;3 at an ultralow cell voltage of 0.3&#160;V, and it exhibits sufficient stability. This study not only correlates the valence state with the adsorption behavior of the Cu&#8208;based electrocatalyst for the low&#8208;potential FFOR with anodic H2 production but also reveals the mechanism of deactivation to provide design principles for Cu&#8208;based electrocatalysts with satisfactory stability.

         <title>Organic Polarized Light&#8208;Emitting Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), which integrate electroluminescence, current switching, and polarized emission into one device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization of 0.97. The high polarization characteristics of the OPLETs are assigned to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of molecular properties. High&#8208;contrast optical imaging and modern anti&#8208;counterfeit security based on OPLETs are demonstrated, establishing a new direction for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
Electrically driven polarized light&#8208;emitting sources are central to various applications including quantum computers, optical communication, and 3D displays, but serious challenges remain due to the inevitable incorporation of complex optical elements in conventional devices. Here, organic polarized light&#8208;emitting transistors (OPLETs), a kind of novel device that integrates the functions of organic field&#8208;effect transistors, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes, and polarizers into one unique device, are demonstrated with a degree of polarization (DOP) as high as 0.97, which is comparable to completely linearly polarized light (DOP = 1). Under the modulation of gate voltage, robust and efficient polarization emission is proven, ascribed to the intrinsic in&#8208;plane anisotropy of the molecular transition dipole moment in organic semiconductors and the open&#8208;ended feature of OPLETs instead of other factors. As a result, high&#8208;contrast optical imaging and anti&#8208;counterfeiting security are successfully demonstrated based on OPLETs, establishing a new direction for photonic and electronic integration toward on&#8208;chip miniaturized optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Breaking the Activity and Stability Bottlenecks of Electrocatalysts for Oxygen Evolution Reactions in Acids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
Oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a cornerstone reaction for a variety of electrochemical energy conversion and storage systems such as water splitting, CO2/N2 reduction, reversible fuel cells, and metal&#8208;air batteries. However, OER catalysis in acids suffers from extra sluggish kinetics due to the additional step of water dissociation along with its multiple electron transfer processes. Furthermore, OER catalysts often suffer from poor stability in harsh acidic electrolytes due to the severe dissolution/corrosion processes. The development of active and stable OER catalysts in acids is highly demanded. Here, &#160;we review the recent advances in OER electrocatalysis in acids and summarise the key strategies to overcome the bottlenecks of activity and stability for both noble&#8208;metal&#8208;based and noble metal&#8208;free catalysts, including i) morphology engineering, ii) composition engineering, and iii) defect engineering. Recent achievements in operando characterization and theoretical calculations are summarised which provide an unprecedented understanding of the OER mechanisms regarding active site identification, surface reconstruction, and degradation/dissolution pathways. Finally, &#160;we offer &#160;our views on the current challenges and opportunities to break the activity&#8208;stability relationships for acidic OER in mechanism understanding, catalyst design, as well as standardised stability and activity evaluation for industrial applications such as proton exchange membrane water electrolysers and beyond.

         <title>Push&#8208;pull Heptamethines Near The Cyanine Limit Exhibiting Large Quadratic Electro&#8208;Optic Effect</title>

Abstract
Harnessing the quadratic electro&#8208;optic (QEO) of near&#8208;infrared polymethine chromophores over broad telecom wavelength bands is a subject of immense potential but remains largely under&#8208;investigated. Herein&#160;we report a series of push&#8208;pull heptamethines containing the tricyanofuran (TCF) acceptors and indoline or benzo[e]indoline donors. These dipolar chromophores can attain a highly delocalized &#8220;cyanine&#8208;like&#8221; electronic ground state in solvents spanning a wide range of polarities, in some cases even closer to the ideal polymethine state than symmetrical cyanines.&#160;We use a transmission&#8208;mode electromodulation spectroscopy to study the electric&#8208;field&#8208;induced changes in optical absorption and refraction of polymer films doped with heptamethine chromophores, and obtain large and thermally stable QEO effect with high efficiency&#8208;loss figure&#8208;of&#8208;merits that compare favorably to those from dipolar polyenes in poled or unpoled polymers and III&#8208;V semiconductors.&#160;Our study opens a path for developing organic materials based on cyanine&#8208;like merocyanines for CMOS&#8208;compatible, fast, efficient, and low&#8208;loss electro&#8208;optic modulation.

         <title>Boosting Solid&#8208;State Reconversion Reactivity to Mitigate Lithium Trapping for High Initial Coulombic Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Accepted Article. </description>
         <dc:description>
Abstract
An initial Coulombic efficiency (ICE) higher than 90% is crucial for industrial lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), but numerous electrode materials are not standards compliant. Lithium trapping, due to (i) incomplete solid&#8208;state reaction of Li+ generation and (ii) sluggish Li+ diffusion, undermines ICE in high&#8208;capacity electrodes (e.g., conversion&#8208;type electrodes). Current approaches mitigating lithium trapping emphasize the (ii) by nanoscaling (&lt; 50&#160;nm) to minimize Li+ diffusion distance, whereas followed by severe solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formation and inferior volumetric energy density. Herein,&#160;we accentuate the (i) instead, to demonstrate that the lithium trapping can be mitigated by boosting the solid&#8208;state reaction reactivity. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, ternary LiFeO2 anodes, whose discharged products contain highly reactive vacancy&#8208;rich Fe nanoparticles, can alleviate lithium trapping and enable a remarkable average ICE of &#8764;92.77%, much higher than binary Fe2O3 anodes (&#8764;75.19%). Synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and theoretical simulations reveal that the solid&#8208;state reconversion reaction for Li+ generation between Fe and Li2O can be effectively promoted by the Fe&#8208;vacancy&#8208;rich local chemical environment. The superior ICE is further demonstrated by assembled pouch cells. This work proposes a novel paradigm of regulating intrinsic solid&#8208;state chemistry to ameliorate electrochemical performance and facilitate industrial applications of various advanced electrode materials.

         <title>2D&#8208;Layer&#8208;Structure Bi To Quasi&#8208;1D&#8208;Structure NiBi3: Structural Dimensionality Reduction to Superior Sodium and Potassium Ion Storage</title>

Abstract
Layer&#8208;structured Bismuth (Bi) is an attractive anode for Na&#8208;ion and K&#8208;ion batteries due to its large volumetric capacity and suitable redox potentials. However, the cycling stability and rate capability of the Bi anode are restricted by the large volume expansion and sluggish Na/K&#8208;storage kinetics. Herein, a structural dimensionality reduction strategy is proposed and developed by converting 2D&#8208;layer&#8208;structured Bi into a quasi&#8208;one&#8208;dimensional (quasi&#8208;1D) structured NiBi3 with enhanced reaction kinetics and reversibility to realize high&#8208;rate and stable cycling performance for Na/K&#8208;ion storage. As a proof of concept, the quasi&#8208;1D intermetallic NiBi3 with low formation energy, metallic conductivity, and three&#8208;dimensional (3D) Na/K&#8208;ion diffusion pathways delivers outstanding capacity retention of 94.1% (332 mAh g&#8722;1) after 15000 cycles for Na&#8208;ion storage, and high initial coulombic efficiency (ICE) of 93.4% with improved capacity retention for K&#8208;ion storage. Moreover, investigations on the highly reversible Na/K&#8208;storage reaction mechanisms and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction further reveal the origins of the high reversibility and the accommodation to volume expansion. The finding of this work provides a new strategy for high&#8208;performance anode design by structure dimensionality manipulation and cycling&#8208;driven morphology reconstruction.

         <title>MoS2@Polyaniline for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
NH4+ is made of extremely abundant elements and has a lower molar mass (18&#160;g&#160;mol&#8722;1) and a smaller hydrated radius (3.3&#160;&#197;) than most metal ions. These characteristics and the formation of hydrogen bonds between the metal oxide and NH4+ facilitate fast diffusion kinetics and reversible reaction. This work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion aqueous supercapacitors are raising notable attention owing to their cost, safety, and environmental advantages, but the development of optimized electrode materials for ammonium&#8208;ion storage still lacks behind expectations. To overcome current challenges, here, a sulfide&#8208;based composite electrode based on MoS2 and polyaniline (MoS2@PANI) is proposed as an ammonium&#8208;ion host. The optimized composite possesses specific capacitances above 450&#160;F&#160;g&#8722;1 at 1&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and 86.3% capacitance retention after 5000 cycles in a three&#8208;electrode configuration. PANI not only contributes to the electrochemical performance but also plays a key role in defining the final MoS2 architecture. Symmetric supercapacitors assembled with such electrodes display energy densities above 60&#160;Wh&#160;kg&#8722;1 at a power density of 725&#160;W&#160;kg&#8722;1. Compared with Li+ and K+ ions, the surface capacitive contribution in NH4+&#8208;based devices is lower at every scan rate, which points to an effective generation/breaking of H&#8208;bonds as the mechanism controlling the rate of NH4+ insertion/de&#8208;insertion. This result is supported by density functional theory calculations, which also show that sulfur vacancies effectively enhance the NH4+ adsorption energy and improve the electrical conductivity of the whole composite. Overall, this work demonstrates the great potential of composite engineering in optimizing the performance of ammonium&#8208;ion insertion electrodes.

         <title>Tunable, Wide&#8208;Temperature, and Macroscale Superlubricity Enabled by Nanoscale Van Der Waals Heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;Homojunction Transformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
By van der Waals (vdW) composite (graphene/MoS2 etc.) nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion under graphene edge&#8208;oxygen incorporation, a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions is formed on the grinding balls. Tunable, wide&#8208;temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C) and macroscale superlubricity (0.005) is achieved on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces by nanoscale vdW heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation unlike traditional incommensurability&#8208;to&#8208;commensurability theory.








Abstract
Achieving macroscale superlubricity of van der Waals (vdW) nanopowders is particularly challenging, due to the difficulty in forming ordered junctions before friction and the friction&#8208;induced complex contact restructuration among multiple nanometer&#8208;sized junctions. Here, a facile way is reported to achieve vdW nanopowder&#8208;to&#8208;heterojunction conversion by graphene edge&#8208;oxygen (GEO) incorporation. The GEO effectively weakens the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane edge&#8211;edge and in&#8208;plane plane&#8211;edge states of the vdW nanopowder, leading to a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions on the grinding balls. When sliding on diamond&#8208;like carbon surfaces, the ball&#8208;supported structure governs macroscale superlubricity by heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation among the countless nanoscale junctions. Furthermore, the transformation guides the tunable design of superlubricity, achieving superlubricity (&#181;&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.005) at wide ranges of load, velocity, and temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C). Atomistic simulations reveal the GEO&#8208;enhanced conversion of vdW nanopowder to heterojunctions and demonstrate the heterojunction&#8208;to&#8208;homojunction transformation superlubricity mechanism. The findings are of significance for the macroscopic scale&#8208;up and engineering application of structural superlubricity.

Tunable, wide-temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C) and macroscale superlubricity (0.005) is achieved on diamond-like carbon surfaces by nanoscale vdW heterojunction-to-homojunction transformation unlike traditional incommensurability-to-commensurability theory.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving macroscale superlubricity of van der Waals (vdW) nanopowders is particularly challenging, due to the difficulty in forming ordered junctions before friction and the friction-induced complex contact restructuration among multiple nanometer-sized junctions. Here, a facile way is reported to achieve vdW nanopowder-to-heterojunction conversion by graphene edge-oxygen (GEO) incorporation. The GEO effectively weakens the out-of-plane edge&#8211;edge and in-plane plane&#8211;edge states of the vdW nanopowder, leading to a coexistent structure of nanoscale homojunctions and heterojunctions on the grinding balls. When sliding on diamond-like carbon surfaces, the ball-supported structure governs macroscale superlubricity by heterojunction-to-homojunction transformation among the countless nanoscale junctions. Furthermore, the transformation guides the tunable design of superlubricity, achieving superlubricity (&lt;i&gt;&#181;&lt;/i&gt;&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.005) at wide ranges of load, velocity, and temperature (&#8722;200 to 300&#160;&#176;C). Atomistic simulations reveal the GEO-enhanced conversion of vdW nanopowder to heterojunctions and demonstrate the heterojunction-to-homojunction transformation superlubricity mechanism. The findings are of significance for the macroscopic scale-up and engineering application of structural superlubricity.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Free and Skin&#8208;Like Supramolecular Ion&#8208;Conductive Elastomers with Versatile Processability for Multifunctional Ionic Tattoos and On&#8208;Skin Bioelectronics</title>

         <dc:description>
Solvent&#8208;free and skin&#8208;like supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomers with high stability and excellent biocompatibility are reported, which can be simply processed into scalable and customized ionic&#8208;tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) by painting and printing methods. The I&#8208;tattoos can work as ultraconformal on&#8208;skin electrodes for long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity acquisition of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts, enabling human&#8211;machine interactions and multichannel digital diagnosis.








Abstract
The development of stable and biocompatible soft ionic conductors, alternatives to hydrogels and ionogels, will open up new avenues for the construction of stretchable electronics. Here, a brand&#8208;new design, encapsulating a naturally occurring ionizable compound by a biocompatible polymer via high&#8208;density hydrogen bonds, resulting in a solvent&#8208;free supramolecular ion&#8208;conductive elastomer (SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE) that eliminates the dehydration problem of hydrogels and possesses excellent biocompatibility, is reported. The SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE with high ionic conductivity (&gt;3.3&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#8722;2&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1) exhibits skin&#8208;like softness and strain&#8208;stiffening behaviors, excellent elasticity, breathability, and self&#8208;adhesiveness. Importantly, the SF&#8208;supra&#8208;ICE can be obtained by a simple water evaporation step to solidify the aqueous precursor into a solvent&#8208;free nature. Therefore, the aqueous precursor can act as inks to be painted and printed into customized ionic tattoos (I&#8208;tattoos) for the construction of multifunctional on&#8208;skin bioelectronics. The painted I&#8208;tattoos exhibit ultraconformal and seamless contact with human skin, enabling long&#8208;term and high&#8208;fidelity recording of various electrophysiological signals with extraordinary immunity to motion artifacts. Human&#8211;machine interactions are achieved by exploiting the painted I&#8208;tattoos to transmit the electrophysiological signals of human beings. Stretchable I&#8208;tattoo electrode arrays, manufactured by the printing method, are demonstrated for multichannel digital diagnosis of the health condition of human back muscles and spine.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Uniform and Functionalized Nano&#8208;Ion Divider for Regulating Ion Distribution toward Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium&#8208;Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional ion&#8208;divider (M&#8208;NC@MXene) with homogeneous nanopores and doped single atoms is designed and fabricated to enable physical and chemical redistribution of Li ions, impede the transport of anions, and prevent the formation of Li dendrites in various Li&#8208;metal battery systems. The multifunctionality of the divider is validated through experiments, first&#8208;principles simulations, and phase&#8208;field modeling.








Abstract
Ionic dividers with uniform pores and functionalized surfaces display significant potential for solving Li&#8208;dendrite issues in Li&#8208;metal batteries. In this study, single metal and nitrogen co&#8208;doped carbon&#8208;sandwiched MXene (M&#8208;NC@MXene) nanosheets are designed and fabricated, which possess highly ordered nanochannels with a diameter of &#8776;10&#160;nm. The experiments and computational calculations verified that the M&#8208;NC@MXene nanosheets eliminate Li dendrites in several ways: (1) redistributing the Li&#8208;ion flux via the highly ordered ion channels, (2) selectively conducting Li ions and anchoring anions by heteroatom doping to extend the nucleation time for Li dendrites, and (3) tightly staggering on a routine polypropylene (PP) separator to obstruct the growth path of Li dendrites. With a Zn&#8208;NC@MXene&#8208;coated PP divider, the assembled Li||Li symmetric battery shows an ultralow overpotential of &#8776;25&#160;mV and a cycle life of 1500&#160;h at a high current density of 3&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and high capacity of 3 mAh cm&#8722;2. Remarkably, the life of a Li||Ni83 pouch cell with an energy density of 305&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1 is improved by fivefold. Moreover, the remarkable performance of Li||Li, Li||LiFePO4, and Li||sulfur batteries reveal the significant potential of the well&#8208;designed multifunctional ion divider for further practical applications.

         <title>Quantitative Mapping of Chemical Defects at Charged Grain Boundaries in a Ferroelectric Oxide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic properties and chemical composition at grain boundaries in ferroelectric ErMnO3 polycrystals are studied. Atom probe tomography shows that the chemical structure at grain boundaries is substantially different from the bulk, revealing the microscopic origin of their distinct electronic responses. The work demonstrates the benefit of quantitative atomic&#8208;scale measurements and additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.








Abstract
Polar discontinuities, as well as compositional and structural changes at oxide interfaces can give rise to a large variety of electronic and ionic phenomena. In contrast to earlier work focused on domain walls and epitaxial systems, this work investigates the relation between polar discontinuities and the local chemistry at grain boundaries in polycrystalline ferroelectric ErMnO3. Using orientation mapping and scanning probe microscopy (SPM) techniques, the polycrystalline material is demonstrated to develop charged grain boundaries with enhanced electronic conductance. By performing atom probe tomography (APT) measurements, an enrichment of erbium and a depletion of oxygen at all grain boundaries are found. The observed compositional changes translate into a charge that exceeds possible polarization&#8208;driven effects, demonstrating that structural phenomena rather than electrostatics determine the local chemical composition and related changes in the electronic transport behavior. The study shows that the charged grain boundaries behave distinctly different from charged domain walls, giving additional opportunities for property engineering at polar oxide interfaces.

         <title>Stabilizing Supersaturation with Extreme Grain Refinement in Spinodal Aluminum Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
It is challenging to stabilize supersaturated solid solutions against the spinodal decomposition that occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. It is found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited by straining&#8208;induced grain refinement into the nanoscale when a stable Schwarz crystal structure is formed.








Abstract
Supersaturated solid solutions can be formed in alloys from various non&#8208;equilibrium processes, but stabilizing the metastable phases against decomposition is challenging,&#160;particularly the spinodal decomposition that occurs via chemical fluctuations without energy barriers to nucleation. In this work, it is found that spinodal decomposition in supersaturated Al(Zn) solid solutions can be inhibited with straining&#8208;induced extreme grain refinement. For the refined supersaturated grains at the nanoscale, their spinodal decomposition is obviously resisted by the relaxed grain boundaries and reduced lattice defects. As grains are refined below 10&#160;nm the decomposition is completely inhibited, in which atomic diffusion is blocked by the stable Schwarz crystal structure with vacancy&#8208;free grains. Extreme grain refinement offers a general approach to stabilize supersaturated phases with broadened compositional windows for property modulation of alloys.

         <title>Lattice Strain Regulation Enables High&#8208;Performance Formamidinium Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The PYBA cation is used as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, which induces a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The external compression strain provided by the PYBA pairs compensates for the inherent tension strain of the FAPbI3 crystals. As a result, the strain&#8208;regulated formamidinium PSC exhibits an improved PCE.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite possesses an ideal optical bandgap and is a potential material for fabricating the most efficient single&#8208;junction perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Nevertheless, large formamidinium (FA) cations result in residual lattice strain, which reduces the power conversion efficiency (PCE) and operational stability of PSCs. Herein, the modulation of lattice strain in FAPbI3 crystals via a &#960;&#8208;conjugated organic amine, i.e., 4&#8208;pyrene oxy butylamine (PYBA), is proposed. PYBA pairs at the grain boundary serve as a template for the crystallization of FAPbI3 perovskite, thereby inducing a highly oriented crystal and a pure &#945;&#8208;phase film. The PYBA pairs with strong &#960;&#8211;&#960; interactions provide a solid fulcrum for external compression strain, thus compensating for the inherent tension strain of FAPbI3 crystals. The strain release elevates the valence band of the perovskite crystals, thereby decreasing the bandgap and trap density. Consequently, the PYBA&#8208;regulated FAPbI3 PSC achieves an excellent PCE of 24.76%. Moreover, the resulting device exhibits improves operational stability and maintains over 80% of its initial PCE after 1500&#160;h under maximum power point tracking conditions.

         <title>Realizing Photocatalytic Overall Water Splitting by Modulating the Thickness&#8208;Induced Reaction Energy Barrier of Fluorenone&#8208;Based Covalent Organic Frameworks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel ultrathin three&#8208;layer structure of fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) is successfully constructed to realize photocatalytic overall water splitting. Reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets is found to increase&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduce the distance for charge migration distance, prolong the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decrease the Gibbs free energy of rate&#8208;limiting step for oxygen evolution.








Abstract
Direct photocatalytic hydrogen and oxygen evolution from water splitting is an attractive approach for producing chemical fuels. In this work, a novel fluorenone&#8208;based covalent organic framework (COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) is successfully exfoliated into ultrathin three&#8208;layer nanosheets (UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2) for photocatalytic overall water splitting (OWS) under visible light. The ultrathin structures of UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 greatly enhance carrier separation, utilization efficiency, and the exposure of active surface sites. Surprisingly, UCOF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 exhibits efficient photocatalytic OWS performance, with hydrogen and oxygen evolution rates reaching 0.046 and 0.021 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1, respectively,&#160;under visible&#8208;light irradiation, whereas bulk COF&#8208;SCAU&#8208;2 shows no activity for photocatalytic OWS. Charge&#8208;carrier kinetic analysis and DFT calculations confirm that reducing the thickness of the COF nanosheets increases&#160;the number of&#160;accessible active sites, reduces the distance for charge migration, prolongs the lifetimes of photogenerated carriers, and decreases the Gibbs free energy of the rate&#8208;limiting step compared to nonexfoliated COFs. This work offers new insights into the effect of the layer thickness of COFs on photocatalytic OWS.

         <title>Linker Engineering of Sandwich&#8208;Structured Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Composites for Optimized Photocatalytic H2 Production</title>

Sandwich&#8208;like UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X = &#9472;H, &#9472;Br, &#9472;NA (naphthalene for short), &#9472;OCH3, &#9472;Cl, &#9472;NO2) composites are constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. The &#9472;X group reversely regulates the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, giving rise to a volcano&#8208;like activity trend of the composites along with increasing electron&#8208;withdrawing ability of the &#9472;X group.








Abstract
While the microenvironment around catalytic sites is recognized to be crucial in thermocatalysis, its roles in photocatalysis remain subtle. In this work, a series of sandwich&#8208;structured metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF) composites, UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X (X means functional groups), is rationally constructed for visible&#8208;light photocatalytic H2 production. By varying the &#9472;X groups of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;X shell, the microenvironment of the Pt sites and photosensitive UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core can be simultaneously modulated. Significantly, the MOF composites with identical light absorption and Pt loading present distinctly different photocatalytic H2 production rates, following the &#9472;X group sequence of &#9472;H&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Br&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NA (naphthalene)&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;OCH3&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;Cl&#160;&gt;&#160;&#9472;NO2. UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H demonstrates H2 production rate up to 2708.2&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, &#8776;222 times that of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NO2. Mechanism investigations suggest that the variation of the &#9472;X group can balance the charge separation of the UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2 core and the proton reduction ability of Pt, leading to an optimal activity of UiO&#8208;66&#8208;NH2@Pt@UiO&#8208;66&#8208;H at the equilibrium point.

         <title>Metal&#8208;Bonded Atomic Layers of Transition Metal Carbides (MXenes)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Accordion&#8208;like metal&#8208;bonded transition metal carbides (MXenes) are produced through a topological reaction between Cl&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, which is driven by the crystal symmetry of the MAX phases. After the delamination and assembling, the films composed of Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx MXene atomic layers exhibit high oxidation resistance and low sheet resistances, affording a significantly enhanced property in electromagnetic interference (EMI) sheilding.








Abstract
Although 2D transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXenes) have fantastic physical and chemical properties as well as wide applications, it remains challenging to produce stable MXenes due to their rapid structural degradation. Here, unique metal&#8208;bonded atomic layers of transition metal carbides with high stabilities are produced via a simple topological reaction between chlorine&#8208;terminated MXenes and selected metals, where the metals enable them to not only remove partially Cl terminations, but also bond with adjacent atomic MXene slabs, driven by the symmetry of MAX phases. The films constructed from Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx atomic layers show high oxidation resistance up to 400&#160;&#176;C and low sheet resistance of 9.3&#160;&#937;&#160;sq&#8722;1. Coupled to the multilayer structure, the Al&#8208;bonded Ti3C2Clx film displays a significantly improved electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding capability with a total shielding effectiveness value of 39&#160;dB at a low thickness of 3.1&#160;&#181;m, outperforming pure Ti3C2Clx film.

         <title>Macrocyclic Engineering of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Emitters for High&#8208;Efficiency Organic Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of delayed fluorescent macrocycles is successfully synthesized via a modular strategy. Among them, MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X show perfect photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%) due to more ideal macrocyclic structure and larger oscillator strength. Therefore, organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on MC&#8208;XT and MC&#8208;X achieve record&#8208;high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 31.6%, respectively.








Abstract
Several thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials&#160;have been studied and developed to realize high&#8208;performance organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, TADF macrocycles have not been sufficiently investigated owing to the synthetic challenges, resulting in limited exploration of their luminescent properties and the corresponding highly efficient OLEDs.

&lt;p&gt;A class of delayed fluorescent macrocycles is successfully synthesized via a modular strategy. Among them, MC-XT and MC-X show perfect photoluminescence quantum yields (&#8776;100%) due to more ideal macrocyclic structure and larger oscillator strength. Therefore, organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on MC-XT and MC-X achieve record-high maximum external quantum efficiencies of 26.9% and 31.6%, respectively.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials&#160;have been studied and developed to realize high-performance organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). However, TADF macrocycles have not been sufficiently investigated owing to the synthetic challenges, resulting in limited exploration of their luminescent properties and the corresponding highly efficient OLEDs. In this study, a series of TADF macrocycles is synthesized using a modularly tunable strategy by introducing xanthones as acceptors and phenylamine derivatives as donors. A detailed analysis of their photophysical properties combined with fragment molecules reveals characteristics of high-performance macrocycles. The results indicate that: a) the ideal structure decreases the energy loss, which in turn reduces the non-radiative transitions; b) reasonable building blocks increase the oscillator strength providing a higher radiation transition rate; c) the horizontal dipole orientation (&#920;) of the extended macrocyclic emitters is increased.

         <title>Biodegradable NIR&#8208;II Pseudo Conjugate Polymeric Nanoparticles Amplify Photodynamic Immunotherapy via Alleviation of Tumor Hypoxia and Tumor&#8208;Associated Macrophage Reprogramming</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A NIR&#8208;II biodegradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). Under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg can on the one hand efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. On the other hand, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in more ROS generation to eradicate tumor cells while inducing ICD to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. Furthermore, Reg can reprogram TAMs from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive TME.








Abstract
Photodynamic therapy (PDT) has achieved great success in cancer treatment. Despite its great promise, the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy can be limited by the hypoxia in solid tumors which is closely related to the abnormal tumor vasculature. These abnormal vasculatures are a hallmark of most solid tumors and facilitate immune evasion. Therefore, tumor vascular normalization is developed as a promising strategy to overcome tumor hypoxia, resulting in improved cancer therapy. Here, a NIR&#8208;II bio&#8208;degradable pseudo&#8208;conjugate polymer (PSP)&#8208;based photodynamic polymer is designed to deliver a vascular normalization agent, i.e., regorafenib (Reg) in nanoparticles (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg). NP&#8208;PDT@Reg under 808&#160;nm laser irradiation (NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L) can efficiently release Reg to improve the tumor hypoxia via vascular normalization, making more NP&#8208;PDT@Reg and oxygen enter the tumors. Moreover, NP&#8208;PDT@Reg + L can further result in generation of more reactive oxygen species (ROS) to eradicate tumor cells while inducing immunogenic cell death (ICD) to activate anti&#8208;tumor immune responses. In addition, Reg can reprogram TAM from a pro&#8208;tumor M2 phenotype to a tumor&#8208;killing M1 phenotype as well, thereby reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. Taken together, the current study provides an innovative perspective on the development of novel nanomaterials to overcome the limitations in photodynamic immunotherapy.

         <title>Composite Spin Hall Conductivity from Non&#8208;Collinear Antiferromagnetic Order</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low symmetry non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets allow longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization that are anisotropic in orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin Hall conductivities with &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ components are found in L12&#8208;ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn3 thin films with large spin torque efficiencies and orientation&#8208;dependent anisotropy, a pathway to efficient spintronic devices with selectable spin polarization.








Abstract
Non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets (AFMs) are an exciting new platform for studying intrinsic spin Hall effects (SHEs), phenomena that arise from the materials&#8217; band structure, Berry phase curvature, and linear response to an external electric field. In contrast to conventional SHE materials, symmetry analysis of non&#8208;collinear antiferromagnets does not forbid non&#8208;zero longitudinal and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin currents with x&#770;,z&#770;$\hat{x},\hat{z}$ polarization and predicts an anisotropy with current orientation to the magnetic lattice. Here, multi&#8208;component out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin Hall conductivities &#963;xzx,$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{x}},$ &#963;xzy,&#963;xzz$\sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{y}},\ \sigma _{{\rm{xz}}}^{\rm{z}}$ are reported in L12&#8208;ordered antiferromagnetic PtMn3 thin films that are uniquely generated in the non&#8208;collinear state. The maximum spin torque efficiencies (&#958;&#8197; = JS&#8197;/Je&#8197;&#8776; 0.3) are significantly larger than in Pt (&#958;&#8197; &#8776; &#8197;0.1). Additionally, the spin Hall conductivities in the non&#8208;collinear state exhibit the predicted orientation&#8208;dependent anisotropy, opening the possibility for new devices with selectable spin polarization. This work demonstrates symmetry control through the magnetic lattice as a pathway to tailored functionality in magnetoelectronic systems.

         <title>Ion&#8211;Dipole Interaction Enabling Highly Efficient CsPbI3 Perovskite Indoor Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The amino naphthalene sulfonates (ANS) molecules are incorporated as a dipolar interlayer at the buried interface to fabricate CsPbI3 perovskite indoor photovoltaics (PIPVs). The strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between polar ANS molecules and ionic perovskites enables the target PIPVs to deliver a record indoor PCE of up to 41.2% (Pout:137.66&#8201;&#181;W&#8201;cm&#8722;2) under a standard LED light source (2956&#8201;K, 1062&#8201;lux).








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites are ideal candidates for indoor photovoltaics (IPVs) because of their easy&#8208;to&#8208;adjust bandgaps, which can be designed to cover the spectrum of any artificial light source. However, the serious non&#8208;radiative carrier recombination under low light illumination restrains the application of perovskite&#8208;based IPVs (PIPVs). Herein, polar molecules of amino naphthalene sulfonates are employed to functionalize the TiO2 substrate, anchoring the CsPbI3 perovskite crystal grains with a strong ion&#8211;dipole interaction between the molecule&#8208;level polar interlayer and the ionic perovskite film. The resulting high&#8208;quality CsPbI3 films with the merit of defect&#8208;immunity and large shunt resistance under low light conditions enable the corresponding PIPVs with an indoor power conversion efficiency of up to 41.2% (Pin: 334.11&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2, Pout: 137.66&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) under illumination from a commonly used indoor light&#8208;emitting diode light source (2956 K, 1062 lux). Furthermore, the device also achieves efficiencies of 29.45% (Pout: 9.80&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 32.54% (Pout: 54.34&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) at 106 (Pin: 33.84&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) and 522 lux (Pin: 168.21&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2), respectively.

         <title>Engineering of Defective MOF&#8208;801 Nanostructures within Macroporous Spheres for Highly Efficient and Stable Water Harvesting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Crystallization of MOF&#8208;801 on the surface of macroporous poly (N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres via a facile in situ confinement growth strategy to easily form smart spherical composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. The composite is successfully produced in kilogram&#8208;scale. The reduced crystals size and the formation of abundant defects endow the composite with an unprecedented high water&#8208;collection efficiency.








Abstract
Water harvesting using the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;801 is restricted by limited working capacity, powder structuring, and finite stability. To overcome these issues, MOF&#8208;801 is crystallized on the surface of macroporous poly(N&#8208;isopropylacrylamide&#8208;glycidyl methacrylate) spheres, called P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA), through an in situ confined growth strategy, forming spherical MOF&#8208;801@P(NIPAM&#8208;GMA) composite with temperature&#8208;responsive function. By lowering the nucleation energy barrier, the average size of the MOF&#8208;801 crystals decreases by 20 times. Thus, abundant defects as adsorption sites for water can be installed in the crystals lattices. As a consequence, the composite provides an unprecedented high water harvesting efficiency. The composite is produced in the kilogram&#8208;scale and can capture 1.60&#160;kg H2O/kg composite/day from 20% relative humidity between 25 and 85&#160;&#176;C. This study provides an effective methodology for improving the adsorption capacity through controlled defects formation as adsorption sites and to improve the kinetics through the design of a composite with macroporous transport channel network.

         <title>Cyano&#8208;Functionalized Fused Bithiophene Imide Dimer&#8208;Based n&#8208;Type Polymers for High&#8208;Performance Organic Thermoelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of cyano&#8208;functionalized bithiophene imide dimerbased n&#8208;type polymers are synthesized, featuring good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. By adopting solution&#8208;shearing assisted film&#8208;forming technology, acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivered a record power factor of 110.3 &#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2. The study is informative for development of high&#8208;performance organic thermoelectrics.








Abstract
Doped n&#8208;type polymers usually exhibit low electrical conductivities and thermoelectric power factors (PFs), restricting the development of high&#8208;performance p&#8211;n&#8208;junction&#8208;based organic thermoelectrics (OTEs). Herein, the design and synthesis of a new cyano&#8208;functionalized fused bithiophene imide dimer (f&#8208;BTI2), CNI2, is reported, which synergistically combines the advantages of both cyano and imide functionalities, thus leading to substantially higher electron deficiency than the parent f&#8208;BTI2. On the basis of this novel building block, a series of n&#8208;type donor&#8211;acceptor and acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymers are successfully synthesized, all of which show good solubility, deep&#8208;lying frontier molecular orbital levels, and favorable polymer chain orientation. Among them, the acceptor&#8211;acceptor polymer PCNI2&#8208;BTI delivers an excellent electrical conductivity up to 150.2&#160;S&#160;cm&#8722;1 and a highest PF of 110.3&#160;&#181;W&#160;m&#8722;1&#160;K&#8722;2 in n&#8208;type OTEs, attributed to the optimized polymer electronic properties and film morphology with improved molecular packing and higher crystallinity assisted by solution&#8208;shearing technology. The PF value is the record of n&#8208;type polymers for OTEs to date. This work demonstrates a facile approach to designing high&#8208;performance n&#8208;type polymers and fabricating high&#8208;quality films for OTE applications.

         <title>Ultrasound&#8208;Assisted Crystallization Enables Large&#8208;Area Perovskite Quasi&#8208;Monocrystalline Film for High&#8208;Sensitive X&#8208;ray Detection and Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>

A large&#8208;area (10&#8201;cm&#8201;&#215;&#8201;10&#8201;cm) high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film (QCF) of mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 is achieved via ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method. The device based on MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 QCF reaches an impressively high sensitivity of 1.16&#8201;&#215;&#8201;106 &#181;C&#8201;Gyair&#8722;1&#8201;cm&#8722;2 and a low limit of detection of 37.4&#8201;nGyair&#8201;s&#8722;1, demonstrating the high potential toward X&#8208;ray detection and imaging applications.








Abstract
In recent years, halide perovskites have shown great application potential in X&#8208;ray detection due to their superior optoelectronic properties and high X&#8208;ray attenuation coefficient. However, large&#8208;area perovskite fabrication for high performance X&#8208;ray detectors remains extremely challenging. Herein, ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization combined with the hot&#8208;pressing method is proposed to prepare large&#8208;area (10&#160;cm &#215; 10&#160;cm) and high&#8208;quality quasi&#8208;monocrystalline thick film of a mixed&#8208;cation perovskite MA0.42FA0.58PbI3. The rapid ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization provides more homogeneous nucleation, which is essential to the fabrication of large&#8208;area and uniform perovskite microcrystalline film. Furthermore, the post hot&#8208;pressing treatment is implemented to fuse the crystal boundaries, rearrange the crystal grains, and eliminate the voids between crystals, resulting in a quasi&#8208;monocrystalline film. After the hot&#8208;pressing treatment, the carrier mobility and the carrier mobility&#8208;lifetime product increased about 13&#8208;fold (from 1.8 to 23.5 cm2 s&#8722;1 V&#8722;1) and 18 times (from 8.4 &#215; 10&#8722;6 to 1.5 &#215; 10&#8722;4 cm2 V&#8722;1), respectively. As a result, a high&#8208;performance MA0.42FA0.58PbI3 quasi&#8208;monocrystalline X&#8208;ray detector is achieved with an impressively high sensitivity (1.16 &#215; 106 &#181;C Gyair&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) and low detection limit (37.4 nGyair s&#8722;1), demonstrating the potential of the ultrasound&#8208;assisted crystallization and hot&#8208;pressing strategy from an industrial perspective.

         <title>Entering Voltage Hysteresis in Phase&#8208;Separating Materials: Revealing the Electrochemical Signature of the Intraparticle Phase&#8208;Separated State</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A phase&#8208;separating material can feature different potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current within and outside voltage hysteresis. This fundamental material&#8208;related challenge is interrelated to a newly observed electrochemical signature of the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state featuring different electrode potential compared to the interparticle phase&#8208;separated state.








Abstract
Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in various materials. Usually, hysteretic behavior is an intrinsic property that cannot be circumvented in the nonequilibrium operation of the system. Herein, it is shown that, at least with regard to the hysteretic behavior of phase&#8208;separating battery materials, it is possible to enter (deeply) the hysteretic loop at finite battery currents. This newly observed electric response of the electrode, which is inherent to phase&#8208;separating materials, is related to its microscopic origin arising from a (significant) share of the active material residing in an intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state. This intriguing observation is further generalized by revealing that a phase&#8208;separating material can feature (significantly) different chemical potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current and external voltage hysteresis. Therefore, the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state significantly affects the DC and AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence for entering the intraparticle phase&#8208;separated state is supported by thermodynamic reasoning and advanced modeling.

     alt="Entering Voltage Hysteresis in Phase-Separating Materials: Revealing the Electrochemical Signature of the Intraparticle Phase-Separated State"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A phase-separating material can feature different potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current within and outside voltage hysteresis. This fundamental material-related challenge is interrelated to a newly observed electrochemical signature of the intraparticle phase-separated state featuring different electrode potential compared to the interparticle phase-separated state.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hysteresis is a general phenomenon regularly observed in various materials. Usually, hysteretic behavior is an intrinsic property that cannot be circumvented in the nonequilibrium operation of the system. Herein, it is shown that, at least with regard to the hysteretic behavior of phase-separating battery materials, it is possible to enter (deeply) the hysteretic loop at finite battery currents. This newly observed electric response of the electrode, which is inherent to phase-separating materials, is related to its microscopic origin arising from a (significant) share of the active material residing in an intraparticle phase-separated state. This intriguing observation is further generalized by revealing that a phase-separating material can feature (significantly) different chemical potentials at the same bulk lithiation level and temperature when exposed to the same finite current and external voltage hysteresis. Therefore, the intraparticle phase-separated state significantly affects the DC and AC characteristics of the battery. The experimental evidence for entering the intraparticle phase-separated state is supported by thermodynamic reasoning and advanced modeling. The current findings will help advance the understanding, control, diagnostics, and monitoring of batteries composed of phase-separating materials while also providing pertinent motivation for the enhancement of battery design and performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Near&#8208;Theoretical Thermal Conductivity Silver Nanoflakes as Reinforcements in Gap&#8208;Filling Adhesives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Ag nanoflakes with intrinsic thermal conductivity (398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1) close to theoretical value are prepared using the &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; method. After directly blending with epoxy (18.6 vol%) without any complex surface modification, hybridization, and structural design, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the obtained gap&#8208;filling adhesive is &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art counterpart.








Abstract
The rapid development of highly integrated microelectronic devices causes urgent demands for advanced thermally conductive adhesives (TCAs) to solve the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer issue. Due to their natural 2D structure and isotropic thermal conductivity, metal nanoflakes are promising fillers blended with polymer to develop high&#8208;performance TCAs. However, achieving corresponding TCAs with thermal conductivity over 10&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at filler content below 30 vol% remains challenging so far. This longstanding bottleneck is mainly attributed to the fact that most current metal nanoflakes are prepared by &#8220;bottom&#8208;up&#8221; processes (e.g., solution&#8208;based chemical synthesis) and inevitably contain lattice defects or impurities, resulting in lower intrinsic thermal conductivities, only 20&#8211;65% of the theoretical value. Here, a &#8220;top&#8208;down&#8221; strategy by splitting highly purified Ag foil with nanoscale thickness is adopted to prepare 2D Ag nanoflakes with an intrinsic thermal conductivity of 398.2&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1, reaching 93% of the theoretical value. After directly blending with epoxy, the resultant Ag/epoxy exhibits a thermal conductivity of 15.1&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 at low filler content of 18.6 vol%. Additionally, in practical microelectronic cooling performance evaluations, the interfacial heat&#8208;transfer efficiency of the Ag/epoxy achieves &#8776;1.4 times that of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art commercial TCA.

         <title>Immunostimulatory DNA Hydrogel Enhances Protective Efficacy of Nanotoxoids against Bacterial Infection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanotoxoids formulated against methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus are embedded into an immunostimulatory DNA hydrogel. When used to vaccinate mice, the resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite effectively elicits antigen&#8208;specific humoral and cellular immune responses. This enhanced immunity enables strong protection against live bacterial infection in models of pneumonia and skin infection.








Abstract
While vaccines have been highly successful in protecting against various infections, there are still many high&#8208;priority pathogens for which there are no clinically approved formulations. To overcome this challenge, researchers have explored the use of nanoparticulate strategies for more effective antigen delivery to the immune system. Along these lines, nanotoxoids are a promising biomimetic platform that leverages cell membrane coating technology to safely deliver otherwise toxic bacterial antigens in their native form for antivirulence vaccination. Here, in order to further boost their immunogenicity, nanotoxoids formulated against staphylococcal &#945;&#8208;hemolysin are embedded into a DNA&#8208;based hydrogel with immunostimulatory CpG motifs. The resulting nanoparticle&#8211;hydrogel composite is injectable and improves the in vivo delivery of vaccine antigens while simultaneously stimulating nearby immune cells. This leads to elevated antibody production and stronger antigen&#8208;specific cellular immune responses. In murine models of pneumonia and skin infection caused by methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus, mice vaccinated with the hybrid vaccine formulation are well&#8208;protected. This work highlights the benefits of combining nanoparticulate antigen delivery systems with immunostimulatory hydrogels into a single platform, and the approach can be readily generalized to a wide range of infectious diseases.

         <title>Degeneracy Removal of Spin Bands in Collinear Antiferromagnets with Non&#8208;Interconvertible Spin&#8208;Structure Motif Pair</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energy bands in antiferromagnets with compensated magnetization are expected to maintain spin degeneracy without spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). In this work, collinear antiferromagnets with a spin&#8208;structure motif pair are shown,whose components cannot be interconverted by certain spatial transformation; these will show spin splitting. Such a motif&#8208;based rule allows easy discerning of spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets from conventional spin&#8208;degenerate antiferromagnets.








Abstract
Energy bands in antiferromagnets are supposed to be spin degenerate in the absence of spin&#8211;orbit coupling (SOC). Recent studies have identified formal symmetry conditions for antiferromagnetic crystals in which this degeneracy can be lifted, spin splitting,even in the vanishing SOC (i.e., non&#8208;relativistic) limit. Materials having such symmetries could enable spin&#8208;split antiferromagnetic spintronics without the burden of using heavy&#8208;atom compounds. However, the symmetry conditions that involve spin and magnetic symmetry are not always effective as practical material selection filters. Furthermore, these symmetry conditions do not readily disclose trends in the magnitude and momentum dependence of the spin&#8208;splitting energy. Here, it is shown that the formal symmetry conditions enabling spin&#8208;split antiferromagnets can be interpreted in terms of local motif pairs, such as octahedra or tetrahedra, each carrying opposite magnetic moments. Collinear antiferromagnets with such a spin&#8208;structure motif pair, whose components interconvert by neither translation nor spatial inversion, will show spin splitting. Such a real&#8208;space motif&#8208;based approach enables an easy way to identify and design materials (illustrated in real example materials) having spin splitting without the need for SOC, and offers insights into the momentum dependence and magnitude of the spin splitting.

         <title>Data&#8208;Class&#8208;Specific All&#8208;Optical Transformations and Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations are achieved using a diffractive neural network that is designed by deep learning. Experimentally validated at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, including near&#8208;infrared and terahertz wavelengths, these class&#8208;specific diffractive optical processors provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.








Abstract
Diffractive optical networks provide rich opportunities for visual computing tasks. Here, data&#8208;class&#8208;specific transformations that are all&#8208;optically performed between the input and output fields&#8208;of&#8208;view (FOVs) of a diffractive network are presented. The visual information of the objects is encoded into the amplitude (A), phase (P), or intensity (I) of the optical field at the input, which is all&#8208;optically processed by a data&#8208;class&#8208;specific diffractive network. At the output, an image sensor&#8208;array directly measures the transformed patterns, all&#8208;optically encrypted using the transformation matrices preassigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. All&#8208;optical class&#8208;specific transformations covering A &#8594; A, I &#8594; I, and P &#8594; I transformations using various image datasets are numerically demonstrated. The feasibility of this framework is also experimentally validated by fabricating class&#8208;specific I &#8594; I transformation diffractive networks and is successfully tested at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data&#8208;class&#8208;specific all&#8208;optical transformations provide a fast and energy&#8208;efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.

At the output, an image sensor-array directly measures the transformed patterns, all-optically encrypted using the transformation matrices preassigned to different data classes, i.e., a separate matrix for each data class. The original input images can be recovered by applying the correct decryption key (the inverse transformation) corresponding to the matching data class, while applying any other key will lead to loss of information. All-optical class-specific transformations covering &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt; &#8594; &lt;i&gt;A&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; &#8594; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt; &#8594; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; transformations using various image datasets are numerically demonstrated. The feasibility of this framework is also experimentally validated by fabricating class-specific &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; &#8594; &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; transformation diffractive networks and is successfully tested at different parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, i.e., 1550 nm and 0.75 mm wavelengths. Data-class-specific all-optical transformations provide a fast and energy-efficient method for image and data encryption, enhancing data security and privacy.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Continuous Room&#8208;Temperature Spin&#8208;Injection Modulation Achieved by Spin&#8208;Filtering Competition in Molecular Spin Valves</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
An innovative spin&#8208;filtering competition strategy is introduced to realize continuous and room&#8208;temperature spin&#8208;injection modulation in molecular spin valves. By precisely controlling the competition, the spin polarization and the magnetoresistance effect can be actively tuned or the sign can even be reversed. Both the experimental and calculation results further enrich the theory of spintronics and may bring novel functionalities.








Abstract
Abundant spin&#8208;related phenomena that originate from interfaces between ferromagnetic electrodes and molecular semiconductors have greatly enriched research in spintronics, and they are considered promising for realizing novel spintronic functionalities in the future. However, despite great effort, the interfacial effect cannot be precisely controlled to achieve steady and predictable functions, especially at room temperature, and this has gradually become a significant bottleneck in the development of molecular spintronics. In this study, an innovative spin&#8208;filtering&#8208;competition mechanism is proposed to continuously modulate the interfacial effect in molecular spin valves at room temperature. To form this novel mechanism, the original spin&#8208;filtering effect from pure cobalt competes with the newly generated one, which is induced by the bonding effect between cobalt and lithium fluoride. Subsequently, by precisely controlling competition through lithium fluoride coverage on the cobalt surface, continuous modulation of the spin&#8208;injection process can be successfully achieved at room temperature. Spin polarization of the injected current and magnetoresistance effect can be actively controlled or their sign can be completely reversed through this novel mechanism. This study provides an innovative approach and theory for precisely controlling spin&#8208;related interfacial effects, which may further promote the scientific and technological development of spintronics.

         <title>Ultracoherent Single&#8208;Electron Emission of Carbon Nanotubes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A double barrier structure is demonstrated to form at the carbon nanotube tip, evidenced by a staircase&#8208;like field&#8208;emission curve with equidistant conductance peaks. This enables single&#8208;electron emission with a large current of 1.5&#160;nA, ultralow energy spread of &#8776;10&#160;meV, and ultrasmall effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm, paving the way to atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.








Abstract
A single&#8208;electron emitter, based on a single quantized energy level, can potentially achieve ultimate temporal and spatial coherence with a large emission current, which is desirable for atomic&#8208;resolution electron probes. This is first developed by constructing a nano&#8208;object on a metal tip to form a quantized double barrier structure. However, the single&#8208;electron&#8208;emission current can only achieve a picoampere level due to the low electron tunneling rate of the heterojunction with large barrier width, which limits the practical applications. In this study, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) serve as a single&#8208;electron emitter and a current up to 1.5&#160;nA is demonstrated. The double barrier structure formed on the CNT tip enables a high tunneling rate (&#8776;1012&#160;s&#8722;1) due to the smaller barrier width. The emitter also shows high temporal coherence (energy dispersion of &#8776;10&#160;meV) and spatial coherence (effective source radius of &#8776;0.85&#160;nm). This work represents a highly coherent electron source to simplify the electron optics system of atomic&#8208;resolution electron microscopy and sub&#8208;10&#160;nm electron beam lithography.

         <title>Exchange&#8208;Biased Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;BST grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. A strong exchange coupling is found to fix interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular and cause an exchange biased QAH effect. The magnitude and sign of the exchange bias are further shown to be controlled by a field training process.








Abstract
The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect is characterized by a dissipationless chiral edge state with a quantized Hall resistance at zero magnetic field. Manipulating the QAH state is of great importance in both the understanding of topological quantum physics and the implementation of dissipationless electronics. Here, the QAH effect is realized in the magnetic topological insulator Cr&#8208;doped (Bi,Sb)2Te3 (CBST) grown on an uncompensated antiferromagnetic insulator Al&#8208;doped Cr2O3. Through polarized neutron reflectometry (PNR), a strong exchange coupling is found between CBST and Al&#8208;Cr2O3 surface spins fixing interfacial magnetic moments perpendicular to the film plane. The interfacial coupling results in an exchange&#8208;biased QAH effect. This study further demonstrates that the magnitude and sign of the exchange bias can be effectively controlled using a field training process to set the magnetization of the Al&#8208;Cr2O3 layer. It demonstrates the use of the exchange bias effect to effectively manipulate the QAH state, opening new possibilities in QAH&#8208;based spintronics.

         <title>Laser Derived Electron Transport Layers with Embedded p&#8211;n Heterointerfaces Enabling Planar Perovskite Solar Cells with Efficiency over 25%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Present work demonstrates an efficient strategy of the particle boundaries (PBs) embedding of multifunctional p&#8208;type semiconducting CdTe nanocrystals for inhibited carrier losses at PBs, which can serve as efficient PBs mediator for boosting the electrons mobility of TiO2 ETL by maximally three orders of magnitude and consequently result in a new benchmark PCE over 25% in planar PSCs.








Abstract
Electron transport layers (ETLs) with pronounced electron conducting capability are essential for high performance planar perovskite photovoltaics, with the great challenge being that the most widely used metal oxide ETLs unfortunately have intrinsically low carrier mobility. Herein is demonstrated that by simply addressing the carrier loss at particle boundaries of TiO2 ETLs, through embedding in ETL p&#8211;n heterointerfaces, the electron mobility of the ETLs can be boosted by three orders of magnitude. Such embedding is encouragingly favorable for both inhibiting the formation of rutile phase TiO2 in ETL, and initiating the growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite films with less defect states. By virtue of these merits, creation of formamidinium lead iodide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) with a champion efficiency of 25.05% is achieved, setting a new benchmark for planar PSCs employing TiO2 ETLs. Unencapsulated PSCs deliver much&#8208;improved environmental stability, i.e., more than 80% of their initial efficiency after 9000 h of air storage under RH of 40%, and over 90% of their initial efficiency at maximum power point under continuous illumination for 500 h. Further work exploring other p&#8208;type nanocrystals for embedding warrants the proposed strategy as a universal alternative for addressing the low&#8208;carrier mobility of metal oxide based ETLs.

         <title>Life&#8208;Cycle Assessment of Ti3C2Tx MXene Synthesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) of Ti3C2Tx MXene as an EMI&#8208;shielding coating is presented. MXene synthesis, including laboratory&#8208;scale systems and precursor generation utilizing TiO2, is examined for energy demand and environmental impacts. Findings demonstrate that laboratory electricity usage has the greatest impact on MXene production. Sustainable MXene synthesis toward the large&#8208;scale manufacturing of this intriguing 2D material is discussed.








Abstract
MXenes, 2D transition metal carbides, nitrides, and carbonitrides, have been investigated for diverse applications since their discovery; however, their life&#8208;cycle assessment (LCA) has not been studied. Here, a &#8220;cradle to gate&#8221; LCA is performed to assess the cumulative energy demand (CED) and environmental impacts of lab&#8208;scale synthesis of Ti3C2Tx, the most researched MXene composition. Electromagnetic interface (EMI) shielding is selected as it is one of MXenes' most promising applications and LCA of Ti3C2Tx synthesis is compared to aluminum and copper foils, two typical EMI&#8208;shielding materials. Two laboratory&#8208;scale MXene synthesis systems&#8212;gram and kilogram batches&#8212;are examined. The CED and environmental implications of Ti3C2Tx synthesis are investigated based on its precursor production, selective etching, delamination processes, laboratory location, energy mix, and raw material type. These&#160;results show that laboratory electricity usage for the synthesis processes accounts for &gt;70% of the environmental impacts. Manufacturing 1.0&#160;kg of industrial&#8208;scale aluminum and copper foil releases 23.0&#160;kg and 8.75&#160;kg of CO2, respectively, while 1.0&#160;kg of lab&#8208;scale MXene synthesis releases 428.10&#160;kg. Chemical usage is less impactful than electricity, which suggests that&#160;recycled resources and renewable energy can make MXene synthesis more sustainable. Understanding MXene LCA helps the industrialization of this material.

         <title>Achieving Highly Proton&#8208;Resistant Zn&#8211;Pb Anode through Low Hydrogen Affinity and Strong Bonding for Long&#8208;Life Electrolytic Zn//MnO2 Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pb&#8208;containing interface and Pb layer constructed in situ on a Zn substrate and Zn plating layer provide all&#8208;around protection for stable Zn anodes. Benefiting from the low H+ affinity and strong bonding, they show high hydrogen evolution corrosion resistance. Based on this, an electrolytic Zn//MnO2 battery achieves long&#8208;term cycling stability and ultra&#8208;high energy density in an acidic electrolyte.








Abstract
High&#8208;energy electrolytic Zn//MnO2 batteries show potential for grid&#8208;scale energy storage, but the severe hydrogen evolution corrosion (HEC) caused by acidic electrolytes results in subdued durability. Here, an all&#8208;around protection strategy is reported for achieving stable Zn metal anodes. First, a proton&#8208;resistant Pb&#8208;containing (Pb and Pb(OH)2) interface is constructed on a Zn anode (denoted as Zn@Pb), which in situ forms PbSO4 during H2SO4 corrosion and protects the Zn substrate from HEC. Second, to improve the plating/stripping reversibility of Zn@Pb, Pb(CH3COO)2 an additive (denoted as Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad) is introduced, which triggers PbSO4 precipitation and releases trace Pb2+ that can dynamically deposit a Pb layer on the Zn plating layer to suppress HEC. The superior HEC resistance stems from the low affinity of PbSO4 and Pb for H+, as well as strong bonding between Pb&#8211;Zn or Pb&#8211;Pb, which increase the hydrogen evolution reaction overpotential and the H+ corrosion energy barrier. Consequently, the Zn@Pb&#8208;Ad//MnO2 battery runs stably for 630 and 795&#160;h in 0.2 and 0.1&#160;m H2SO4 electrolytes, respectively, which are &gt;40 times better than that of bare Zn. The as&#8208;prepared A h&#8208;level battery achieves a one&#8208;month calendar life, opening the door to the next generation of high&#8208;durable grid&#8208;scale Zn batteries.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom and Hierarchical&#8208;Pore Aerogel Confinement Strategy for Low&#8208;Platinum Fuel Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom and hierarchical&#8208;pore aerogels are used to support intermetallic ordered Pt alloys as oxygen&#8208;reduction&#8208;reaction catalysts for low Pt fuel cells, which can not only substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass&#8208;transport resistance but also has long&#8208;term durability.








Abstract
Achieving high catalytic performance through the lowest possible content of platinum (Pt) is the key to cost reduction of proton&#8208;exchange&#8208;membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). However, lowering the Pt loading in PEMFCs leads to the high mass&#8208;transport resistance of oxygen originating from the limited active sites, and causes less stability of the catalysts due to Pt size growth after long&#8208;time operation. Herein, Pt&#8211;metal/metal&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel catalysts are designed that substantially reduce oxygen&#8208;related mass transport resistance and have long&#8208;term durability. The tailoring of the Fe&#8211;N&#8211;C aerogel support with hierarchical and interconnecting pores enable a low local oxygen transport resistance (0.18 s cm&#8722;1) for PEMFCs with ultralow Pt loading (50 &#177; 5 &#181;gPt cm&#8722;2). Chemical confinement of Fe&#9472;N sites ensures high stability of the loaded&#8208;Pt both in the processes of synthesis up to 1000 &#176;C and practical application in PEMFCs. The ultralow Pt PEMFC displays a low voltage loss of 8 mV at 0.80 A cm&#8722;2 and unchanged electrochemical surface area after 60 000 cycles of accelerated durability testing. The allying of the hierarchical pores, the aerogel, and the single atoms can fully reflect their structural advantages and expand the understanding for the synthesis of advanced fuel cell PEMFCs catalysts.

         <title>Atomically Unraveling the Structural Evolution of Surfaces and Interfaces in Metal Halide Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic imaging of bulk and local structures of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs) by integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is reported. Particularly, the changes in the surface and interface under various external conditions are revealed. The density functional theory calculations are also carried out to explain the relationship between structure and property of CsPbI3 QDs.








Abstract
Revealing the local structural change of metal halide perovskites (MHPs) induced by external conditions is important to understand its performance and stability in optoelectronic applications. However, previous studies on the properties and structures of MHPs are usually limited by the spatial resolution of the probe, and it is still challenging to obtain its atomic structural information in real space. In this work, the integrated differential&#8208;phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy is applied to the low&#8208;dose imaging of CsPbI3 quantum dots (QDs). In particular, the local structures in QDs, such as surfaces and interfaces, can be atomically resolved. Then, the structural evolution of CsPbI3 QDs under various external conditions can be unraveled during in situ heating or ex situ treatments, where it lose cubic shapes and fuse to larger particles. The changes in surfaces and interfaces with missing Cs ions and PbI6 octahedrons can be semi&#8208;quantitatively studied by profile analysis and bond&#8208;length measurement in images. Finally, density functional theory calculations are performed to illustrate the properties and stabilities of the different structures that are observed. These results provide atomic&#8208;scale insights into the structural evolution of QDs, which is of great importance to modify the performance of perovskite materials and devices.

         <title>Epoxy Adhesives with Reversible Hardeners: Controllable Thermal Debonding in Bulk and at Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new class of on&#8208;demand debondable epoxy adhesives showing fast debonding, while staying stable until high temperatures, is reported. In this context, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents are synthesized and their versatility is demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to functionalized surfaces.








Abstract
On&#8208;demand adhesive dismantling has the potential to improve multimaterial product recycling, but its implementation has been hampered by a critical trade&#8208;off between strong bonding and easy debonding. As a result, the temperature range in which these temporary adhesives can be used is relatively limited. Here, a new class of dynamic epoxy resins is reported that significantly extends this upper temperature limit and still achieves fast debonding. Specifically, two types of dynamic polyamidoamine curing agents for epoxy hardening are&#160;developed, being polysuccinamides (PSA) and polyglutaramides (PGA). As the dynamic debonding/rebonding process of PSA and especially PGA linkages is more thermally demanding and at the same time more thermally robust than previously reported dynamic covalent systems, the resulting materials can be triggered at high temperatures, and at the same time remain bonded over a wide temperature range. The versatility of the PSA and PGA dynamic adhesive curing system is&#160;demonstrated in classical bulk adhesive formulations, as well as in dynamic covalent linking to a PSA&#8208; or PGA&#8208;functionalized surface. As a result, an attractive drop&#8208;in strategy is&#160;achieved for producing debondable and rebondable epoxy adhesives, with high complementarity to existing adhesive resin technologies and applicable in an industrially relevant temperature window.

         <title>Structure Design of Soft Magnetic Materials Using Electron&#8208;Beam&#8208;Based Additive Manufacturing</title>

Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) toroidal cores with tailored structures fabricated by electron beam powder bed fusion using specifically developed hatching strategies (i.e., radial hatching and circle hatching) show promising magnetic properties (i.e., low power losses&#160;and high maximum magnetic flux density), outperforming some soft magnetic materials produced by conventional techniques and laser powder bed fusion.








Abstract
Fe93.5Si6.5 (wt%) soft magnetic materials in toroidal shape are additively manufactured by means of electron beam powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;EB). Different hatching strategies are applied to realize specific patterns of molten material alternating with non&#8208;molten powder particles. The specimens produced using different hatching strategies show identical relative densities but various structural features resulting in different magnetic properties. The magnetic performance of the specimens is characterized by determining hysteresis loops (B&#8211;H curves), power losses, and maximum magnetic flux density at frequencies between 50 and 1000&#160;Hz. At constant mass, the different structures induced by using various hatching strategies have a strong influence on the hysteresis losses. These losses can be significantly reduced by applying a targeted structure design. The modified specimens show superior magnetic properties at sub&#8208;kHz compared to some soft magnetic materials fabricated by means of conventional methods and laser powder bed fusion (PBF&#8208;L).

         <title>Carbonization&#8208;Temperature&#8208;Dependent Electrical Properties of Carbon Nanofibers&#8212;From Nanoscale to Macroscale</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microscopic electrical analysis of carbon nanofiber (CNF) networks reveals a homogeneous current distribution. However, high&#8208;resolution analysis of individual fibers exhibits heterogeneities. A significant CNF surface fraction is highly resistive, representing a severe limitation for the overall conductivity. The conductive surface domains of individual fibers increase with raising carbonization temperature. Microscopic and macroscopic electrical behavior correlates strongly.








Abstract
An exact understanding of the conductivity of individual fibers and their networks is crucial to tailor the overall macroscopic properties of polyacrylonitrile (PAN)&#8208;based carbon nanofibers (CNFs). Therefore, microelectrical properties of CNF networks and nanoelectrical properties of individual CNFs, carbonized at temperatures from 600 to 1000 &#176;C, are studied by means of conductive atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM). At the microscale, the CNF networks show good electrical interconnections enabling a homogeneously distributed current flow. The network's homogeneity is underlined by the strong correlation of macroscopic conductivities, determined by the four&#8208;point&#8208;method, and microscopic results. Both, microscopic and macroscopic electrical properties, solely depend on the carbonization temperature and the exact resulting fiber structure. Strikingly, nanoscale high&#8208;resolution current maps of individual CNFs reveal a large highly resistive surface fraction, representing a clear limitation. Highly resistive surface domains are either attributed to disordered highly resistive carbon structures at the surface or the absence of electron percolation paths in the bulk volume. With increased carbonization temperature, the conductive surface domains grow in size resulting in a higher conductivity. This work contributes to existing microstructural models of CNFs by extending them by electrical properties, especially electron percolation paths.

         <title>Periodic and Aperiodic NiFe Nanomagnet/Ferrimagnet Hybrid Structures for 2D Magnon Steering and Interferometry with High Extinction Ratio</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Periodic and aperiodic NiFe nanopillars with engineered resonances excite magnons down to 49 nm wavelength in underlying yttrium iron garnet when irradiated by GHz signals. Multidirectional steering and interferometry of coherently scattered magnons between three coplanar waveguides provide record extinction ratios over macroscopic distances. The properties are key to establish efficient magnon&#8208;based computing and nanoscale neural networks.








Abstract
Magnons, quanta of spin waves, are known to enable information processing with low power consumption at the nanoscale. So far, however, experimentally realized half&#8208;adders, wave&#8208;logic, and binary output operations are based on few &#181;m&#8208;long spin waves and restricted to one spatial direction. Here, magnons with wavelengths &#955; down to 50 nm in ferrimagnetic Y3Fe5O12 below 2D lattices of periodic and aperiodic ferromagnetic nanopillars are explored. Due to their high rotational symmetries and engineered magnetic resonances, the lattices allow short&#8208;wave magnons to propagate in arbitrarily chosen on&#8208;chip directions when excited by conventional coplanar waveguides. Performing interferometry with magnons over macroscopic distances of 350 &#215; &#955; without loss of coherency, unprecedentedly high extinction ratios of up to 26 (&#177;8) dB [31 (&#177;2) dB] for a binary 1/0 output operation at &#955; = 69&#160;nm (&#955; = 154&#160;nm) are achieved in this work. The reported findings and design criteria for 2D magnon interferometry are particularly important in view of the realization of complex neuronal networks recently proposed for interfering spin waves underneath&#160;nanomagnets.

         <title>A &#960;&#8208;Bridge Spacer Embedded Electron Donor&#8211;Acceptor Polymer for Flexible Electrochromic Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

A &#8220;&#960;&#8208;bridge spacer&#8221;&#8208;embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with Zn2+&#8211;ion&#8208;conducting gel electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible Zn&#8211;ion batteries to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &#960;&#8208;bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through the charging&#8211;discharging cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity.








Abstract
Zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) have drawn much attention for next&#8208;generation energy storage for smart and wearable electronics due to their high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric energy capacities, safety from explosive hazards, and cost&#8208;effectiveness.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zinc&#8211;ion batteries (ZIBs) have drawn much attention for next-generation energy storage for smart and wearable electronics due to their high theoretical gravimetric/volumetric energy capacities, safety from explosive hazards, and cost-effectiveness. However, current state-of-the-art ZIBs lack the energy capacity necessary to facilitate smart functionalities for intelligent electronics. In this work, a &#8220;&lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bridge spacer&#8221;-embedded electron donor&#8211;acceptor polymer cathode combined with a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#8211;ion-conducting electrolyte is proposed for a smart and flexible ZIB to provide high electrochromic&#8211;electrochemical performances. The &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bridge spacer endows the polymeric skeleton with improved physical ion accessibility and sensitive charge transfer through&#160;the cycles, providing extremely stable cyclability with high specific capacity (110 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) at very fast rates (8 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and large coloration efficiency (79.8 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) under severe mechanical deformation over a long period. These results are markedly outstanding compared to the topological analogue without the &lt;i&gt;&#960;&lt;/i&gt;-bridge spacer (80 mAh&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at current density of 8 A&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, 63.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;C&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;).

         <title>Surface Restructuring of Zeolite&#8208;Encapsulated Halide Perovskite to Activate Lattice Oxygen Oxidation for Water Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
MAPbX3 nanocrystals confined in zeolite are the first application to efficient oxygen electrocatalysis in aqueous solution via host&#8211;guest assembly. The absence of phase segregation and halide migration in halide perovskite MAPbBr3 results in markedly improved diffusion of OH&#8722; ions and ultimately leads to the optimal OER activity of MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite.








Abstract
Metal&#8208;halide perovskites possess great potential for electrochemical water splitting that has not been realized due to their intolerance to water. Here, methylammonium lead halide perovskites (MAPbX3) are used to electrocatalyze water oxidation in aqueous electrolytes by creating MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 host&#8211;guest composites. Due to the protective feature of the zeolite matrix, halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) confined in aluminophosphate AlPO&#8208;5 zeolites achieve an excellent stability in water. The resultant electrocatalyst undergoes dynamic surface restructuring during the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) with the formation of an edge&#8208;sharing &#945;&#8208;PbO2 active layer. The existence of charge&#8208;transfer interactions at the MAPbX3/&#945;&#8208;PbO2 interface significantly modulates the surface electron density of the &#945;&#8208;PbO2 and optimizes the adsorption free energy of oxygen&#8208;containing intermediate species. Furthermore, the soft&#8208;lattice nature of halide perovskites enables more facile triggering of lattice&#8208;oxygen oxidation of nanostructured &#945;&#8208;PbO2, exhibiting pH&#8208;dependent OER activity and non&#8208;concerted proton&#8208;electron transfer for MAPbX3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite. As a result, the developed MAPbBr3@AlPO&#8208;5 composite manifests an ultralow overpotential of 233&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 in 1&#160;m KOH. These findings offer facile access to halide perovskite applied to water electrolysis with enhanced intrinsic activity, providing a new paradigm for designing high&#8208;efficiency OER electrocatalysts.

         <title>Supramolecular Photothermal Cascade Nano&#8208;Reactor Enables Photothermal Effect, Cascade Reaction, and In Situ Hydrogelation for Biofilm&#8208;Associated Tooth&#8208;Extraction Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A supramolecular photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor is constructed through a facile and efficient strategy. The supramolecular photothermal cascade reactor can realize synergistic antibacterial therapy. Moreover, combined with the process of hydrogelation in situ initiated by the cascade reaction, the supramolecular photothermal cascade reaction system is applied to treat infection in tooth&#8208;extraction wounds, significantly promoting the wound healing process.








Abstract
Due to the emergence of drug resistance in bacteria and biofilm protection, achieving a satisfactory therapeutic effect for bacteria&#8208;infected open wounds with conventional measures is problematic. Here, a photothermal cascade nano&#8208;reactor (CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+) is constructed through a supramolecular strategy through hydrogen bonding and coordination interactions between chitosan&#8208;modified palladium nano&#8208;cube (CPNC), glucose oxidase (GOx), and ferrous iron (Fe2+). CPNC@GOx&#8208;Fe2+ exhibits excellent photothermal effects and powers the GOx&#8208;assisted cascade reaction to generate hydroxyl radicals, enabling photothermal and chemodynamic combination therapy against bacteria and biofilms. Further proteomics, metabolomics, and all&#8208;atom simulation results indicate that the damage of the hydroxyl radical to the function and structure of the cell membrane and the thermal effect enhance the fluidity and inhomogeneity of the bacterial cell membrane, resulting in the synergistic antibacterial effect. In the biofilm&#8208;associated tooth extraction wound model, the hydroxyl radical generated from the cascade reaction process can initiate the radical polymerization process to form a hydrogel in situ for wound protection. In vivo experiments confirm that synergistic antibacterial and wound protection can accelerate the healing of infected tooth&#8208;extraction wounds without affecting the oral commensal microbiota. This study provides a way to propose a multifunctional supramolecular system for the treatment of open wound infection.

         <title>Video&#8208;Rate Switching of High&#8208;Reflectivity Hybrid Cavities Spanning All Primary Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hybrid nanocavities are utilized as tunable color pixels to generate high reflectance (&gt;40%) colors while retaining video refresh rates and energy consumption far below all existing display technologies.








Abstract
Dynamically tunable reflective structural colors are attractive for reflective displays (electronic paper). However, it is challenging to tune a thin layer of structural color across the full red&#8211;green&#8211;blue (RGB) basis set of colors at video rates and with long&#8208;term stability. In this work, this is achieved through a hybrid cavity built from metal&#8211;insulator&#8211;metal (MIM) &#8220;nanocaves&#8221; and an electrochromic polymer (PProDOTMe2). The reflective colors are modulated by electrochemically doping/dedoping the polymer. Compared with traditional subpixel&#8208;based systems, this hybrid structure provides high reflectivity (&gt;40%) due to its &#8220;monopixel&#8221; nature and switches at video rates. The polymer bistability helps deliver ultralow power consumption (&#8776;2.5&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2) for video display applications and negligible consumption (&#8776;3&#160;&#181;W&#160;cm&#8722;2) for static images, compatible with fully photovoltaic powering. In addition, the color uniformity of the hybrid material is excellent (over cm&#8722;2) and the scalable fabrication enables large&#8208;area production.

A first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind multifunctional ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm spherical GNP monomers, the GNCs provides redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrasts in the near&#8208;infrared (NIR) window which is highly desired by optical imaging modalities such as photoacoustic (PA) imaging and optical coherence tomography (OCT). After disassembly, the GNCs turn back into ultraminiature GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing them to be excreted via urine instead of being trapped in the liver and spleen. Renally clearable ultraminiature GNCs facilitate long&#8208;term multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization in vivo.








Abstract
Currently, available gold nanoparticles (GNPs) typically accumulate in the liver and spleen, leading to concerns for their long&#8208;term biosafety. To address this long&#8208;standing problem, ultraminiature chain&#8208;like gold nanoparticle clusters (GNCs) are developed. Via self&#8208;assembly of 7&#8211;8&#160;nm GNP monomers, GNCs provide redshifted optical absorption and scattering contrast in the near&#8208;infrared window. After disassembly, GNCs turn back to GNPs with a size smaller than the renal glomerular filtration size cutoff, allowing their&#160;excretion via urine. A one&#8208;month longitudinal study in a rabbit eye model demonstrates that GNCs facilitate multimodal molecular imaging of choroidal neovascularization (CNV)&#160;in vivo, non&#8208;invasively, with excellent sensitivity and spatial resolution. GNCs targeting &#945;v&#946;3&#160;integrins enhance photoacoustic and optical coherence tomography (OCT) signals from CNV by 25.3&#8208;fold and 150%, respectively. With excellent biosafety and biocompatibility demonstrated,&#160;GNCs render a first&#8208;of&#8208;its&#8208;kind nanoplatform for biomedical imaging.

         <title>NiSi: A New Venue for Antiferromagnetic Spintronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>The discovery of high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in NiSi with TN &#10878; 700 K is reported. The antiferromagnetism is accompanied by a small uncompensated ferromagnetic component, which can be independently tuned by a small magnetic field, resulting in a one&#8208;step magnetic switching transition. Thus, a new venue for spintronics research is envisaged in this technologically important material.








Abstract
Envisaging antiferromagnetic spintronics pivots on two key criteria of high transition temperature and tuning of underlying magnetic order using straightforward application of magnetic field or electric current. Here, it is shown that NiSi metal can provide suitable new platform in this quest. First, the study unveils high&#8208;temperature antiferromagnetism in single&#8208;crystal NiSi with N&#233;el temperature, TN &#10878; 700 K. Antiferromagnetic order in NiSi is accompanied by non&#8208;centrosymmetric magnetic character with small ferromagnetic component in the a&#8211;c plane. Second, it is found that NiSi manifests distinct magnetic and electronic hysteresis responses to field applications due to the disparity in two moment directions. While magnetic hysteresis is characterized by one&#8208;step switching between ferromagnetic states of uncompensated moment, electronic behavior is ascribed to metamagnetic switching phenomena between non&#8208;collinear spin configurations. Importantly, the switching behaviors persist to high temperature. The properties underscore the importance of NiSi in the pursuit of antiferromagnetic&#160;spintronics.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring Crystal Orientation and Passivating Surface Defects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple solution&#8208;processable passivator is introduced on the top surface of low&#8208;dimensional 2D perovskites. This passivator induces a vertical crystal orientation and simultaneously passivates the defects on the perovskites, leading to efficient charge transport with reduced recombination loss in the photoactive materials. The champion device exhibits a power conversion efficiency of 20.05% with negligible hysteresis and superior operational stability.








Abstract
Solar cells (PSCs) with quasi&#8208;2D Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper perovskites (RPP) exhibit greater environmental stability than 3D perovskites; however, the low power conversion efficiency (PCE) caused by anisotropic crystal orientations and defect sites in the bulk RPP materials limit future commercialization. Herein, a simple post&#8211;treatment is reported for the top surfaces of RPP thin films (RPP composition of PEA2MA4Pb5I16 &lt;n&gt; = 5) in which zwitterionic n&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl&#8208;&#945;&#8208;phenylnitrone (PBN) is used as the passivation material. The PBN molecules passivate the surface and grain boundary defects in the RPP and simultaneously induce vertical direction crystal orientations of the RPPs, which lead to efficient charge transport in the RPP photoactive materials. With this surface engineering methodology, the optimized devices exhibit a remarkably enhanced PCE of 20.05% as compared with the devices without PBN (&#8776;17.53%) and excellent long&#8208;term operational stability with 88% retention of the initial PCE under continuous 1&#8208;sun irradiation for over 1000&#160;h. The proposed passivation strategy provides new insights into the development of efficient and stable RPP&#8208;based PSCs.

         <title>Post&#8208;Maturation Reinforcement of 3D&#8208;Printed Vascularized Cardiac Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method for reinforcing fully cellularized tissue is shown. Vascularized cardiac tissues are printed. Following tissue maturation, a biocompatible, tissue&#8208;penetrating small&#8208;molecule is deployed to generate significant improvement in the tissue's mechanical properties.








Abstract
Despite advances in biomaterials engineering, a large gap remains between the weak mechanical properties that can be achieved with natural materials and the strength of synthetic materials. Here, a method is presented for reinforcing an engineered cardiac tissue fabricated from differentiated induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and an extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;based hydrogel in a manner that is fully biocompatible. The reinforcement occurs as a post&#8208;fabrication step, which allows for the use of 3D&#8208;printing technology to generate thick, fully cellularized, and vascularized cardiac tissues. After tissue assembly and during the maturation process in a soft hydrogel, a small, tissue&#8208;penetrating reinforcer is deployed, leading to a significant increase in the tissue's mechanical properties. The tissue's robustness is demonstrated by injecting the tissue in a simulated minimally invasive procedure and showing that the tissue is functional and undamaged at the nano&#8208;, micro&#8208;, and macroscales.

         <title>Lubricated Interfaces Enabling Simultaneous Pulsatile and Continuous Chemical Release Modes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The loading of chemicals in a porous polymeric coating prior to lubrication leads to a diffusion&#8208;based continuous release of chemicals, whereas the loading of dissolved water&#8208;soluble chemicals that disperse in the lubricated liquid crystals in the form of micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets gives rise to a pulsatile release triggered by a liquid crystal phase transition.








Abstract
The release of chemicals following either pulsatile or continuous release modes is important for various potential applications, including programmed chemical reactions, mechanical actuation, and treatments of various diseases. However, the simultaneous application of both modes in a single material system has been challenging. Here, two chemical loading methods are reported in a liquid&#8208;crystal&#8208;infused porous surface (LCIPS) that enables both a pulsatile and continuous release of chemicals simultaneously. Specifically, chemicals loaded in the porous substrate exhibit a liquid crystal (LC) mesophase&#8208;dependent continuous release, whereas the chemicals dissolved in micrometer&#8208;sized aqueous droplets dispersed in the LC surface follow a pulsatile release activated by a phase transition. Moreover, the loading method of distinct molecules can be controlled to program their release mode. Finally, the pulsatile and continuous release of two distinct bioactive small molecules, tetracycline and dexamethasone, are demonstrated which display antibacterial and immunomodulatory activities for applications such as chronic wound healing and biomedical implant coating.

         <title>Low&#8208;Power and Field&#8208;Free Perpendicular Magnetic Memory Driven by Topological Insulators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
With the assistance of a small STT current across the MTJ stack during SOT, field&#8208;free deterministic SOT switching is realized, and the critical switching current density of SOT decreases with increasing the STT current density. TI&#8208;pMTJ devices with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy have much higher thermal stability and much lower switching current density, to realize SOT&#8208;MRAM applications.








Abstract
Giant spin&#8211;orbit torque (SOT) from topological insulators (TIs) has great potential for low&#8208;power SOT&#8208;driven magnetic random&#8208;access memory (SOT&#8208;MRAM). In this work, a functional 3&#8208;terminal SOT&#8208;MRAM device is demonstrated by integrating the TI [(BiSb)2Te3] with perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions (pMTJs), where the tunneling magnetoresistance is employed for the effective reading method. An ultralow switching current density of 1.5 &#215; 105&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 is achieved in the TI&#8208;pMTJ device at room temperature, which is 1&#8211;2 orders of magnitude lower than that in conventional heavy&#8211;metals&#8208;based systems, due to the high SOT efficiency &#952;SH = 1.16 of (BiSb)2Te3. Furthermore, all&#8208;electrical field&#8208;free writing is realized by the synergistic effect of a small spin&#8208;transfer torque current during the SOT. The thermal stability factor (&#916; = 66) shows the high retention time (&gt;10 years) of the TI&#8208;pMTJ device. This work sheds light to the future low&#8208;power, high&#8208;density, and high&#8208;endurance/retention magnetic memory technology based on quantum materials.

         <title>Molybdenum Disulfide Nanoribbons with Enhanced Edge Nonlinear Response and Photoresponsivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors are successfully demonstrated. The MoS2 nanoribbons grown using a dual pulsed laser deposition&#8208;chemical vapor deposition approach exhibit single&#8208;layer edges with enhanced nonlinear optical response and photoluminescence emission. The photoresponsivity of the nano&#8208;photodetector device reaches a value of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at visible wavelengths.








Abstract
MoS2 nanoribbons have attracted increased interest due to their properties, which can be tailored by tuning their dimensions. Herein, the growth of MoS2 nanoribbons and triangular crystals formed by the reaction between films of MoOx (2&lt;x&lt;3)&#160;grown by pulsed laser deposition and NaF in a sulfur&#8208;rich environment is demonstrated. The nanoribbons can reach up to 10&#160;&#181;m in length, and feature single&#8208;layer&#160;edges, forming a monolayer&#8211;multilayer junction enabled by the lateral modulation in thickness. The single&#8208;layer edges show a pronounced second harmonic generation due to the symmetry breaking, in contrast to the centrosymmetric multilayer structure, which is unsusceptible to the second&#8208;order nonlinear process. A splitting of the Raman spectra is observed in MoS2 nanoribbons arising from distinct contributions from the single&#8211;layer edges and multilayer core. Nanoscale imaging reveals a blue&#8208;shifted exciton emission of the monolayer edge compared to the isolated MoS2 monolayers due to built&#8208;in local strain and disorder. We&#160;further report on an ultrasensitive photodetector made of a single MoS2 nanoribbon with a responsivity of 8.72&#160;&#215;&#160;102&#160;A&#160;W&#8722;1 at 532&#160;nm, among the highest reported up&#8208;to&#8208;date for single&#8208;nanoribbon photodetectors. These findings can inspire the design of MoS2 semiconductors with tunable geometries for efficient optoelectronic devices.

         <title>Carbon Dots with Blue&#8208;to&#8208;Near&#8208;Infrared Lasing for Colorful Speckle&#8208;Free Laser Imaging and Dynamical Holographic Display</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tunable lasers span 238&#160;nm across from blue to near&#8208;infrared region are realized from full&#8208;color carbon dots (FC&#8208;CDs) in a mirrorless system. The lasers of the FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors, considerable gain coefficients, and better stability than common commercial organic dyes. Finally, high&#8208;quality, colorful speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display are successfully demonstrated using these lasers as light sources.








Abstract
As a new solution&#8208;processable laser material, carbon dots (CDs) offer advantages of non&#8208;toxicity, low&#8208;cost, and high&#8208;stability, which are conducive to the sustainable development of miniaturized lasers. Full&#8208;color CDs (FC&#8208;CDs) with bright&#8208;blue, green, yellow, red, deep&#8208;red, and near&#8208;infrared (NIR) fluorescence are prepared. Their photoluminescence emission ranges from 431 to 714&#160;nm. The FC&#8208;CDs show narrow full widths at half maximum in the range of 44&#8211;76&#160;nm, with concurrent high radiative transition rates (KR) of 0.54&#8211;1.74 &#215; 108&#160;s&#8722;1; their performance is comparable to that of organic laser dyes, indicating their good gain potential for lasers. Laser pumping of the FC&#8208;CDs gives laser outputs at 467.3, 533.5, 577.4, 616.3, 653.5, and 705.1&#160;nm, spanning from blue to NIR region, and covering 140% of the NTSC color gamut. The FC&#8208;CDs show high Q&#8208;factors (2000&#8211;5500), appreciable gain coefficients (9&#8211;21.5&#160;cm&#8722;1), and better stability (&#8776;100%@4&#8211;7&#160;h) than commercial laser dyes. These excellent properties make them suitable for high&#8208;quality, colorful, speckle&#8208;free laser imaging and dynamic holographic display. The findings will be helpful in promoting the practical applications and development of solution&#8208;processable CD&#8208;based lasers.

         <title>Gradient Cationic Vacancies Enabling Inner&#8208;To&#8208;Outer Tandem Homojunctions: Strong Local Internal Electric Field and Reformed Basic Sites Boosting CO2 Photoreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Gradient cation (W6+) vacancies on the surface of Bi2WO6 nanosheets construct a local intrinsic electric field across the catalyst subsurface, which provides a driving force for the separation of photogenerated carriers. The W6+ vacancies also change the basic sites on the surface and the type of CO2 adsorption, thus lowering the barrier for the formation of the essential intermediate *COOH in the CO2 conversion process and ultimately improving the CO2 reduction ability.








Abstract
The slow charge dynamics and large activation energy of CO2 severely hinder the efficiency of CO2 photoreduction. Defect engineering is a well&#8208;established strategy, while the function of common zero&#8208;dimensional defects is always restricted to promoting surface adsorption. In this work, a gradient layer of tungsten vacancies with a thickness of 3&#8211;4&#160;nm is created across Bi2WO6 nanosheets. This gradient layer&#160;enables the formation of an inner&#8208;to&#8208;outer tandem homojunction with an internal electric field, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of photoelectrons from the bulk to the surface. Meanwhile, W vacancies change the coordination environment around O and W atoms, leading to an alteration in the basic sites and the mode of CO2 adsorption from weak/strong adsorption to moderate adsorption, which ultimately decreases the formation barrier of the key intermediate *COOH and facilitates the conversion thermodynamics for CO2. Without any cocatalyst and sacrificial reagent, W&#8208;vacant Bi2WO6 shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO2 reduction performance with a CO production rate of 30.62&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1, being one of the best catalysts in similar reaction systems. This study reveals that gradient vacancies as a new type of defect will show huge potential in regulating charge dynamics and catalytic reaction thermodynamics.

&lt;p&gt;The slow charge dynamics and large activation energy of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; severely hinder the efficiency of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; photoreduction. Defect engineering is a well-established strategy, while the function of common zero-dimensional defects is always restricted to promoting surface adsorption. In this work, a gradient layer of tungsten vacancies with a thickness of 3&#8211;4&#160;nm is created across Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets. This gradient layer&#160;enables the formation of an inner-to-outer tandem homojunction with an internal electric field, which provides a strong driving force for the migration of photoelectrons from the bulk to the surface. Meanwhile, W vacancies change the coordination environment around O and W atoms, leading to an alteration in the basic sites and the mode of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; adsorption from weak/strong adsorption to moderate adsorption, which ultimately decreases the formation barrier of the key intermediate *COOH and facilitates the conversion thermodynamics for CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Without any cocatalyst and sacrificial reagent, W-vacant Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;WO&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; shows an outstanding photocatalytic CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction performance with a CO production rate of 30.62&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;&#160;h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, being one of the best catalysts in similar reaction systems. This study reveals that gradient vacancies as a new type of defect will show huge potential in regulating charge dynamics and catalytic reaction thermodynamics.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Nanoengineered Design of inside&#8208;Heating Hot Nanoreactor Surrounded by Cool Environment for Selective Hydrogenations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multi&#8208;function nanocatalyst, integrating locally inside&#8208;heating, thermal insulation, and high&#8208;dispersed Pt into a whole, induces selective hydrogenations within heat&#8208;constrained nanoreactors (120&#160;&#176;C) surrounded by a cool environment (40&#160;&#176;C). A 20.1&#8208;fold increase in reaction rate is achieved compared to the conventional outside&#8208;in heating. The diffusion of target products into a cool environment ensures the high selectivity (&gt;98%) under high conversion (&#8776;100%).








Abstract
Catalysts with designable intelligent nanostructure may potentially drive the changes in chemical reaction techniques. Herein, a multi&#8208;function integrating nanocatalyst, Pt&#8208;containing magnetic yolk&#8208;shell carbonaceous structure, having catalysis function, microenvironment heating, thermal&#160;insulation, and elevated pressure into a whole is designed, which induces selective hydrogenation within heating&#8208;constrained nanoreactors surrounded by ambient environment.&#160;As a demonstration, carbonyl of &#945;, &#946;&#8208;unsaturated aldehydes/ketones are selectively hydrogenated to unsaturated alcohols with a &gt;98% selectivity at a nearly complete conversion under mild conditions of 40&#160;&#176;C and 3&#160;bar instead of harsh requirements of 120&#160;&#176;C and 30&#160;bar. It is creatively demonstrated that the locally increased temperature and endogenous pressure (estimated as &#8776;120&#160;&#176;C, 9.7&#160;bar) in the nano&#8208;sized space greatly facilitate the reaction kinetics under an alternating magnetic field. The outward&#8208;diffused products to the &#8220;cool environment&#8221; remain thermodynamically stable, avoiding the over&#8208;hydrogenation that often occurs under constantly heated conditions of 120&#160;&#176;C. Regulation of the electronic state of Pt by sulfur doping of carbon allows selective chemical adsorption of the &#63743;C&#63742;O group and consequently leads to selective hydrogenation. It is expected that such a multi&#8208;function integrated catalyst provides an ideal platform for precisely operating a variety of organic liquid&#8208;phase transformations under mild reaction conditions.

         <title>Ferroelectric Modulation in Flexible Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Schottky Direct&#8208;Current Nanogenerator for Capsule&#8208;Like Magnetic Suspension Sensor</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports a flexible and dynamic ferroelectric lead&#8208;free halide perovskite (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction tribovoltaic nanogenerator with high current output (93&#160;&#181;A) at the macroscale. More significantly, a stable and efficient ferroelectricity&#8208;modulated strategy, for the first time, is proposed, which realizes a 15&#8208;fold current enhancement via the electric poling field control.








Abstract
The tribovoltaic nanogenerator (TVNG), a promising semiconductor energy technology, displays outstanding advantages such as low matching impedance and continuous direct&#8208;current output. However, the lack of controllable and stable performance modulation strategies is still a major bottleneck that impedes further practical applications of TVNG. Herein, by leveraging the ferroelectricity&#8208;enhanced mechanism and the control of interfacial energy band bending, a lead&#8208;free perovskite&#8208;based (3,3&#8208;difluorocyclobutylammonium)2CuCl4 ((DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4)/Al Schottky junction TVNG is constructed. The multiaxial ferroelectricity of (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 enables an excellent surface charge modulating capacity, realizing a high work function regulation of &#8776;0.7&#160;eV and over 15&#8208;fold current regulation (from 6 to 93&#160;&#181;A) via an electrical poling control. The controllable electrical poling leads to elevated work function difference between the Al electrode and (DF&#8208;CBA)2CuCl4 compared to traditional semiconductors and halide perovskites, which creates a stronger built&#8208;in electric field at the Schottky interface to enhance the electrical output. This TVNG device exhibits outstanding flexibility and long&#8208;term stability (&gt;20&#160;000 cycles) that can endure extreme mechanical deformations, and can also be used in a capsule&#8208;like magnetic suspension device capable of detecting vibration and weights of different objects as well as harvesting energy from human motions and water waves.

         <title>Switching Chirality in Arrays of Shape&#8208;Reconfigurable Spindle Microparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Microarrays consisting of individual shape&#8208;changeable microparticles with anisotropic and uniform&#8208;sized shapes enable symmetry breaking from achiral to chiral (with opposite signs) upon heating or light illumination. Chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains are controllably created. This study will lead to rich structures and novel physics emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology at the light&#8211;matter interface.








Abstract
The giant circular photo&#8208;galvanic effect is realized in chiral metals when illuminated by circularly polarized light. However, the structure itself is not switchable nor is the crystal chirality in the adjacent chiral domains. Here spindle&#8208;shaped liquid crystalline elastomer microparticles that can switch from prolate to spherical to oblate reversibly upon heating above the nematic to isotropic transition temperature are synthesized. When arranged in a honeycomb lattice, the continuous shape change of the microparticles leads to lattice reconfiguration, from a right&#8208;handed chiral state to an achiral one, then to a left&#8208;handed chiral state, without breaking the translational symmetry. Accordingly, the sign of rotation of the polarized light passing through the lattices changes as measured by time&#8208;domain terahertz spectroscopy. Further, it can locally alter the chirality in the adjacent domains using near&#8208;infrared light illumination. The reconfigurable chiral microarrays will allow us to explore non&#8208;trivial symmetry&#8208;protected transport modes of topological lattices at the light&#8211;matter interface. Specifically, the ability to controllably create chiral states at the boundary of the achiral/chiral domains will lead to rich structures emerging from the interplay of symmetry and topology.

         <title>Interface Modification for Efficient and Stable Inverted Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The formation of Pb&#8211;S bonds between perovskite and 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole appreciably reduces surface trap and improves interfacial energy level alignment. The open circuit voltage of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 120 mV, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 20.6%, along with improved ambient stability.








Abstract
Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs is significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx films with 2&#8208;mercapto&#8208;1&#8208;methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb2+ from perovskite by forming Pb&#8211;S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron&#8208;transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open&#8208;circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm2 area and 17.3% for 1 cm2 area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. The work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.

The open circuit voltage of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells is enhanced by 120 mV, yielding a power conversion efficiency of 20.6%, along with improved ambient stability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Due to their excellent thermal stability and ideal bandgap, metal halide inorganic perovskite based solar cells (PSCs) with inverted structure are considered as an excellent choice for perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs) still lags far behind that of conventional n&#8211;i&#8211;p PSCs due to interfacial energy level mismatch and high nonradiative charge recombination. Herein, the performance of inverted PSCs is significantly improved by interfacial engineering of CsPbI&lt;sub&gt;3&#8722;&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt;Br&lt;i&gt;
   &lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;/i&gt; films with 2-mercapto-1-methylimidazole (MMI). It is found that the mercapto group can preferably react with the undercoordinated Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; from perovskite by forming Pb&#8211;S bonds, which appreciably reduces the surface trap density. Moreover, MMI modification results in a better energy level alignment with the electron-transporting material, promoting carrier transfer and reducing voltage deficit. The above combination results in an open-circuit voltage enhancement by 120&#160;mV, yielding a champion PCE of 20.6% for 0.09 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area and 17.3% for 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area. Furthermore, the ambient, operational and heat stabilities of inorganic PSCs with MMI modification are also greatly improved. The work demonstrates a simple but effective approach for fabricating highly efficient and stable inverted inorganic PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Induction of Bleb Structures in Lipid Nanoparticle Formulations of mRNA Leads to Improved Transfection Potency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. In this work, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs&#160;containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffer, leading to dramatically improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo.








Abstract
The transfection potency of lipid nanoparticle (LNP) mRNA systems is critically dependent on the ionizable cationic lipid component. LNP mRNA systems composed of optimized ionizable lipids often display distinctive mRNA&#8208;rich &#8220;bleb&#8221; structures. Here, it is shown that such structures can also be induced for LNPs containing nominally less active ionizable lipids by formulating them in the presence of high concentrations of pH 4 buffers such as sodium citrate, leading to improved transfection potencies both in vitro and in vivo. Induction of bleb structure and improved potency is dependent on the type of pH 4 buffer employed, with LNP mRNA systems prepared using 300 mm sodium citrate buffer displaying maximum transfection. The improved transfection potencies of LNP mRNA systems displaying bleb structure can be attributed, at least in part, to enhanced integrity of the encapsulated mRNA. It is concluded that enhanced transfection can be achieved by optimizing formulation parameters to improve mRNA stability and that optimization of ionizable lipids to achieve enhanced potency may well lead to improvements in mRNA integrity through formation of the bleb structure rather than enhanced intracellular delivery.

         <title>Epitaxy of a Monocrystalline CsPbBr3&#8211;SrTiO3 Halide&#8211;Oxide Perovskite p&#8211;n Heterojunction with High Stability for Photodetection</title>

         <dc:description>
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion of perovskites. A stable p&#8211;n heterojunction is formed with the epitaxy of p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type SrTiO3 (STO). The combination of vapor&#8208;phase&#8208;deposited monocrystalline CsPbBr3 and STO makes full use of the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and excellent stability of oxide perovskite, opening up a new method for the construction of perovskite heterojunction&#8211;based optoelectronics.








Abstract
Perovskite heterojunctions are essential components of perovskite optoelectronics, but their construction and investigation have been impeded by the instability and severe anion interdiffusion. This work epitaxially deposits p&#8208;type CsPbBr3 on n&#8208;type Nb:SrTiO3 (STO) to construct a functional perovskite heterojunction with high stability. The lattice match allows epitaxial growth of CsPbBr3 to occur over large scale, resulting in a monocrystalline thin film with excellent crystallinity and uniformity. The highly stable STO prevents the anion migration frequently happening in halide perovskites, forming a sharp interface of two perovskite with opposite conduction type, with which a diode is fabricated and a current rectification ratio of 374 is obtained. The diode is able to work as a photodetector with dark current of 2.01 &#215; 10&#8722;12 A at &#8722;1&#160;V and responsivity (R) of 8.26 A W&#8722;1, rendering a detectivity (D*) of 2.98 &#215; 1013 Jones. Owing to the all&#8208;inorganic architecture, effective photoresponse at temperature as high as 150 &#176;C is guaranteed with D* of &#8776;1.52 &#215; 1013 Jones. Combining the unique optoelectrical properties of halide perovskite and the rigidity of oxide perovskite, the epitaxy of CsPbBr3 on n&#8211;type STO opens up a new method to construct functional perovskite heterojunction for optoelectronics.

         <title>Tailored Cysteine&#8208;Derived Molecular Structures toward Efficient and Stable Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>

A brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), is demonstrated to post&#8208;treat CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx perovskite films. The synergistic effects of an energetic electron donor group and multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups in BMBC are purposefully designed to passivate majority of defects. Benefiting from a hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl group in BMBC, the protection against water invasion is thus significantly enhanced. This study provides a useful understanding and rational design regarding the influence of the molecular configuration on the passivation efficacy in inorganic perovskite&#8208;type photovoltaics.








Abstract
Surface&#8211;defect&#8208;triggered non&#8208;radiative charge recombination and poor stability have become the main roadblock to continued improvement in inorganic perovskite solar cells (PSCs). Herein, the main culprits are identified on the inorganic perovskite surface by first&#8208;principles calculations, and to purposefully design a brand&#8208;new passivator, Boc&#8208;S&#8208;4&#8208;methoxy&#8208;benzyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine (BMBC), whose multiple Lewis&#8208;based functional groups (NH&#63743;, S&#63743; and C&#63742;O) to suppress halide vacancies and coordinate with undercoordinated Pb2+ through typical Lewis baseacid reactions. The tailored electron&#8208;donating methoxyl group (CH3O&#8211;) can cause an increased electron density on the benzene ring, which strengthens the interaction with undercoordinated Pb2+ via electrostatic interactions. This BMBC passivation can reduce the surface trap density, enlarge grains, prolong the charge lifetime, and cause a more suitable energy&#8208;level alignment. In addition, the hydrophobic tert&#8208;butyl in butoxycarbonyl (Boc&#8208;) group ensures that BMBC is uniformly covered and prevents harmful aggregation through steric repulsion at the perovskite/hole&#8211;transporting layer (HTL) interface, thus providing a hydrophobic umbrella to resist moisture invasion. Consequently, the combination of the above increases the efficiency of CsPbI3&#8722;xBrx PSC from 18.6% to 21.8%, the highest efficiency for this type of inorganic metal halide PSCs so far, as far as it is known. Moreover, the device exhibits higher environmental and thermal stability.

         <title>BiFeO3 Nanoparticles: The &#8220;Holy&#8208;Grail&#8221; of Piezo&#8208;Photocatalysts?</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly efficient and versatile BiFeO3 nanoparticle piezocatalysts are found to exhibit strong piezocatalytic and synergistic piezo&#8208;photocatalytic effects (100% degradation ratio of Rhodamine B within 5&#160;min) and are embedded into a P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) polymer to design a flexible, stable, and reusable multicatalytic system for wastewater treatment using mechanical forces and sunlight.








Abstract
Recently, piezoelectric&#8208;based catalysis has been demonstrated to be an efficient means and promising alternative to sunlight&#8208;driven photocatalysis, where mechanical vibrations trigger redox reactions. Here, 60&#160;nm&#8208;size BiFeO3 nanoparticles are shown to be very effective for piezo&#8208;degrading Rhodamine B (RhB) model dye with record degradation rate reaching 13&#160;810&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1, and even 41 750&#160;L&#160;mol&#8722;1&#160;min&#8722;1 (i.e., 100% RhB degradation within 5&#160;min) when piezocatalysis is synergistically combined with sunlight photocatalysis. These BiFeO3 piezocatalytic nanoparticles are also demonstrated to be versatile toward several dyes and pharmaceutical pollutants, with over 80% piezo&#8208;decomposition within 120&#160;min. The maintained high piezoelectric coefficient combined with low dielectric constant, high&#8208;elastic modulus, and the nanosized shape make these BiFeO3&#160;nanoparticles extremely efficient piezocatalysts. To avoid subsequent secondary pollution and enable their reusability, the BiFeO3 nanoparticles are further embedded in a polymer P(VDF&#8208;TrFE) matrix. The as&#8208;designed flexible, chemically stable, and recyclable nanocomposites still keep remarkable piezocatalytic and piezo&#8208;photocatalytic performances (i.e., 92% and 100% RhB degradation, respectively, within 20&#160;min). This work opens a new research avenue for BiFeO3 that is the model multiferroic and offers a new platform for water cleaning, as well as other applications such as water splitting, CO2 reduction, or surface purification.

&lt;p&gt;Highly efficient and versatile BiFeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; nanoparticle piezocatalysts are found to exhibit strong piezocatalytic and synergistic piezo-photocatalytic effects (100% degradation ratio of Rhodamine B within 5&#160;min) and are embedded into a P(VDF-TrFE) polymer to design a flexible, stable, and reusable multicatalytic system for wastewater treatment using mechanical forces and sunlight.

         <title>Biomimetic Multicolor&#8208;Separating Photonic Skin using Electrically Stretchable Chiral Photonic Elastomers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimodulus chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) are modulated, and multicolor control with dynamic wavelength change from a single color is realized. Multicolor separation by mechanical stretching or electrical stretching occurs via the exploitation of engineered modulus&#8208;adjusted CPEs. Moreover, stretchable multicolor separation using a mixed array of CPEs is investigated for potential photonic camouflage applications.








Abstract
Structural color can be produced by nanoperiodic dielectric structures using soft materials. Chiral photonic elastomers (CPEs) produced from elastic chiral liquid crystal molecules can self&#8208;organize into a helical nanostructure, and the chiral nanostructural color can be tuned by stretching. However, the ability to control the separation of biomimetic multicolors for practical applications beyond simple uniaxial stretching of single&#8208;colored structures has been limited until now. Here, stretchable CPEs with simultaneous multicolor control, including electrical control, are presented. By engineering the heterogeneous elastic modulus of the CPEs, stretchable and simultaneous multicolor separations from an initially homogeneous color are realized. Electrically stretchable multicolor separation is investigated using a hybrid CPE structure on dielectric elastomer actuators, and multiarrayed color binning and chameleon&#8208;like photonic e&#8208;skin are further developed for device applications. Moreover, multicolor concealed camouflage switching and control of invisible photonic e&#8208;skin are demonstrated. This multicolor control of stretchable photonic systems improves the functionality of various potential photonic applications.

Multicolor Switching
In article number 2302456, Su Seok Choi and co&#8208;workers investigate biomimetic multicolor separation control of mechanochromic switching using electrically stretchable chiral liquid crystal elastomers (CLCEs). With advanced engineering of electrically stretchable CLCEs, various multicolor switching devices are experimentally verified. A chameleon&#8208;like synthetic multicolor photonic skin control is also reported, with invisibility switching using electrically stretchable CLCEs. The conceived multicolor CLCEs are also validated with camouflage information control using color pixels reconfiguration and invisibility switching.

Tissue Bioprinting
In article number 2302229, Tal Dvir and co&#8208;workers demonstrate a biocompatible method for reinforcing engineered tissue post&#8208;fabrication. The technique enables 3D bioprinting of soft tissue and gives the cells time to establish intercellular communications before the tissue's mechanical properties are significantly improved by the reinforcement protocol. In the work, thick, vascularized cardiac tissues are enhanced to the point of injectability.

         <title>Efficient and Stable Perovskite Solar Cells by Tailoring of Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in&#8208;depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large&#8208;scale mini&#8208;modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco&#8208;friendly PSCs.

&lt;p&gt;The stability of perovskite solar cells is a significant challenge for commercialization due to the inherent instability of the perovskite material and the interface defects between different layers in the device. Tailoring the interfaces in perovskite solar cells can enhance the device's efficiency and stability. This review discusses the theory of interface improvement and various interface materials for efficient, stable perovskite solar cells.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interface tailoring is crucial for the efficiency and stability of Perovskite Solar Cells (PSCs). The reported interface engineering primarily focuses on the energy level turning and trap state passivation to improve the photovoltaic performance of PSCs. In this review, molecule modifications are classified according to the basics of electron transfer mechanisms for the interface tailoring of materials. An in-depth analysis of energy level modification and trap passivation, as well as the universal Density Functional Theory (DFT) method employed in interface tailoring. In addition, strategies to address environmental protection and large-scale mini-modules fabrication by interface engineering are also discussed. This review can guide the researchers in understanding interface engineering to design interface materials for efficient, stable, and eco-friendly PSCs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <dc:description>
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) are seen as potentially promising candidates for novel light&#8208;emission applications, owing to their unique characteristics. This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the development of 2D TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting devices and highlights the remaining challenges.








Abstract
2D monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) show great promise for the development of next&#8208;generation light&#8208;emitting devices owing to their unique electronic and optoelectronic properties. The dangling&#8208;bond&#8208;free surface and direct&#8208;bandgap structure of monolayer TMDCs allow for near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum efficiencies. The excellent mechanical and optical characteristics of 2D TMDCs offer great potential to fabricate TMDC&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) featuring good flexibility and transparency. Great progress has been made in the fabrication of bright and efficient LEDs with varying device structures. In this review, the aim is to provide a comprehensive summary of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art progress made in the construction of bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs. After a brief introduction to the research background, the preparation of 2D TMDCs used for LEDs is briefly discussed. The requirements and the corresponding challenges to achieve bright and efficient LEDs based on 2D TMDCs are introduced. Thereafter, various strategies to enhance the brightness of monolayer 2D TMDCs are described. Following that, the carrier&#8208;injection schemes enabling bright and efficient TMDC&#8208;based LEDs along with the device performance are summarized. Finally, the challenges and future prospects regarding the accomplishment of TMDC&#8208;LEDs with ultimate brightness and efficiency are discussed.

         <title>Microenvironment Engineering of Single/Dual&#8208;Atom Catalysts for Electrocatalytic Application</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
Recent advances in the microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs/DACs) for electrocatalytic applications are systematically reviewed. The microenvironment regulation principles of carbon&#8208;based single/dual&#8208;atom sites, corresponding structure&#8211;performance relationships with reaction mechanism study over several electrochemical processes for SACs and DACs are thoroughly discussed. This review aims to provide an inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts in electrocatalysis field.








Abstract
Single/dual&#8208;metal atoms supported on carbon matrix can be modulated by coordination structure and neighboring active sites. Precisely designing the geometric and electronic structure and uncovering the structure&#8211;property relationships of single/dual&#8208;metal atoms confront with grand challenges. Herein, this review summarizes the latest progress in microenvironment engineering of single/dual&#8208;atom active sites via a comprehensive comparison of single&#8208;atom catalyst (SACs) and dual&#8208;atom catalysts (DACs) in term of design principles, modulation strategy, and theoretical understanding of structure&#8211;performance correlations. Subsequently, recent advances in several typical electrocatalysis process are discussed to get general understanding of the reaction mechanisms on finely&#8208;tuned SACs and DACs. Finally, full&#8208;scaled summaries of the challenges and prospects are given for microenvironment engineering of SACs and DACs. This review will provide new inspiration on the development of atomically dispersed catalysts for electrocatalytic application.

         <title>Reconfiguring Hard Carbons with Emerging Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries: A Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 35, Issue 31, August 3, 2023. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights three critical structural features of hard carbons for practical use in sodium&#8208;ion batteries, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores. The impact of these structural features upon sodium storage is systematically discussed and an ideal configuration, namely sieving carbons with tightened pore entrance and enlarged pore body, is finally proposed for superior sodium storage.








Abstract
Hard carbons, an important category of amorphous carbons, are non&#8208;graphitizable and are widely accepted as the most promising anode materials for emerging sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs)&#65292; because of their changeable low&#8208;potential charge/discharge plateaus. However, their microstructures are not fixed and are difficult to accurately demonstrate as graphites do. The successful use of hard carbons in SIBs revives the interest to clearly picture their complicated microstructures that are in close relevance to sodium storage. In this review, the past definitions and structural models of hard carbons are revisited first, and a renewed understanding of their sodium storage is presented. Three critical structural features are highlighted for hard carbons, namely crystallites, defects, and nanopores, which are directly responsible for the presence of the low&#8208;potential plateaus and their reversible extension. The impact of these structural features upon the sodium storage is then deeply discussed and sieving carbons is finally proposed as an ideal configuration of carbon anode for superhigh sodium storage. This review is expected to offer a clear picture of hard carbons, and help realize a truly rational design of high&#8208;capacity carbon anodes, driving the industrialization of SIBs, and more promisingly open up a window for exploring their possible new uses.

A comprehensive review is proposed on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four ultrasound&#8208;related biological applications and disease treatments. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are also conducted, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT).








Abstract
Nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented ultrasound (US) medicine is a unique area of interdisciplinary research that focuses on designing and engineering functional nanosystems to address the challenging issues in US&#8208;based biomedicine, overcoming the shortcomings of traditional microbubbles and optimizing the design of contrast and sonosensitive agents. The single&#8208;faceted summary of available US&#8208;related therapies is still a significant drawback. Here, The proposal of a comprehensive review on the recent advances of sonosensitive nanomaterials in advancing four US&#8208;related biological applications and disease theranostics is aimed. In addition to the mostly explored nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/augmented sonodynamic therapy (SDT), the summary and discussion of other sono&#8208;therapies and progresses/achievements are relatively lacking, including sonomechanical therapy (SMT), sonopiezoelectric therapy (SPT), and sonothermal therapy (STT). The design concepts of the specific sono&#8208;therapies based on nanomedicines are initially introduced. Furthermore, the representative paradigms for nanomedicine&#8208;enabled/enhanced US therapies are elaborated according to therapeutic principles and diversity. This review provides an updated and comprehensive review of the field of nanoultrasonic biomedicine, and comprehensively discusses the progress of versatile ultrasonic disease treatments. Finally, the deep discussion on the facing challenges and prospects is expected to promote the emergence and establishment of a new branch of US biomedicine through the rational combination of nanomedicine and US clinical biomedicine.

Abstract
The journey of ceramics in medicine has been synchronized with an evolution from the first generation&#8212;alumina, zirconia, etc.&#8212;to the third &#8212;3D scaffolds. There is an up&#8208;and&#8208;coming member called oxygen&#8208;deficient or colored bioceramics, which have recently found their way through biomedical applications. The oxygen vacancy steers the light absorption toward visible and near infrared regions, making the colored bioceramics multifunctional&#8212;therapeutic, diagnostic, and regenerative. Oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics are capable of turning light into heat and reactive oxygen species for photothermal and photodynamic therapies, respectively, and concomitantly yield infrared and photoacoustic images. Different types of oxygen&#8208;deficient bioceramics have been recently developed through various synthesis routes. Some of them like TiO2&#8722;x, MoO3&#8722;x, and WOx have been more investigated for biomedical applications, whereas the rest have yet to be scrutinized. The most prominent advantage of these bioceramics over the other biomaterials is their multifunctionality endowed with a change in the microstructure. There are some challenges ahead of this category discussed at the end of the present review. By shedding light on this recently born bioceramics subcategory, it is believed that the field will undergo a big step further as these platforms are naturally multifunctional.

         <title>The Oxygen Evolution Reaction Drives Passivity Breakdown for Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo&#160;Alloys</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Passivity breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys upon anodic polarization is traditionally believed to be caused by oxidation of stable Cr3+ oxide to soluble Cr6+ species leading to fast metal dissolution. By using multimodal in situ synchrotron measurements of highly alloyed Ni&#8211;base alloys, a new passivity breakdown mechanism is reported, namely oxygen evolution reaction (OER) induced metal dissolution occurring at lower anodic potentials.








Abstract
Corrosion is the main factor limiting the lifetime of metallic materials, and a fundamental understanding of the governing mechanism and surface processes is difficult to achieve since the thin oxide films at the metal&#8211;liquid interface governing passivity are notoriously challenging to study. In this work, a combination of synchrotron&#8208;based techniques and electrochemical methods is used to investigate the passive film breakdown of a Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloy, which is&#160;used in many industrial applications. This alloy is found to be active toward oxygen evolution reaction (OER), and the OER onset coincides with the loss of passivity and severe metal dissolution. The OER mechanism involves the oxidation of Mo4+ sites in the oxide film to Mo6+ that can be dissolved, which results in passivity breakdown. This is fundamentally different from typical transpassive breakdown of Cr&#8208;containing alloys where Cr6+ is postulated to be dissolved at high anodic potentials, which is not observed here. At high current densities, OER also leads to acidification of the solution near the surface, further triggering metal dissolution. The OER plays an important role in the mechanism of passivity breakdown of Ni&#8211;Cr&#8211;Mo alloys due to their catalytic activity, and this effect needs to be considered when studying the corrosion of catalytically active alloys.

         <title>Transition Metal&#8208;Based Therapies for Inflammatory Diseases</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A comprehensive overview of inflammatory therapy based on transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems from the aspects of rationale design strategies (types, nanozyme activity regulation, physical and chemical characteristics) and therapeutic mechanisms (scavenge, block, and delivery&#8208;based strategy) is provided in this review with an emphasis on the current challenges and prospects in this field.








Abstract
Inflammatory disease (ID) is a general term that covers all diseases in which chronic inflammation performs as the major manifestation of pathogenesis. Traditional therapies based on the anti&#8208;inflammatory and immunosuppressive drugs are palliative with the short&#8208;term remission. The emergence of nanodrugs has been reported to solve the potential causes and prevent recurrences, thus holding great potential for the treatment of IDs. Among various nanomaterial systems, transition metal&#8208;based smart nanosystems (TMSNs) with unique electronic structures possess therapeutic advantages owing to their large surface area to volume ratio, high photothermal conversion efficiency, X&#8208;ray absorption capacity, and multiple catalytic enzyme activities. In this review, the rationale, design principle, and therapeutic mechanisms of TMSNs for treatments of various IDs are summarized. Specifically, TMSNs can not only be designed to scavenge danger signals, such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species and cell&#8208;free DNA, but also can be engineered to block the mechanism of initiating inflammatory responses. In addition, TMSNs can be further applied as nanocarriers to deliver anti&#8208;inflammatory drugs. Finally, the opportunities and challenges of TMSNs are discussed, and the future directions of TMSN&#8208;based ID treatment for clinical applications are emphasized.

         <title>Patterning Quantum Dots via Photolithography: A Review</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum dots (QDs) are used as promising materials for next&#8208;generation displays due to their excellent electrical/optical properties. Strategies for patterning QDs via photolithography (conventional photolithography, lift off process, and direct photolithography) are comprehensively reviewed. This review also discusses the prospects for patterned QDs in terms of their structural and physical properties.








Abstract
Pixelating patterns of red, green, and blue quantum dots (QDs) is a critical challenge for realizing high&#8208;end displays with bright and vivid images for virtual, augmented, and mixed reality. Since QDs must be processed from a solution, their patterning process is completely different from the conventional techniques used in the organic light&#8208;emitting diode and liquid crystal display industries. Although innovative QD patterning technologies are being developed, photopatterning based on the light&#8208;induced chemical conversion of QD films is considered one of the most promising methods for forming micrometer&#8208;scale QD patterns that satisfy the precision and fidelity required for commercialization. Moreover, the practical impact will be significant as it directly exploits mature photolithography technologies and facilities that are widely available in the semiconductor industry. This article reviews recent progress in the effort to form QD patterns via photolithography. The review begins with a general description of the photolithography process. Subsequently, different types of photolithographical methods applicable to QD patterning are introduced, followed by recent achievements using these methods in forming high&#8208;resolution QD patterns. The paper also discusses prospects for future research directions.

         <title>Mechanically&#8208;Compliant Bioelectronic Interfaces through Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Conducting Polymer Hydrogel Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating for long&#8208;term biointerfacing: Fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes is fabricated through the engineering of nanocrystalline domains at the interface, enabling long&#8208;term electrocardiogram recording and electrical pacing without failure.








Abstract
Because of their distinct electrochemical and mechanical properties, conducting polymer hydrogels have been widely exploited as soft, wet, and conducting coatings for conventional metallic electrodes, providing mechanically compliant interfaces and mitigating foreign body responses. However, the long&#8208;term viability of these hydrogel coatings is hindered by concerns regarding fatigue crack propagation and/or delamination caused by repetitive volumetric expansion/shrinkage during long&#8208;term electrical interfacing. This study reports a general yet reliable approach to achieving a fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting polymer hydrogel coating on conventional metallic bioelectrodes by engineering nanocrystalline domains at the interface between the hydrogel and metallic substrates. It demonstrates the efficacy of this robust, biocompatible, and fatigue&#8208;resistant conducting hydrogel coating in cardiac pacing, showcasing its ability to effectively reduce the pacing threshold voltage and enhance the long&#8208;term reliability of electric stimulation. This study findings highlight the potential of its approach as a promising design and fabrication strategy for the next generation of seamless bioelectronic&#160;interfaces.

         <title>Patterning Complex Line Motifs in Thin Films Using Immersion&#8208;Controlled Reaction&#8208;Diffusion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced. By tying reaction&#8208;diffusion processes to immersion, wafer&#8208;scale line motifs are created. In R&#8208;DIP, a balance between diffusion and immersion speed provides robustness toward defects and highly uniform line spacing. The functionality potential of R&#8208;DIP is demonstrated by manufacturing tunable optical diffraction gratings and an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor.








Abstract
The discovery of self&#8208;organization principles that enable scalable routes toward complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here, reaction&#8208;diffusion driven, immersion&#8208;controlled patterning (R&#8208;DIP) is introduced, a self&#8208;organization strategy using immersion&#8208;controlled reaction&#8208;diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction&#8208;diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands&#8208;on tunability of the line spacing (d=10&#8722;300&#956;m$d = 10-300 \; \umu \text{m}$) as well as error&#8208;correction against defects. This immersion&#8208;driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi&#8208;dimensional patterns such as square&#8208;, diamond&#8208;, rectangle&#8208;, and triangle&#8208;shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer&#8208;scale diffraction gratings with user&#8208;defined features as well as an opto&#8208;mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.

&lt;p&gt;Here, reaction-diffusion driven immersion-controlled patterning (R-DIP) is introduced. By tying reaction-diffusion processes to immersion, wafer-scale line motifs are created. In R-DIP, a balance between diffusion and immersion speed provides robustness toward defects and highly uniform line spacing. The functionality potential of R-DIP is demonstrated by manufacturing tunable optical diffraction gratings and an opto-mechanical sensor.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The discovery of self-organization principles that enable scalable routes toward complex functional materials has proven to be a persistent challenge. Here, reaction-diffusion driven, immersion-controlled patterning (R-DIP) is introduced, a self-organization strategy using immersion-controlled reaction-diffusion for targeted line patterning in thin films. By modulating immersion speeds, the movement of a reaction-diffusion front over gel films is controlled, which induces precipitation of highly uniform lines at the reaction front. A balance between the immersion speed and diffusion provides both hands-on tunability of the line spacing (d=10&#8722;300&#956;m$d = 10-300 \; \umu \text{m}$) as well as error-correction against defects. This immersion-driven patterning strategy is widely applicable, which is demonstrated by producing line patterns of silver/silver oxide nanoparticles, silver chromate, silver dichromate, and lead carbonate. Through combinatorial stacking of different line patterns, hybrid materials with multi-dimensional patterns such as square-, diamond-, rectangle-, and triangle-shaped motifs are fabricated. The functionality potential and scalability is demonstrated by producing both wafer-scale diffraction gratings with user-defined features as well as an opto-mechanical sensor based on Moir&#233;&#160;patterning.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs.








Abstract
Living organisms have a very mysterious and powerful sensory computing system based on ion activity. Interestingly, studies&#160;on iontronic devices in the past few years have proposed a promising platform for simulating the sensing and computing functions of living organisms, because: 1) iontronic devices can generate, store, and transmit a variety of signals by adjusting the concentration and spatiotemporal distribution of ions, which analogs to how the brain performs intelligent functions by alternating ion flux and polarization; 2) through ionic&#8208;electronic coupling, iontronic devices can bridge the biosystem with electronics and offer profound implications for soft electronics; 3) with the diversity of ions, iontronic devices can be designed to recognize specific ions or molecules by customizing the charge selectivity, and the ionic conductivity and capacitance can be adjusted to respond to external stimuli for a variety of sensing schemes, which can be more difficult for electron&#8208;based devices. This review provides a comprehensive overview of emerging neuromorphic sensory computing by iontronic devices, highlighting representative concepts of both low&#8208;level and high&#8208;level sensory computing and introducing important material and device breakthroughs. Moreover, iontronic devices as a means of neuromorphic sensing and computing are discussed regarding the pending challenges and future directions.

         <title>Realization and Control of Bulk and Surface Modes in 3D Nanomagnonic Networks by Additive Manufacturing of Ferromagnets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ferromagnetic nanodevices are expected to provide enhanced functionality for data storage, magnonics, and spintronics. An additive manufacturing methodology for ferromagnetic Ni is reported by which different networks of 3D interconnected nanotubes are produced. The structures show engineered magnon modes at surprisingly high GHz frequencies and a clear discrepancy between bulk and surface states, opening new perspectives in magnonics.








Abstract
The high&#8208;density integration in information technology fuels the research on functional 3D nanodevices. Particularly ferromagnets promise multifunctional 3D devices for nonvolatile data storage, high&#8208;speed data processing, and non&#8208;charge&#8208;based logic operations via spintronics and magnonics concepts. However, 3D nanofabrication of ferromagnets is extremely challenging. In this work, an additive manufacturing methodology is reported, and unprecedented 3D ferromagnetic nanonetworks with a woodpile&#8208;structure unit cell are fabricated. The collective spin dynamics (magnons) at frequencies up to 25 GHz are investigated by Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) microscopy and micromagnetic simulations. A clear discrepancy of about 10 GHz is found between the bulk and surface modes, which are engineered by different unit cell sizes in the Ni&#8208;based nanonetworks. The angle&#8208; and spatially&#8208;dependent modes demonstrate opportunities for multi&#8208;frequency signal processing in 3D circuits via magnons. The developed synthesis route will allow one to create 3D magnonic crystals with chiral unit cells, which are a prerequisite toward surface modes with topologically protected&#160;properties.

         <title>Rising of Dynamic Polyimide Materials: A Versatile Dielectric for Electrical and Electronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
How to realize the recycling of polyimide materials has been increasingly recognized as a critical point to develop sustainable society. Damage forms of polyimide, current strategies and methods for mechanical damage, and conceptual design for electrical damage are reviewed. The challenges and opportunities in dynamic polyimides for the reasonably designing molecular structure are proposed.








Abstract
Polyimides (PIs) are widely used in circuit components, electrical insulators, and power systems in modern electronic devices and large electrical appliances. Electrical/mechanical damage of materials are important factors that threaten reliability and service lifetime. Dynamic (self&#8208;healable, recyclable and degradable) PIs, a promising class of materials that successfully improve electrical/mechanical properties after damage, are anticipated to solve this issue. The viewpoints and perspectives on the status and future trends of dynamic PI based on a few existing documents are shared. The main damage forms of PI dielectric materials in the application process are first introduced, and initial strategies and schemes to solve these problems are proposed. Fundamentally, the bottleneck issues faced by the development of dynamic PIs are indicated, and the relationship between various damage forms and the universality of the method is evaluated. The potential mechanism of the dynamic PI to deal with electrical damage is highlighted and several feasible prospective schemes to address electrical damage are discussed. This study is concluded by presenting a short outlook and future improvements to systems, challenges, and solutions of dynamic PI in electrical insulation. The summary of theory and practice should encourage policy development favoring energy conservation and environmental protection and promoting sustainability.

         <title>Sorption&#8208;Induced Fiber Optic Plasmonic Gas Sensing via Small Grazing Angle of Incidence</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method to fabricate a new class of plasmon&#8208;based nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite films that realizes a distinct sorption&#8208;induced high&#8208;sensitive plasmonic gas sensing on the fiber optic sensor platform is reported. The nanoparticle&#8208;polymer composite film provides tunable optical features, specifically those associated with the epsilon near zero and localized surface plasmon resonance regions of the plasmonic nanoparticles' optical response.








Abstract
Sensing technologies based on plasmonic nanomaterials are of interest for various chemical, biological, environmental, and medical applications. In this work, an incorporation strategy of colloidal plasmonic nanoparticles (pNPs) in microporous polymer for realizing distinct sorption&#8208;induced plasmonic sensing is reported. This approach is demonstrated by introducing tin&#8208;doped indium oxide pNPs into a polymer of intrinsic microporosity (PIM&#8208;1). The composite film (pNPs&#8208;polymer) provides distinct and tunable optical features on the fiber optic (FO) platform that can be used as a signal transducer for gas sensing (e.g., CO2) under atmospheric conditions. The resulting pNPs&#8208;polymer composite demonstrates high sensitivity response on FO in the evanescent field configuration, provided by the dramatic response of modes above the total&#8208;internal&#8208;reflection angle. Furthermore, by varying the pNPs content in the polymer matrix, the optical behavior of the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film can be tuned to affect the operational wavelength by over several hundred nanometers and the sensitivity of the sensor in the near&#8208;infrared range. It is also shown that the pNPs&#8208;polymer composite film exhibits remarkable stability over a period of more than 10 months by mitigating the physical aging issue of the polymer.

         <title>Magnetization Control of Zero&#8208;Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zero&#8208;field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non&#8208;volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.








Abstract
The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal&#8208;conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non&#8208;volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero&#8208;field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt&#8208;inserted non&#8208;centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero&#8208;field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first&#8208;principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.

     alt="Magnetization Control of Zero-Field Intrinsic Superconducting Diode Effect"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Zero-field SDE is demonstrated in Fe/Pt-inserted non-centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices with the magnetic toroidal moment. The periodic insertion of Fe with Pt into the superlattices increases the nonreciprocity of the critical current in the absence of a magnetic field. These findings can be utilized to realize non-volatile memories and logic circuits with ultralow power consumption.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The superconducting diode effect (SDE), which causes a superconducting state in one direction and a normal-conducting state in another, has significant potential for developing ultralow power consumption circuits and non-volatile memory. However, the practical control of the SDE necessities the precise tuning of current, temperature, magnetic field, or magnetism. Therefore, the mechanisms of the SDE must be understood to develop novel materials and devices capable of realizing the SDE under more controlled and robust conditions. This study demonstrates an intrinsic zero-field SDE with an efficiency of up to 40% in Fe/Pt-inserted non-centrosymmetric Nb/V/Ta superconducting artificial superlattices. The polarity and magnitude of the zero-field SDE are controllable by the direction of magnetization, indicating that the effective exchange field acts on Cooper pairs. Furthermore, the first-principles calculation indicates that the SDE can be enhanced by an asymmetric configuration of proximity induced magnetic moments in superconducting layers, which induces a magnetic toroidal moment. This study has important implications regarding the development of novel materials and devices that can effectively control the SDE. Moreover, the magnetization control of the SDE is expected to aid in the designing of superconducting quantum devices and establishing a material platform for topological superconductors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Recent Advances and Opportunities of Eco&#8208;Friendly Ternary Copper Halides: A New Superstar in Optoelectronic Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ternary copper halides (TCHs) have generated considerable attention for the exceptional structure diversity and fascinating optoelectronic properties. The recent advances of currently explored TCHs are systemically summarized, regarding the crystal and electronic structure, synthesis strategy, photophysical mechanism, luminescence regulation, environmental stability, and their emerging applications. Moreover, current existing challenges and possible development directions are proposed for their further development.








Abstract
Recently, the newly&#8208;emerging lead&#8208;free metal&#8208;halide materials with less toxicity and superior optoelectronic properties have received wide attention as the safer and potentially more robust alternatives to lead&#8208;based perovskite counterparts. Among them, ternary copper halides (TCHs) have become a vital group due to their unique features, including abundant structural diversity, ease of synthesis, unprecedented optoelectronic properties, high abundance, and low cost. Although the recent efforts in this field have made certain progresses, some scientific and technological issues still remain unresolved. Herein, a comprehensive and up&#8208;to&#8208;date overview of recent progress on the fundamental characteristics of TCH materials and their versatile applications is presented, which contains topics such as: i) crystal and electronic structure features and synthesis strategies; ii) mechanisms of self&#8208;trapped excitons, luminescence regulation, and environmental stability; and iii) their burgeoning optoelectronic devices of phosphor&#8208;converted white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs), electroluminescent LEDs, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, X&#8208;ray scintillators, photodetectors, sensors, and memristors. Finally, the current challenges together with future perspectives on the development of TCH materials and applications are also critically described, which is considered to be critical for accelerating the commercialization of these rapidly evolving technologies.

         <title>One&#8208;Pot Synthesis and Excited&#8208;State Dynamics of Null Exciton&#8208;Coupled Diketopyrrolopyrroles Oligo&#8208;Grids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Covalent diketopyrrolopyrrole dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid with cyclic rigid structures are synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8208;Crafts reaction. They both display null exciton couplings and solvent&#8208;dependent excited&#8208;state dynamics. In toluene, they exhibit monomer&#8208;like photophysical properties. However, in benzonitrile, especially [2]Grid forms the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state faster and more efficiently, which further recombines to generate the triplet excited state.








Abstract
Exciton coupling in molecular aggregates plays a vital role in impacting and fine&#8208;tuning optoelectronic materials and their efficiencies in devices. A versatile platform to decipher aggregation&#8208;property relationships is built around multichromophoric architectures. Here, a series of cyclic diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) oligomers featuring nanoscale gridarene structures and rigid bifluorenyl spacers are designed and synthesized via one&#8208;pot Friedel&#8211;Crafts reaction. DPP dimer [2]Grid and trimer [3]Grid, which are cyclic rigid nanoarchitectures of rather different sizes, are further characterized via steady&#8208;state and time&#8208;resolved absorption and fluorescence spectroscopies. They exhibit monomer&#8208;like spectroscopic signatures in the steady&#8208;state measurements, from which null exciton couplings are derived. Moreover, in an apolar solvent, high fluorescence quantum yields and excited&#8208;state dynamics that resembled DPP monomer are gathered. In a polar solvent, the localized singlet excited state on a single DPP dissociates into the adjacent null coupling DPP with charge transfer characteristics. This pathway facilitates the evolution of&#160;the symmetry&#8208;broken charge&#8208;separated state (SB&#8208;CS). Notable is the fact that the SB&#8208;CS of [2]Grid is, on one hand, in equilibrium with the singlet excited state and promotes, on the other hand, the formation of the triplet excited state with a yield of 32% via charge recombination.

         <title>Understanding and Suppressing Non&#8208;Radiative Recombination Losses in Non&#8208;Fullerene Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Minimizing non&#8208;radiative recombination losses in the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art non&#8208;fullerene solar cells is of utmost importance in order to achieve power conversion efficiencies over 20% in the future. This review discusses methods to accurately quantify non&#8208;radiative voltage losses as well as the current understanding of their origin and empirical strategies for reducing them.








Abstract
Organic solar cells benefit from non&#8208;fullerene acceptors (NFA) due to their high absorption coefficients, tunable frontier energy levels, and optical gaps, as well as their relatively high luminescence quantum efficiencies as compared to fullerenes. Those merits result in high yields of charge generation at a low or negligible energetic offset at the donor/NFA heterojunction, with efficiencies over 19% achieved for single&#8208;junction devices. Pushing this value significantly over 20% requires an increase in open&#8208;circuit voltage, which is currently still well below the thermodynamic limit. This can only be achieved by reducing non&#8208;radiative recombination, and hereby increasing the electroluminescence quantum efficiency of the photo&#8208;active layer. Here, current understanding of the origin of non&#8208;radiative decay, as well as an accurate quantification of the associated voltage losses are summarized. Promising strategies for suppressing these losses are highlighted, with focus on new material design, optimization of donor&#8211;acceptor combination, and blend morphology. This review aims at guiding researchers in their quest to find future solar harvesting donor&#8211;acceptor blends, which combine a high yield of exciton dissociation with a high yield of radiative free carrier recombination and low voltage losses, hereby closing the efficiency gap with inorganic and perovskite photovoltaics.

         <title>In Situ Covalent Reinforcement of a Benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;Tricarboxamide Supramolecular Polymer Enables Biomimetic, Tough, and Fibrous Hydrogels and Bioinks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Creating fibrillar yet tough synthetic hydrogel and bioink remains highly desired. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils; herein, a benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) based synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is reported for creating a tough hydrogel and bioink. The bioink enables 3D bioprinting of hMSCs spheroids and supports cartilage&#8208;like tissue formation within the hydrogel.








Abstract
Synthetic hydrogels often lack the load&#8208;bearing capacity and mechanical properties of native biopolymers found in tissue, such as cartilage. In natural tissues, toughness is often imparted via the combination of fibrous noncovalent self&#8208;assembly with key covalent bond formation. This controlled combination of supramolecular and covalent interactions remains difficult to engineer, yet can provide a clear strategy for advanced biomaterials. Here, a synthetic supramolecular/covalent strategy is investigated for creating a tough hydrogel that embodies the hierarchical fibrous architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM). A benzene&#8208;1,3,5&#8208;tricarboxamide (BTA) hydrogelator is developed with synthetically addressable norbornene handles that self&#8208;assembles to form a and viscoelastic hydrogel. Inspired by collagen's covalent cross&#8208;linking of fibrils, the mechanical properties are reinforced by covalent intra&#8208; and interfiber cross&#8208;links. At over 90% water, the hydrogels withstand up to 550% tensile strain, 90% compressive strain, and dissipated energy with recoverable hysteresis. The hydrogels are shear&#8208;thinning, can be 3D bioprinted with good shape fidelity, and can be toughened via&#160;covalent cross&#8208;linking. These materials enable the bioprinting of human mesenchymal stromal cell (hMSC) spheroids and subsequent differentiation into chondrogenic tissue. Collectively, these findings highlight the power of covalent reinforcement&#160;of supramolecular fibers, offering a strategy for the bottom&#8208;up design of dynamic, yet tough, hydrogels and bioinks.

         <title>4D Additive&#8211;Subtractive Manufacturing of Shape Memory Ceramics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient, precise, and scalable four&#8208;dimensional (4D)&#160;additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing paradigm for ceramics with multimode shape memory capabilities is developed. The balance between thermal expansion and shrinkage is the mechanism for ceramic 4D printing. A high flame ablation performance of complex&#8208;shaped ceramics is achieved with Al2O3&#8208;deposited SiOC&#8208;based nanocrystalline&#8208;amorphous dual&#8208;phase ceramic lattice structures.








Abstract
The development of high&#8208;temperature structural materials, such as ceramics, is limited by their extremely high melting points and the difficulty in building complicated architectures. Four&#8208;dimensional (4D) printing helps enhance the geometrical flexibility of ceramics. However, ceramic 4D printing systems are limited by the separate processes for shape and material transformations, low accuracy of morphing systems, low resolution of ceramic structures, and their time&#8208;intensive nature. Here, a paradigm for a one&#8208;step shape/material transformation, high&#8208;2D/3D/4D&#8208;precision, high&#8208;efficiency, and scalable 4D additive&#8211;subtractive manufacturing of shape memory ceramics is developed. Original/reverse and global/local multimode shape memory capabilities are achieved using macroscale SiOC&#8208;based ceramic materials. The uniformly deposited Al2O3&#8208;rich layer on the printed SiOC&#8208;based ceramic lattice structures results in an unusually high flame ablation performance of the complex&#8208;shaped ceramics. The proposed framework is expected to broaden the applications of high&#8208;temperature structural materials in the aerospace, electronics, biomedical, and art fields.

         <title>Ultralow&#8208;Dielectric&#8208;Constant Atomic Layers of Amorphous Carbon Nitride Topologically Derived from MXene</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are produced via topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. The resultant a&#8208;CN layers possess a low density of 0.55 g cm&#8722;3 and a high sp3 C level of 35.7%. As a result, a very low dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz is achieved for the 310&#8208;nm&#8208;thickness a&#8208;CN film with a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV cm&#8722;1.








Abstract
Low&#8208;dielectric&#8208;constant materials such as silicon dioxide serving as interconnect insulators in current integrated circuit face a great challenge due to their relatively high dielectric constant of &#8776;4, twice that of the recommended value by the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems, causing severe parasitic capacitance and associated response delay. Here, novel atomic layers of amorphous carbon nitride (a&#8208;CN) are prepared via a topological conversion of MXene&#8208;Ti3CNTx under bromine vapor. Remarkably, the assembled a&#8208;CN film exhibits an ultralow dielectric constant of 1.69 at 100 kHz, much lower than the previously reported dielectric materials such as amorphous carbon (2.2) and fluorinated&#8208;doped SiO2 (3.6), ascribed to the low density of 0.55&#160;g cm&#8722;3 and high sp3 C level of 35.7%. Moreover, the a&#8208;CN film has a breakdown strength of 5.6 MV&#160;cm&#8722;1, showing great potential in integrated circuit application.

         <title>Shaping Synthetic Multicellular and Complex Multimaterial Tissues via Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing of Microgels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The convergence of extrusion&#8208;based and volumetric bioprinting, with microgels as platform materials, provides the possibility to create complex structures on a cm3&#8208;scale in a fast and accurate manner. By leveraging the versatility of this platform, it is possible to introduce multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular features in user defined&#8208;architectures.








Abstract
In living tissues, cells express their functions following complex signals from their surrounding microenvironment. Capturing both hierarchical architectures at the micro&#8208; and macroscale, and anisotropic cell patterning remains a major challenge in bioprinting, and a bottleneck toward creating physiologically&#8208;relevant models. Addressing this limitation, a novel technique is introduced, termed Embedded Extrusion&#8208;Volumetric Printing (EmVP), converging extrusion&#8208;bioprinting and layer&#8208;less, ultra&#8208;fast volumetric bioprinting, allowing spatially pattern multiple inks/cell types. Light&#8208;responsive microgels are developed for the first time as bioresins (&#181;Resins) for light&#8208;based volumetric bioprinting, providing a microporous environment permissive for cell homing and self&#8208;organization. Tuning the mechanical and optical properties of gelatin&#8208;based microparticles enables their use as support bath for suspended extrusion printing, in which features containing high cell densities can be easily introduced. &#181;Resins can be sculpted within seconds with tomographic light projections into centimeter&#8208;scale, granular hydrogel&#8208;based, convoluted constructs. Interstitial microvoids enhanced differentiation of multiple stem/progenitor cells (vascular, mesenchymal, neural), otherwise not possible with conventional bulk hydrogels. As proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept, EmVP is applied to create complex synthetic biology&#8208;inspired intercellular communication models, where adipocyte differentiation is regulated by optogenetic&#8208;engineered pancreatic cells. Overall, EmVP offers new avenues for producing regenerative grafts with biological functionality, and for developing engineered living systems and (metabolic) disease models.

         <title>Short Peptide Nanofiber Biomaterials Ameliorate Local Hemostatic Capacity of Surgical Materials and Intraoperative Hemostatic Applications in Clinics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Short peptide nanofiber biomaterials are an intriguing surgical tool to serve as functional hemostatic devices and have claimed more and more advantages over traditional biomaterials and formulations. The comparable aspects in surgical applications, hemostatic mechnism, and emerging medical devices are addressed comprehensively in multiple surgical specialties.








Abstract
Short designer self&#8208;assembling peptide (dSAP) biomaterials are a new addition to the hemostat group. It may provide a diverse and robust toolbox for surgeons to integrate wound microenvironment with much safer and stronger hemostatic capacity than conventional materials and hemostatic agents. Especially in noncompressible torso hemorrhage (NCTH), diffuse mucosal surface bleeding, and internal medical bleeding (IMB), with respect to the optimal hemostatic formulation, dSAP biomaterials are the ingenious nanofiber alternatives to make bioactive neural scaffold, nasal packing, large mucosal surface coverage in gastrointestinal surgery (esophagus, gastric lesion, duodenum, and lower digestive tract), epicardiac cell&#8208;delivery carrier, transparent matrix barrier, and so on. Herein, in multiple surgical specialties, dSAP&#8208;biomaterial&#8208;based nano&#8208;hemostats achieve safe, effective, and immediate hemostasis, facile wound healing, and potentially reduce the risks in delayed bleeding, rebleeding, post&#8208;operative bleeding, or related complications. The biosafety in vivo, bleeding indications, tissue&#8208;sealing quality, surgical feasibility, and local usability are addressed comprehensively and sequentially and pursued to develop useful surgical techniques with better hemostatic performance. Here, the state of the art and all&#8208;round advancements of nano&#8208;hemostatic approaches in surgery are provided. Relevant critical insights will inspire exciting investigations on peptide nanotechnology, next&#8208;generation biomaterials, and better promising prospects in clinics.

         <title>A Rapid Self&#8208;Pumping Organohydrogel Dressing with Hydrophilic Fractal Microchannels to Promote Burn Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel with hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels by a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process is prepared, realizing &#8776;30 times enhancement in draining water than pure hydrogel. The rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing can accelerate burn wound healing by reducing dermal cavity (&#8776;42.5%), accelerating hair follicles (&#8776;13.5 times) and blood vessels (&#8776;6.6 times) regeneration.








Abstract
Burn wounds pose great challenges for conventional dressings because massive exudates oversecreted from swollen tissues and blisters seriously delay wound healing. Herein, a self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming&#8208;assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating&#8208;colliding&#8208;coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self&#8208;pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high&#8208;performance functional burn wound dressings.

Herein, a self-pumping organohydrogel dressing with hydrophilic fractal microchannels is reported that can rapidly drain excessive exudates with &#8776;30 times enhancement in efficiency compared with the pure hydrogel, and effectively promote burn wound healing. A creaming-assistant emulsion interfacial polymerization approach is proposed to create the hydrophilic fractal hydrogel microchannels in the self-pumping organohydrogel through a dynamic floating-colliding-coalescing process of organogel precursor droplets. In a murine burn wound model, the rapid self-pumping organohydrogel dressings can markedly reduce dermal cavity by &#8776;42.5%, accelerate blood vessel regeneration by &#8776;6.6 times, and hair follicle regeneration by &#8776;13.5 times, compared with the commercial dressing (Tegaderm). This study paves an avenue for designing high-performance functional burn wound dressings.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photoelectron &#8220;Bridge&#8221; in Van Der Waals Heterojunction for Enhanced Photocatalytic CO2 Conversion Under Visible Light</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Van der Waals heterojunctions as photocatalysts by traditional wet chemical methods encounter the challengeof charge transfer, because of steric hindrance and barriers caused by a large interfacial spacing. Introducing phosphoric acid molecules at the heterojunction interface acts as an electron "bridge" to eliminate the interfacial potential difference and create a photoelectron transport channel to promote the photocatalytic reaction.








Abstract
Constructing Van der Waals heterojunction is a crucial strategy to achieve excellent photocatalytic activity. However, in most Van der Waals heterojunctions synthesized by ex situ assembly, electron transfer encounters huge hindrances at the interface between the two components due to the large spacing and potential barrier. Herein, a phosphate&#8208;bridged Van der Waals heterojunction of cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)/tungsten disulfide (WS2) bridged by phosphate (xCoPc&#8208;nPO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2) is designed and prepared by the traditional wet chemistry method. By introducing a small phosphate molecule into the interface of CoPc and WS2, creates an electron &#8220;bridge&#8221;, resulting in a compact combination and eliminating the space barrier. Therefore, the phosphate (PO4&#8722;) bridge can serve as an efficient electron transfer channel in heterojunction and can efficiently transmit photoelectrons from WS2 to CoPc under excited states. These excited photoelectrons are captured by the catalytic central Co2+ in CoPc and subsequently convert CO2 molecules into CO and CH4 products, achieving&#160;17&#8208;fold enhancement on the 3CoPc&#8208;0.6PO4&#8722;&#8208;WS2 sample compared to that of pure WS2. Introducing a small molecule &#8220;bridge&#8221; to create an electron transfer channel provides a new perspective in designing efficient photocatalysts for photocatalytic CO2 reduction into valuable products.

         <title>Printable High&#8208;Efficiency and Stable FAPbBr3 Perovskite Solar Cells for Multifunctional Building&#8208;Integrated Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ intermediate phase transition&#8208;controlled blade&#8208;coating method for FAPbBr3 perovskite solar cells is introduced, which obtains a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.86% based on hole transport layer&#8208;free structures of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Semitransparent devices are fabricated and obtain high PCE of 8.61% at average visible light transmittance (AVT) =&#160;45% and PCE of 5.55% at AVT&#160;=&#160;53% for small devices and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules, respectively.








Abstract
Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) show great promise for next&#8208;generation building&#8208;integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) applications because of their abundance of raw materials, adjustable transparency, and cost&#8208;effective printable processing. Owing to the complex perovskite nucleation and growth control, the fabrication of large&#8208;area perovskite films for high&#8208;performance printed PSCs is still under active investigation. Herein, the study proposes an intermediate&#8208;phase&#8208;transition&#8208;assisted one&#8208;step blade coating for an intrinsic transparent formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) perovskite film. The intermediate complex optimizes the crystal growth path of FAPbBr3, resulting in a large&#8208;area, homogeneous, and dense absorber film. A champion efficiency of 10.86% with high open&#8208;circuit voltage up to 1.57&#160;V is obtained with a simplified device architecture of glass/FTO/SnO2/FAPbBr3/carbon. Moreover, the unencapsulated devices maintain 90% of their initial power conversion efficiency after aging at 75&#160;&#176;C for 1000&#160;h in ambient air, and 96% after maximum power point tracking for 500&#160;h. The printed semitransparent PSCs, with average visible light transmittance over 45%, demonstrate high efficiencies for both small devices (8.6%) and 10&#160;&#215;&#160;10&#160;cm2 modules (5.55%). Finally, the ability to customize the color, transparency, and thermal insulation properties of FAPbBr3 PSCs makes them high prospects as multifunctional BIPVs.

Two acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor&#8242;&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor type organic emitters named NTQ and BTQ with narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13 eV are employed as short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) emitters for organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) applications. The resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ show good SWIR radiation properties, with a maximal radiant exitance of 1.12 mW cm&#8208;2 at 1140 nm, one of the highest values for OLEDs emitting at SWIR region.








Abstract
Short&#8208;wavelength infrared (SWIR) organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) have attracted great interest due to their potential applications in biological imaging, infrared lighting, optical communication, environmental monitoring, and surveillance. Due to an intrinsic limitation posed by the energy&#8208;gap law, achieving high&#8208;brightness in SWIR OLEDs remains a challenge. Herein, the study reports the use of novel A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules NTQ and BTQ for high&#8208;performance SWIR OLEDs. Benefiting from multiple D&#8211;A effect in conjugated skeleton, the small molecules NTQ and BTQ exhibit narrow optical gaps of 1.23 and 1.13&#160;eV, respectively. SWIR electroluminescence (EL) emission from OLEDs based on NTQ and BTQ is achieved, with emission peaks at 1140 and 1175&#160;nm, respectively. Not only owing to a negligible efficiency roll&#8208;off across the full range of applied current density but also the ability to afford a high operation current density of 5200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, the resultant SWIR OLEDs based on NTQ exhibit a maximal radiant exitance of =1.12&#160;mW cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the NTQ&#8208;based OLEDs also possess sub&#8208;gap turn&#8208;on voltage of 0.85&#160;V, which is close to the physical limits derived from the generalized Kirchhoff and Planck equation. This work demonstrates that A&#8211;D&#8211;A&#8242;&#8211;D&#8211;A type small molecules offer significant promise for NIR/SWIR emitting material innovations.

         <title>NbTe4 Phase&#8208;Change Material: Breaking the Phase&#8208;Change Temperature Balance in 2D Van der Waals Transition&#8208;Metal Binary Chalcogenide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study explores chalcogen&#8208;rich 2D transition&#8208;metal (TM)&#8208;chalcogenides' potential for phase&#8208;change memory. The focus is on the layered TM&#8208;chalcogenide NbTe4, showing a lower melting point and higher crystallization temperature than traditional phase&#8208;change materials (PCMs) such as Ge2Sb2Te5. Further device evaluation demonstrates that NbTe4 is an excellent solution for current PCM issueslike poor thermal stability and the high Reset energy.








Abstract
2D van der Waals (vdW) transition metal di&#8208;chalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in the nonvolatile memory field for their tunable electrical properties, scalability, and potential for phase engineering. However, their complex switching mechanism and complicated fabrication methods pose challenges for mass production. Sputtering is a promising technique for large&#8208;area 2D vdW TMD fabrication, but the high melting point (typically Tm &gt; 1000 &#176;C) of TMDs requires elevated temperatures for good crystallinity. This study focuses on the low&#8208;Tm 2D vdW TM tetra&#8208;chalcogenides and identifies NbTe4 as a promising candidate with an ultra&#8208;low Tm of around 447 &#176;C (onset temperature). As&#8208;grown NbTe4 forms an amorphous phase upon deposition that can be crystallized by annealing at temperatures above 272 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of a low Tm and a high crystallization temperature Tc can resolve important issues facing current phase&#8208;change memory compounds, such as high Reset energies and poor thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Therefore, NbTe4 holds great promise as a potential solution to these issues.

The focus is on the layered TM-chalcogenide NbTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, showing a lower melting point and higher crystallization temperature than traditional phase-change materials (PCMs) such as Ge&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Te&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. Further device evaluation demonstrates that NbTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is an excellent solution for current PCM issueslike poor thermal stability and the high Reset energy.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2D van der Waals (vdW) transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDs) have garnered significant attention in the nonvolatile memory field for their tunable electrical properties, scalability, and potential for phase engineering. However, their complex switching mechanism and complicated fabrication methods pose challenges for mass production. Sputtering is a promising technique for large-area 2D vdW TMD fabrication, but the high melting point (typically &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;gt; 1000 &#176;C) of TMDs requires elevated temperatures for good crystallinity. This study focuses on the low-&lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; 2D vdW TM tetra-chalcogenides and identifies NbTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; as a promising candidate with an ultra-low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; of around 447 &#176;C (onset temperature). As-grown NbTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; forms an amorphous phase upon deposition that can be crystallized by annealing at temperatures above 272 &#176;C. The simultaneous presence of a low &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and a high crystallization temperature &lt;i&gt;T&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; can resolve important issues facing current phase-change memory compounds, such as high Reset energies and poor thermal stability of the amorphous phase. Therefore, NbTe&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; holds great promise as a potential solution to these issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Robust and Sustainable Indium Anode Leading to Efficient and Stable Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed, achieving the impressive PCE of 18.92% and 15.20%, respectively. This interlayer significantly extends the thermal stability of derived OSCs with a T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.








Abstract
The fast degradation of the charge&#8208;extraction interface at indium tin oxide (ITO) poses a significant obstacle to achieving long&#8208;term stability for organic solar cells (OSCs). Herein, a sustainable approach for recycling non&#8208;sustainable indium to construct efficient and stable OSCs and scale&#8208;up modules is developed. It is revealed that the recovered indium chloride (InCl3) from indium oxide waste can be applied as an effective hole&#8208;selective interfacial layer for the ITO electrode (noted as InCl3&#8211;ITO anode) through simple aqueous fabrication, facilitating not only energy level alignment to photoactive blends but also mitigating parasitic absorption and charge recombination losses of the corresponding OSCs. As a result, OSCs and modules consisting of InCl3&#8211;ITO anodes achieve remarkable power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 18.92% and 15.20% (active area of 18.73 cm2), respectively. More importantly, the InCl3&#8211;ITO anode can significantly extend the thermal stability of derived OSCs, with an extrapolated T80 lifetime of &#8776;10&#160;000 h.

         <title>Exotic Electronic Properties of 2D Nanosheets Isolated from Liquid Phase Exfoliated Phyllosilicate Minerals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation is applied to common layered phyllosilicate crystals of mica and chlorite schist to fabricate high&#8208;yield nanosheet suspensions. Once commonly believed to be spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert, suspensions of micene and chlorene nanosheets are shown to have unique spectral fingerprints, tuneable bandgaps, and superlative electrochemical performances for the hydrogen evolution reaction.








Abstract
Spectrally inactive, electrically insulating, and chemically inert are adjectives broadly used to describe phyllosilicate minerals like mica and chlorite. Here, the above is disproved by demonstrating aqueous suspensions of liquid exfoliated nanosheets from five bulk mica types and chlorite schist. Nanosheet quality is confirmed via transmission electron and X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectroscopies, as well as electron diffraction. Through Raman spectroscopy, a previously unreported size&#8208; and layer&#8208;dependent spectral fingerprint is observed. When analyzing the high&#8208;yield suspensions (&#8776;1&#160;mg&#160;mL&#8722;1) through UV&#8211;vis spectroscopy, all phyllosilicates present bandgap (Eg) narrowing from &#8776;7&#160;eV in the bulk to &#8776;4&#160;eV for monolayers. Unusually, the bandgap is inversely proportional to the areal size (A) of the nanosheets, measured via atomic force microscopy. Due to an unrecorded quantum confinement effect, nanosheet electronic properties scale toward semiconducting behavior (bandgap &#8776;3&#160;eV) as nanosheet area increases. Furthermore, modeling X&#8208;ray diffraction spectra shows that the root cause of the initial bandgap narrowing is lattice relaxation. Finally, with their broad range of isomorphically substituted ions, phyllosilicate nanosheets show remarkable catalytic properties for hydrogen production.

         <title>Strain&#8208;Control of Cycloidal Spin Order in a Metallic Van der Waals Magnet</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Systematic and reversible control of cycloidal spin order with strains is demonstrated in the metallic van der Waals magnet Cr1/3TaS2 via strain&#8208;induced Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions. The remarkable tunability of Cr1/3TaS2 exemplifies the great potential of layered chiral magnets for highly&#8208;efficient straintronic applications.








Abstract
The manipulation of magnetism through strain control is a captivating area of research with potential applications for low&#8208;power devices that do not require dissipative currents. Recent investigations of insulating multiferroics have unveiled tunable relationships among polar lattice distortions, Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions (DMI), and cycloidal spin orders that break inversion symmetry. These findings have raised the possibility of utilizing strain or strain gradient to manipulate intricate magnetic states by changing polarization. However, the effectiveness of manipulating cycloidal spin orders in &#8220;metallic&#8221; materials with screened magnetism&#8208;relevant electric polarization remains uncertain. In this study, the reversible strain control of cycloidal spin textures in a metallic van der Waals magnet, Cr1/3TaS2, through the modulation of polarization and DMI induced by strain is demonstrated. With thermally&#8208;induced biaxial strains and isothermally&#8208;applied uniaxial strains, systematic manipulation of the sign and wavelength of the cycloidal spin textures is realized, respectively. Additionally, unprecedented reflectivity reduction under strain and domain modification at a record&#8208;low current density are also discovered. These findings establish a connection between polarization and cycloidal spins in metallic materials and present a new avenue for utilizing the remarkable tunability of cycloidal magnetic textures and optical functionality in van der Waals metals with strain.

         <title>Synthesis of Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with Controlled Anisotropy using Surface&#8208;Selective Ligand Pairs</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zwitterionic CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are synthesized with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding affinity on different surface facets of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals are revealed. This study provides design rules for the further exploration of anisotropic lead halide perovskite nanocrystals.








Abstract
Mechanistic studies of the morphology of lead halide perovskite nanocrystals (LHP&#8208;NCs) are hampered by a lack of generalizable suitable synthetic strategies and ligand systems. Here, the synthesis of zwitterionic CsPbBr3 NCs is presented with controlled anisotropy using a proposed &#8220;surface&#8208;selective ligand pairs&#8221; strategy. Such a strategy provides a platform to systematically study the binding affinity of capping ligand pairs and the resulting LHP morphologies. By using zwitterionic ligands (ZwL) with varying structures, majority ZwL&#8208;capped LHP NCs with controlled morphology are obtained, including anisotropic nanoplatelets and nanorods, for the first time. Combining experiments with density functional theory calculations, factors that govern the ligand binding on the different surface facets of LHP&#8208;NCs are revealed, including the steric bulkiness of the ligand, the number of binding sites, and the charge distance between binding moieties. This study provides guidance for the further exploration of anisotropic LHP&#8208;NCs.

         <dc:description>
There is great potential for air humidity not only to provide water for drinking and agriculture, but also to be used for energy/fuel production, energy conservation, and humidity/thermal management. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) technology makes this possible even in dry regions. The purpose of this paper is to review comprehensively the materials, designs, components, and application of SAWH.








Abstract
Freshwater scarcity is a global challenge posing threats to the lives and daily activities of humankind such that two&#8208;thirds of the global population currently experience water shortages. Atmospheric water, irrespective of geographical location, is considered as an alternative water source. Sorption&#8208;based atmospheric water harvesting (SAWH) has recently emerged as an efficient strategy for decentralized water production. SAWH thus opens up a self&#8208;sustaining source of freshwater that can potentially support the global population for various applications. In this review, the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art of SAWH, considering its operation principle, thermodynamic analysis, energy assessment, materials, components, different designs, productivity improvement, scale&#8208;up, and application for drinking water, is first extensively explored. Thereafter, the practical integration and potential application of SAWH, beyond drinking water, for wide range of utilities in agriculture, fuel/electricity production, thermal management in building services, electronic devices, and textile are comprehensively discussed. The various strategies to reduce human reliance on natural water resources by integrating SAWH into existing technologies, particularly in underdeveloped countries, in order to satisfy the interconnected needs for food, energy, and water are also examined. This study further highlights the urgent need and future research directions to intensify the design and development of hybrid&#8208;SAWH systems for sustainability and diverse applications.

         <title>Flexible Organic Transistors for Biosensing: Devices and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Flexible and stretchable organic transistors for biosensing are comprehensively reviewed, with detailed discussions on advanced functionalization strategies and the wide applications of organic transistors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces. Special attention is paid to the innovations in stretchable devices and emerging e&#8208;skin and smart textiles. The remaining challenges and future opportunities are discussed.








Abstract
Flexible and stretchable biosensors can offer seamless and conformable biological&#8211;electronic interfaces for continuously acquiring high&#8208;fidelity signals, permitting numerous emerging applications. Organic thin film transistors (OTFTs) are ideal transducers for flexible and stretchable biosensing due to their soft nature, inherent amplification function, biocompatibility, ease of functionalization, low cost, and device diversity. In consideration of the rapid advances in flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors and their broad applications, herein, a timely and comprehensive review is provided. It starts with a detailed introduction to the features of various OTFTs including organic field&#8208;effect transistors and organic electrochemical transistors, and the functionalization strategies for biosensing, with a highlight on the seminal work and up&#8208;to&#8208;date achievements. Then, the applications of flexible&#8208;OTFT&#8208;based biosensors in wearable, implantable, and portable electronics, as well as neuromorphic biointerfaces are detailed. Subsequently, special attention is paid to emerging stretchable organic transistors including planar and fibrous devices. The routes to impart stretchability, including structural engineering and material engineering, are discussed, and the implementations of stretchable organic transistors in e&#8208;skin and smart textiles are included. Finally, the remaining challenges and the future opportunities in this field are summarized.
