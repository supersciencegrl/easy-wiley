         <title>2D Metastable&#8208;Phase Hafnium Oxide Triggers Hydrogen Spillover for Boosting Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hydrogen spillover is a widespread interfacial phenomenon involving the migration of equivalent amounts of H atoms from metal to support. The design of the substrate is crucial for triggering hydrogen spillover. Metastable&#8208;phase hexagonal phase hafnium oxide substrate can trigger efficient hydrogen spillover after loading ruthenium, yet the same phenomenon is forbidden on the stable phase monoclinic phase hafnium oxide substrate.








Abstract
Hydrogen (H) manipulation plays a significantly important role in many important applications, in which the occurrence of hydrogen spillover generally shows substrate&#8208;dependent behavior. It therefore remains an open question about how to trigger the hydrogen spillover on the substrates that are generally hydrogen spillover forbidden. Here a new metastable&#8208;phase 2D edge&#8208;sharing oxide: six&#8208;hexagonal phase&#8208;hafnium oxide (Hex&#8208;HfO2, space group: P63mc (186)) with the coordination number of six is demonstrated, which serves as an ideal platform for activating efficient hydrogen spillover after loading Ru nanoclusters (Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2). For a stark comparison, the hydrogen spillover is strongly forbidden when using stable monoclinic phase HfO2 (M&#8208;HfO2, space group: P21/c (14), coordination number: seven) as the substrate. When applied in an acidic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER), Ru/Hex&#8208;HfO2 exhibits a low overpotential of 8&#160;mV at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high Ru utilization activity of 14.37 A mgRu&#8722;1 at 30&#160;mV. Detailed mechanism reveals the positive H adsorption free energy on Hex&#8208;HfO2, indicating that H is more likely to spillover on Hex&#8208;HfO2. Furthermore, the strong interaction between Ru and Hex&#8208;HfO2 optimizes the desorption of hydrogen intermediate, thus facilitating the surface H spillover. The discovery provides new guidance for developing metastable&#8208;phase oxide substrates for advanced catalysis.

         <title>Engineered Stem Cell Booster Breaks&#160;Pathological Barriers to Treat Chronic Pancreatitis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In the treatment of chronic pancreatitis with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), two main pathological barriers are encountered: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based nitric oxide system is constructed to regulate collagen fibers and enhance therapeutic efficacy of MSCs, showing the synergetic effect and successfully breaking two pathological barriers.








Abstract
Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a long&#8208;standing progressive fibrosis and has long been considered incurable, which remains a heavy health burden worldwide. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) with anti&#8208;fibrosis properties are currently used in the treatment of fibroinflammatory diseases. However, its therapeutic effect is limited mainly due to two main types of pathological barriers in CP: 1) Fibrotic collagen hinders cell delivery, and 2) Malignant microenvironment attacks cell inactivation. Here, a MSCs&#8208;based exogenous nitric oxide (NO) delivery system (MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO) is constructed. In the MSCs&#8208;Lip@RNO, NO not only can be a cell booster to regulate collagen fibers, relieve the vascular compression and enhance the accumulation of MSCs in the whole pancreas, but also can form a protective gas layer on the cell surface, which enhances the therapeutic effect of MSCs. In the CP rat model, the pancreatic injury and fibrosis are reduced with 7 days after a single dose administration of this long&#8208;acting MSCs. Collectively, this study offers a promising strategy for enhancing the delivery and therapeutic efficacy of MSCs to break pathological barriers in CP treatment.

         <title>Folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA Origami for Controlled Translation and Viral Vector Packaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The packaging of mRNA into a compact, predefined shape can impact cellular delivery. This study presents a first set of design rules for the efficient folding of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, while preserving its initial translation functionality, which is demonstrated extracellularly as well as in vitro by using virus capsid proteins for packaging and enhancing cellular uptake.








Abstract
mRNA is an important molecule in vaccine development and treatment of genetic disorders. Its capability to hybridize with DNA oligonucleotides in a programmable manner facilitates the formation of RNA&#8208;DNA origami structures, which can possess a well&#8208;defined morphology and serve as rigid supports for mRNA delivery. However, to date, comprehensive studies on the requirements for efficient folding of mRNA into distinct mRNA&#8208;DNA structures while preserving its translation functionality remain elusive. Here, the impact of design parameters on the folding of protein&#8208;encoding mRNA into mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures is systematically investigated and the importance of the availability of ribosome&#8208;binding sequences on the translation efficiency is demonstrated. Furthermore, these hybrid structures are encapsulated inside virus capsids resulting in protecting them against nuclease degradation and also in enhancement of their cellular uptake. This multicomponent system therefore showcases a modular and versatile nanocarrier. The work provides valuable insight into the design of mRNA&#8208;DNA origami structures contributing to the development of mRNA&#8208;based gene delivery platforms.

         <title>Win&#8211;Win Integration of Genetically Engineered Cellular Nanovesicles with High&#8208;Absorbing Multimodal Phototheranostic Molecules for Boosted Cancer Photo&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel synergistic approach utilizing genetically engineered cancer cellular nanovesicles displaying PD&#8208;1 ligands as both tumor&#8208;targeted nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents, combined with high&#8208;absorbing multimodal AIEgens as phototheranostic module is developed to implement NIR&#8208;II FLI&#8208;PAI&#8208;PTI trimodal imaging while simultaneously improve the efficacy of photo&#8208;immunotherapy for both primary and distant metastatic tumors.









Abstract
Photo&#8208;immunotherapy is one of the most promising cancer treatment strategies. As immunotherapeutic agents, immune checkpoint blockade antibodies against programmed cell death protein 1 (PD&#8208;1) or programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) exhibit substantial potential, but have to face non&#8208;specific distribution and the subsequent immune&#8208;related adverse events. Meanwhile, high&#8208;performance phototheranostic agents concurrently possessing multiple phototheranostic modalities and high light&#8208;harvesting capacity are really attractive and highly desired as touching phototheranostic modules. Herein, a win&#8211;win strategy that integrates phototheranostic molecule design and targeted immunotherapeutic module preparation is developed to construct high&#8208;powered photo&#8208;immunotherapy systems. Specifically, the phototheranostic agent (AOTTIT) displaying typical aggregation&#8208;induced fluorescence extending to the second near&#8208;infrared II window, as well as outstanding reactive oxygen species and heat production capacity is first obtained via ingenious design. Notably, AOTTIT exhibits a record high molar extinction coefficient among the reported organic multimodal phototheranostic molecules. Meanwhile, PD&#8208;1 genetically engineered cancer cell membrane&#8208;derived nanovesicles (PD&#8208;1/CMNVs) are prepared as both nanocarriers and immunotherapeutic agents to camouflage AOTTIT nanoparticles, yielding a multifunctional photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic agent (CMNPs/PD&#8208;1) with tumor&#8208;specific active and homologous targeting ability. The distinct suppression of primary and metastatic lung tumors after only once treatment to the primary tumor substantiated the synergistically strengthened photo&#8208;immunotherapeutic efficiency of this win&#8208;win strategy.

Nanoporous silver microparticles with noncontaminated surfaces have promising applications in surface&#8208;enhanced Raman scattering sensing fields. A method is developed to transform the electrodeposited Ag7O8NO3 microparticles into nanoporous Ag microparticles at room temperature within minutes without using organic ligands. The size of the interconnected nanopores can be controlled from less than 20 nm to more than 110 nm.








Abstract
Nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with noncontaminated surfaces hold significant promise in catalytic and sensing fields. Fabrication of nanoporous metal microparticles without using any organic ligands remains a significant challenge. Here, a green synthesis strategy is presented inspired by dealloying mechanisms. Ag7O8NO3 microparticles are first electrodeposited. Subsequent chemical reduction process selectively removes nitrogen and oxygen species from the Ag7O8NO3 microparticles while preserving the original morphology, giving rise to the formation of nanoporous Ag microparticles without using organic agents under room temperature within several minutes. Based on the ion diffusion limited growth mechanism, a quantitative correlation is established between the opening size of the nanopores and the concentration of the reductive agents, allowing to rationally prepare nanopores with opening size ranging from &lt;&#160;20&#160;nm to &gt;&#160;110&#160;nm. The ultraclean surface of the nanoporous Ag microparticles guarantees a clean surface&#8208;enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) background. Reliable and sensitive SERS detection of proteins by unfolding the protein structure is further demonstrated to expose the otherwise concealed parts to the nanoporous Ag microparticles. A simple but powerful approach is developed to design ultraclean nanoporous metallic microarchitectures with promising applications in those fields requiring clean surfaces, such as in SERS sensing and catalytic fields.

         <title>Plasma Membrane Targeted Photodynamic Nanoagonist to Potentiate Immune Checkpoint Blockade Therapy by Initiating Tumor Cell Pyroptosis and Depleting Infiltrating B Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist called PMTPN is designed to target tumor tissues and anchor on plasma membrane, aiming to initiate tumor cell pyroptosis and deplete infiltrating B cells. Consequently, PMTPN promotes DCs maturation and CTLs infiltration, while decreasing Tregs, greatly reversing the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment to potentiate immune checkpoint blockade therapy for primary and distant tumor eradication.








Abstract
Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) therapy has achieved remarkable benefits in the treatment of malignant tumors, but the clinical response rates are unsatisfied due to the low tumor immunogenicity and the abundant immunosuppressive cells. Herein, a plasma membrane targeted photodynamic nanoagonist (designated as PMTPN) is developed to potentiate ICB therapy by initiating tumor cell pyroptosis and depleting infiltrating B cells. PMTPN is composed of a rationally designed chimeric peptide sequence loaded with Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor (Ibrutinib). Notably, PMTPN is capable of sequentially targeting tumor and tumor cell membrane to trigger immunogenic pyroptosis and cause overwhelming release of cytokines, promoting dendritic cells maturation, and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) activation. Meanwhile, PMTPN can also deplete infiltrating B cells and reduce the secretion of interleukin&#8208;10 to decrease immunosuppressive regulatory T cells and enhance CTLs infiltration. Beneficially, the synergistic immune modulating characteristics of PMTPN potentiate ICB therapy to simultaneously eliminate primary and distant tumors. This study offers a promising strategy to elevate the immunotherapeutic response rate in consideration of the complex immunosuppressive factors.

         <title>Printing Multi&#8208;Layered Functional Devices Using One Stamp with Programmable Surface Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multi&#8208;layered printed electronics are generally fabricated by overprinting with multiple stamps. Herein, a novel printing approach is introduced by modifying stamp with patterned surface energy. This enables the fabrication of multiple functional layers using only one stamp. Using this method, the fabrication of flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;denstiy transistor array are demonstrated (with over 17,900 transistors on an 8&#8208;inch wafer).








Abstract
Beyond its role in cultural communication, printing technology has emerged as one of the most important approaches to distributing and patterning functional materials for advanced manufacturing. In a printing process, a stamp is employed to transfer functional inks to a target surface, generating a specific pattern that exactly replicates the stamp. Through precise manipulation of different inkdrops, herein, a &#8220;one stamp, diverse patterns&#8221; printing strategy is developed and achieves deposition of varied patterns utilizing a single stamp. This stamp features patterned surface energy, achieved through regioselective energy injection treatment of an ultralow surface energy solid. It is revealed that inks with different surface tensions&#160;can selectively exhibit Cassie or Wenzel state on the stamp to generate diverse ink distributions, which enables the printing of distinct patterns on target surfaces. Leveraging this approach, flexible light&#8208;emitting devices and high&#8208;density transistor array are successfully printed using single stamps. These findings advance the understanding of finely tuning and patterning surface energy for precise liquid manipulation and offer a leap forward in efficient and versatile printing methodology that will boost the innovative integration of functional materials in a simplified manner.

         <title>Advanced 3D Food Printing with Simultaneous Cooking and Generative AI Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in&#8208;situ heating solution for 3D food printing is developed by incorporating noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources during the printing process. This technique ensures food quality control and reduces microbial contamination. The AI&#8208;generated 3D food shape design allows users to create digital models using text input without prior computational skills.








Abstract
3D food printing is an indispensable technology for emerging food technologies. However, conventional nonconcurrent postprocessing methods limit the final food quality, including the unappealing nature of food ink modification, imperfections in retaining the desired food shape, and the risk of microbial contamination. Here, an artificial intelligence (AI)&#8208;enhanced solution is developed to achieve extrusion&#8208;based printing with simultaneous infrared heating, enabling in&#8208;line and rapid cooking of complex starch&#8208;based food. Noncontact graphene heaters as cooking sources present outstanding food quality control with microbial studies, microstructure analysis, and heat transfer simulation models. This integrative 3D food printing method with AI&#8208;enhanced food pattern generation and in&#8208;situ cooking significantly expands the applications for customized food creation. It paves the way for the broader adoption of heating&#8208;based 3D printing of functional materials.

         <title>Buckle&#8208;Barrel Correspondence Based on Topological Polarization Conversion in Mechanical Metamaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In article number XXXX, Jingyi Zhang, Johan Christensen, and co&#8208;workers take a mechanical metamaterial approach to study topological transitions in the context of complex deformations. A buckle&#8208;barrel correspondence has been established that links local polarization conversions to global instabilities.








Abstract
Harnessing instabilities in architected lattices and metamaterials allows for controlled nonlinear deformations, enabling desired mechanical functions like shape morphing and energy absorption. By precisely tailoring instabilities such as buckling into the structure, deformations become a powerful instrument rather than a failure mode, offering new possibilities for predictable responses to mechanical loads. Inspired by the bulk&#8208;boundary correspondence in condensed matter physics, an analogous relationship is explored in metamaterials, where the underlying topology dictates whether the structure under load buckles or barrels. The underlying mechanism that originates from a polarization conversion in the elementary beam network is discussed. Moreover, these predictions, which can be extended to more complex topologies and higher dimensions, showcase that a mode inversion process governs both global deformations and the orientation of localized shear strains within the bulk. It is anticipated that the buckle&#8208;barrel correspondence can be extended to non&#8208;Hookean materials, paving the way for predicting the onset and evolution of true&#160;failure.

         <title>17.68% Efficiency Nonhalogenated Solvent&#8208;Processed Organic Solar Cell Modules Driven by Seed Crystal Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's J&#8211;V curve (right) highlights the transition from small&#8208;area cells to industrial&#8208;scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.








Abstract
Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small&#8208;area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High&#8208;boiling, non&#8208;halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)&#8208;modified small&#8208;molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF&#8208;CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6.

Small&#8208;area toluene&#8208;processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &gt;10 cm2 to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large&#8208;scale production of efficient, large&#8208;area organic solar cell modules.

&lt;p&gt;The TOC illustration depicts asymmetric BDTF-CA2O seed crystals (left) harnessing low nucleation barrier and strong crystallinity to facilitate PM6 crystallization. The module's &lt;i&gt;J&lt;/i&gt;&#8211;&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt; curve (right) highlights the transition from small-area cells to industrial-scale modules, emphasizing the seed crystal strategy's role in achieving uniform morphology and record efficiencies.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Organic solar cells now surpass 20% efficiency in small-area devices, but the use of chloroform as a solvent poses industrial scalability challenges because of its limited ability of uniform film formation and toxicity. High-boiling, non-halogenated solvents are being studied as alternatives, but their low solubility and slow evaporation complicate crystallization process. Here, the study introduces a seed crystal strategy by incorporating oligo (ethylene glycol)-modified small-molecule donors to optimize the nucleation and crystallization. The asymmetric BDTF-CA2O molecule, which combines the strong crystallinity of rodanine group and the low nucleation barrier of oligo (ethylene glycol) chain, significantly promotes the crystallization of the polymer donor PM6. Moreover, BDTF-CA2O effectively suppresses excessive phase separation, and optimizes vertical distribution, resulting in enhanced exciton extraction, balanced carrier transport, and reduced recombination losses. Small-area toluene-processed devices achieve a power conversion efficiency of 19.67%. In the realm of large-area organic solar cell modules, this strategy leads to a record active area efficiency of 17.68% and aperture area efficiency of 16.80% (certified at 16.26%), which is the highest reported for organic solar cell modules &amp;gt;10 cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to date. These achievements highlight the potential of the seed crystal strategy for large-scale production of efficient, large-area organic solar cell modules.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Multi&#8208;material Volumetric Bioprinting and Plug&#8208;and&#8208;play Suspension Bath Biofabrication via Bioresin Molecular Weight Tuning and via Multiwavelength Alignment Optics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Multimaterial volumetric and embedded extrusion bioprinting of complex cell&#8208;laden architectures is enabled by unravelling the interplay between molecular weight and degree of functionalization in gelatin&#8208;based bioresins. Tomographic light&#8208;responsive support baths for suspended printing can be easily generated from single component materials. Molecular weight tuning produces a library of printable hydrogels matching the viscoleasticity properties of native tissues, influencing cell self&#8208;organization.








Abstract
Volumetric Bioprinting (VBP), enables to rapidly build complex, cell&#8208;laden hydrogel constructs for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Light&#8208;based tomographic manufacturing enables spatial&#8208;selective polymerization of a bioresin, resulting in higher throughput and resolution than what is achieved using traditional techniques. However, methods for multi&#8208;material printing are needed for broad VBP adoption and applicability. Although converging VBP with extrusion bioprinting in support baths offers a novel, promising solution, further knowledge on the engineering of hydrogels as light&#8208;responsive, volumetrically printable baths is needed. Therefore, this study investigates the tuning of gelatin macromers, in particular leveraging the effect of molecular weight and degree of modification, to overcome these challenges, creating a library of materials for VBP and Embedded extrusion Volumetric Printing (EmVP). Bioresins with tunable printability and mechanical properties are produced, and a novel subset of gelatins and GelMA exhibiting stable shear&#8208;yielding behavior offers a new, single&#8208;component, ready&#8208;to&#8208;use suspension medium for in&#8208;bath printing, which is stable over multiple hours without needing temperature control. As a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept biological application, bioprinted gels are tested with insulin&#8208;producing pancreatic cell lines for 21 days of culture. Leveraging a multi&#8208;color printer, complex multi&#8208;material and multi&#8208;cellular geometries are produced, enhancing the accessibility of volumetric printing for advanced tissue models.

         <title>Quantum Batteries: A Materials Science Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective is focused on advanced materials that might allow the new device class of quantum batteries to be developed. These systems include microcavities with organic molecules, inorganic nanostructures and perovskites, and superconductor circuits. The different systems proposed are introduced and discussed, and an overview of the potential material platforms for the experimental realization is presented.








Abstract
In the context of quantum thermodynamics, quantum batteries have emerged as promising devices for energy storage and manipulation. Over the past decade, substantial progress is made in understanding the fundamental properties of quantum batteries, with several experimental implementations showing great promise. This perspective provides an overview of the solid&#8208;state materials platforms that can lead to fully operational quantum batteries. After briefly introducing the basic features of quantum batteries, organic microcavities are discussed, where superextensive charging is already demonstrated experimentally. Now, this explores other materials, including inorganic nanostructures (such as quantum wells and dots), perovskite systems, and (normal and high&#8208;temperature) superconductors. Key achievements in these areas, relevant to the experimental realization of quantum batteries, are highlighted. The challenges and future research directions are also addressed. Despite their enormous potential for energy storage devices, research into advanced materials for quantum batteries is still in its infancy. This paper aims to stimulate interdisciplinarity and convergence among different materials science research communities to accelerate the development of new materials and device architectures for quantum batteries.

         <dc:description>
Engineered lipid vesicles, powered by enzyme&#8208;driven symmetry breaking and transient lipid ordering, demonstrate rotational and translational motion. This innovative approach presents exciting possibilities for biomedical applications, particularly in targeted drug delivery.








Abstract
Self&#8208;propelled lipid&#8208;based artificial cells that can achieve controlled rotation and directed translation present significant potential for biomedical applications, yet their engineering poses considerable challenges. Lipid vesicles synthesized via solution&#8208;based methods naturally adopt isotropic spherical shapes. Active motion of these spherical objects requires symmetry breaking and rigidity. In this study, giant vesicles are employed as chassis, utilizing enzymes that undergo cyclic, non&#8208;reciprocal conformational changes as power sources. Weak, transient protein&#8208;protein interactions induce lipid ordering leading to rigidity and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Upon activation of enzyme reactions, these spherical vesicles demonstrate a variety of motion patterns, from pure spinning to 3D spiral trajectories. From experiments and simulations, it is demonstrated how such motion enables the vesicles to cross complex barriers. By utilizing biocompatible and scalable materials, The methodology establishes a solid framework for the design of such self&#8208;propelled systems. The work paves the way for advancements in biomedical and environmental technologies such as targeted drug delivery and active matter research.

This work deciphers the fundamental factors and proposes a general design rule for screening hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;elimination additives. The cherry&#8208;picked additive according to this rule enables a remarkable success in protecting electrodes and interphases over high&#8208;voltage LIBs.









Abstract
Hydrogen fluoride (HF)&#8208;induced degradation of electrode materials and interphases presents a significant challenge for high&#8208;voltage Li&#8208;ion batteries. However, progress in developing advanced HF&#8208;scavenging additives is hindered by a limited understanding of HF&#8208;elimination reactions and the absence of a robust design principle. Herein, it is proposed to analyze the energy decomposition analysis of 24 additives to elucidate the underlying HF&#8208;scavenging mechanism and identify key factors influencing HF&#8208;additives reactions. The findings reveal that orbital contribution ratio (OCR) is a critical determinant of chemical bonding in HF&#8208;additive reactions. Specifically, an 80% OCR for H+ and a 53% OCR for F&#8722; are essential for completing HF elimination. Based on these insights, a general principle for designing effective HF&#8208;elimination additives is proposed and heptamethyldisilazane as a particularly well&#8208;suited candidate, exhibiting optimal OCR for both H+ and F&#8722; ions is identified. Remarkably, the addition of just 1&#160;wt.% HMDS significantly eliminats HF, inhibiting cathode&#8208;to&#8208;anode crosstalk behaviors and limiting electrode and interphase degradation. This guardian endows graphite/LiNi0.8Co0.1Mn0.1O2 pouch cells with a significant performance improvement, achieving 80% capacity retention over 2528 cycles, a substantial improvement compared to the 1139 cycles observed without HF&#8208;elimination additive. The study provides valuable insights for the design of advanced electrolyte additives for high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;ion batteries.

Emphasis is placed on how molecular architecture, processing methods, and fabrication technologies converge to yield materials with tunable mechanical properties, dynamic responsiveness, and enhanced transport behaviors for diverse biomedical and technological applications. The unified approach guides future hydrogel developments.









Abstract
Biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels offer versatility in biomedical engineering due to their abundance, biocompatibility, tailorable properties, and environmental responsiveness. Realizing their full potential requires understanding the molecular&#8208;level design principles that govern their macroscopic behavior. This review analyzes recent advances in the molecular engineering of biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels, emphasizing innovative network design strategies and processing methods for precise control over material properties and functions. How molecular design influences hydrogel behavior across multiple length scales are explored, focusing on: 1) network design strategies: approaches like double networks, interpenetrating networks, and supramolecular assemblies to tailor mechanical and responsive properties; 2) processing techniques: methods such as Hofmeister effect&#8208;induced chain aggregating, cononsolvency&#8208;based porous structure controlling, and directional freezing&#8208;induced network alignment to achieve hierarchical and anisotropic structures. How these design principles and processing methods influence critical hydrogel properties like mechanical strength, inner mass transportation, and degradation are discussed. The review also covers advanced fabrication techniques that leverage these molecular engineering approaches to create complex, functional hydrogels. By elucidating the relationships between molecular architecture, processing methods, and resulting material properties, this work aims to provide a framework for designing next&#8208;generation biopolymer&#8208;based hydrogels with enhanced performance and functionality across various applications.

         <title>Redox&#8208;Active Metal&#8208;Covalent Organic Frameworks for Dendrite&#8208;Free Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>

Two MCOFs with dual&#8208;active centers are designed as LMB separators to enable efficient Li plating/stripping. Synergistic effects between trinuclear copper clusters and electron&#8208;donating diarylamine nitrogen create an electron&#8208;rich environment, regulating the local conjugated Li+ microenvironment. The designed Li symmetric cell exhibits excellent Li plating/stripping stability for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
Lithium (Li) metal has gained attention as an anode material for lithium&#8208;metal batteries (LMBs) owing to its low electrochemical potential, high specific capacity, and low density. However, the accumulation of Li dendrites and unstable solid electrolyte interphases, caused by sluggish Li+ migration and uneven Li deposition, limit practical LMB applications. This study presents the first report on redox&#8208;active metal&#8211;covalent organic frameworks (MCOFs) with dual&#8208;active centers as functional separators for LMBs. These MCOFs facilitate homogeneous Li nucleation and accelerate Li+ ion transport. The synergistic effects of redox&#8208;active diarylamine units and trinuclear copper clusters modulate local electron&#8208;cloud density, regulating microenvironment of Li+ ions and ensuring homogeneous Li nucleation. The MCOF&#8208;based separator's well&#8208;defined 1D channels in MCOF&#8208;based separator enable uniform Li+ flux, and promote homogeneous Li deposition, resulting in high Li+ transference number of 0.93 and an ionic conductivity of 2.01 mS cm&#8722;1 at room temperature. The Li|Cu cell demonstrates a low Li nucleation barrier of 16 mV, while the Li symmetric cell exhibits stable Li plating/stripping for over 1600 h at 0.5 mA cm&#8722;2. When coupled with LiFePO4 cathodes, the assembled LMB exhibits stable capacity retention of &#8776;98%. This work paves the way for dendrite&#8208;free Li metal anodes in high&#8208;performance LMBs.

         <title>Colossal Electromechanical Response in Antiferroelectric&#8208;based Nanoscale Multilayers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The careful design of interfaces in PbHfO3&#8208; and PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3&#8208;based multilayer heterostructures results in electromechanical strain &#8776;4.8% for films as thin as 120 nm. Such studies can significantly advance the understanding about electromechanically&#8208;active thin films which can surpass the detrimental effects of substrate&#8208;induced clamping to demonstrate strain values and be implemented in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
The pursuit of smaller, energy&#8208;efficient devices drives the exploration of electromechanically active thin films (&lt;1 &#181;m) to enable micro&#8208; and nano&#8208;electromechanical systems. While the electromechanical response of such films is limited by substrate&#8208;induced mechanical clamping, large electromechanical responses in antiferroelectric and multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures have garnered interest. Here, multilayer thin&#8208;film heterostructures based on antiferroelectric PbHfO3 and ferroelectric PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 overcome substrate clamping to produce electromechanical strains &gt;4.5%. By varying the chemistry of the PbHf1&#8208;xTixO3 layer (x = 0.3&#8208;0.6) it is possible to alter the threshold field for the antiferroelectric&#8208;to&#8208;ferroelectric phase transition, reducing the field required to induce the onset of large electromechanical response. Furthermore, varying the interface density (from 0.008 to 3.1 nm&#8722;1) enhances the electrical&#8208;breakdown field by &gt;450%. Attaining the electromechanical strains does not necessitate creating a new material with unprecedented piezoelectric coefficients, but developing heterostructures capable of withstanding large fields, thus addressing traditional limitations of thin&#8208;film piezoelectrics.

         <title>Electrosynthesis of Urea on High&#8208;Density Ga&#9472;Y Dual&#8208;Atom Catalyst via Cross&#8208;Tuning</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide and nitrate into urea via the C&#8211;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#8211;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate is developed for urea electrosynthesis. Experiments and theories reveal that strong cross&#8208;synergizing coupling between Ga&#8208;Y sites contributed to improving the electrosynthesis performance of urea.








Abstract
Electrochemically converting carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrate (NO3&#8722;) into urea via the C&#9472;N coupling route offers a sustainable alternative to the traditional industrial urea production technology, but it is still limited by poor yield rate, low Faradaic efficiency, and insufficient coupling kinetics. Herein, a high&#8208;density Ga&#9472;Y dual&#8208;atom catalyst is developed with loading up to 14.1 wt.% of Ga and Y supported on N, P&#8208;co&#8208;doped carbon substrate (Ga/Y&#8208;CNP) for urea electrosynthesis. The catalyst facilitates efficient C&#9472;N coupling through co&#8208;reduction of CO2 and NO3&#8722;, resulting in a high urea yield rate of 41.9 mmol h&#8722;1 g&#8722;1 and a Faradaic efficiency of 22.1% at &#8722;1.4 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode. In situ spectroscopy and theoretical calculations&#160;reveal that the superior performance is attributed to the cross&#8208;tuning between adjacent pair Ga&#9472;Y sites, which can mutually optimize their electronic states for facilitating CO2 reduction to *CO at Ga sites and promoting NO3&#8722; conversion to hydroxylamine (*NH2OH) at Y sites, followed by spontaneous coupling of *CO and *NH2OH intermediates at Ga&#9472;Y sites to form C&#9472;N bonds. This work offers a pioneering strategy to manipulate C&#9472;N coupling pathways by cross&#8208;tuning active sites to produce high&#8208;value&#8208;added chemicals.

         <title>Printed High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs for Advanced Non&#8208;Volatile Memristive Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A non&#8208;volatile, printed memristor utilizing a high&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analog (HE&#8208;PBA) sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes is reported, and the conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE&#8208;PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The Na+&#8208;modulated resistive switching strategy may provide valuable insights for addressing the high power consumption and volatile storage issues encountered in other insertion&#8208;type memristors.








Abstract
Non&#8208;volatile memristors dynamically switch between high (HRS) and low resistance states (LRS) in response to electrical stimuli, essential for electronic memories, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence. High&#8208;entropy Prussian blue analogs (HE&#8208;PBAs) are promising insertion&#8208;type battery materials due to their diverse composition, high structural integrity, and favorable ionic conductivity. This work proposes a non&#8208;volatile, bipolar memristor based on HE&#8208;PBA. The device, featuring an active layer of HE&#8208;PBA sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes, is fabricated by inkjet printing and microplotting. The conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE&#8208;PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated.

&lt;p&gt;A non-volatile, printed memristor utilizing a high-entropy Prussian blue analog (HE-PBA) sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes is reported, and the conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE-PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-modulated resistive switching strategy may provide valuable insights for addressing the high power consumption and volatile storage issues encountered in other insertion-type memristors.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Non-volatile memristors dynamically switch between high (HRS) and low resistance states (LRS) in response to electrical stimuli, essential for electronic memories, neuromorphic computing, and artificial intelligence. High-entropy Prussian blue analogs (HE-PBAs) are promising insertion-type battery materials due to their diverse composition, high structural integrity, and favorable ionic conductivity. This work proposes a non-volatile, bipolar memristor based on HE-PBA. The device, featuring an active layer of HE-PBA sandwiched between Ag and ITO electrodes, is fabricated by inkjet printing and microplotting. The conduction mechanism of the Ag/HE-PBA/ITO device is systematically investigated. The results indicate that the transition between HRS and LRS is driven by an insulating-metallic transition, triggered by extraction/insertion of highly mobile Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions upon application of an electric field. The memristor operates through a low-energy process akin to Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; shuttling in Na-ion batteries rather than depending on formation/rupture of Ag filaments. Notably, it showcases promising characteristics, including non-volatility, self-compliance, and forming-free behavior, and further exhibits low operation voltage (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SET&lt;/sub&gt; = &#8722;0.26 V, &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RESET&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.36 V), low power consumption (&lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;SET&lt;/sub&gt; = 26 &#181;W, &lt;i&gt;P&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;RESET&lt;/sub&gt; = 8.0 &#181;W), and a high &lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OFF&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;ON&lt;/sub&gt; ratio of 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. This underscores the potential of high-entropy insertion materials for developing printed memristors with distinct operation mechanisms.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Plasma&#8211;Liquid&#8208;Induced Synthesis of Scandium&#8211;Metalloporphyrin Frameworks for Boosted Sensing and Photosensitization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Solution anode glow discharge (SAGD) plasma is used to synthesize scandium&#8208;metalloporphyrin frameworks (SAGD&#8208;ScMPFs) in one step. SAGD&#8208;ScMPFs exhibit boosted fluorescence sensing ability and good electron&#8211;hole separation efficiency. It has been used for the sensitive detection of fluoride ions and effective bacteriostasis.








Abstract
Inserting metal ions into the porphyrin ring is one of the primary strategies to enhance the properties of porphyrin&#8208;based metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). However, the straightforward, rapid, and energy&#8208;efficient synthesis of porphyrin&#8208;based MOFs with high metallization for the porphyrin ring remains challenging. Herein, a solution anode glow discharge (SAGD) microplasma is presented for the one&#8208;step synthesis of scandium&#8208;metalloporphyrin frameworks (ScMPFs). The substantial number of electrons provided by the plasma&#8211;liquid interface not only accelerated the rapid nucleation and growth of MOFs but also promoted the incorporation of scandium (Sc3+), which has a small ionic radius and strong coordination ability, into the N atoms in the porphyrin ring, and enhanced the metallization of MOFs. The sufficient Sc3+ in frameworks inhibited the recombination of electron&#8211;hole pairs, resulting in boosted reactive oxygen species yield and a low fluorescence background of MOFs. Consequently, the ScMPFs are employed for the sensitive and rapid detection of F&#8722; in water with a detection limit of 0.24 &#181;m and for efficient bacteriostasis at low doses (10 &#181;g&#160;mL&#8722;1, 12&#160;mW&#160;cm&#8722;2 light irradiation for 10&#160;min).

         <title>Electrically Generated Exciton Polaritons with Spin On&#8208;Demand</title>

         <dc:description>
Here, electrical generation and manipulation of highly spin&#8208;polarized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a monolithic dielectric perovskite metasurface embedded in a light&#8208;emitting transistor are demonstrated. The development of light&#8208;emitting polaritonic devices with electrically tunable polarization and directionality is advanced.








Abstract
Generation and manipulation of exciton polaritons with controllable spin could deeply impact spintronic applications, quantum simulations, and quantum information processing, but is inherently challenging due to the charge neutrality of the polariton and the device complexity it requires. Here, electrical generation of spin&#8208;polarized exciton polaritons in a monolithic dielectric perovskite metasurface embedded in a light&#8208;emitting transistor is demonstrated. A finely tailored interplay of in&#8208; and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane symmetry breaking of the metasurface allows to lift the spin degeneracy through the polaritonic Rashba effect, yielding high spin purity with normalized Stokes parameter of S3&#160;&#8776;&#160;0.8. Leveraging on spin&#8208;momentum locking, the unique metatransistor device architecture enables electrical control of spin and directionality of the polaritonic emission. Here, the development of compact and tunable spintronic devices is advanced and an important step toward the realization of electrically pumped inversionless spin&#8208;lasers is represented.

Abstract
Characterization of electromagnetic wave polarization states is critical in various applications of materials, biomedical, and imaging. The emergence of metasurfaces opens up the possibility of implementing highly integrated full&#8208;Stokes imagers. Despite rapid development, prevailing schemes on metasurface&#8208;based full&#8208;Stokes imagers require interleaved or cascaded designs, inevitably resulting in performance deterioration, bulky size, and complicating the imaging procedure due to misalignment. To overcome these challenges, a non&#8208;interleaved shared&#8208;aperture full&#8208;Stokes metalens enabled by the prior&#8208;knowledge&#8208;driven inverse design methodology is proposed. The metalens can be directly deployed into imagers, performing high&#8208;accuracy diffraction&#8208;limited full&#8208;Stokes imaging without other ancillary components, breaking intrinsic constraints of efficiency and resolution in interleaved design. To demonstrate this, the metalens is integrated into the W&#8208;band passive imaging system, as an alternative solution, to perform polarimetric imaging, which reduces the reliance on the high cost and high complexity of the ortho&#8208;mode transducer and broadband correlator in traditional polarimetric radiometers. Furthermore, with the assistance of a 3D reconstruction method, the feasibility of multi&#8208;polarization information for contactless surface slope measurements is explored. This work may open new paradigms for the full&#8208;Stokes imager designing and broaden the applications of metasurface polarimetric imaging.

         <title>Energy Band Alignment and Defect Synergistic Regulation Enable Air&#8208;Solution&#8208;Processed Kesterite Solar Cells With the Lowest VOC Deficit</title>

Synergistic substitution of Ag and In cations simultaneously solves the problems of undesirable interface band alignment and high&#8208;density deleterious bulk defects to minimize the open circuit voltage deficit (VOC) deficit.








Abstract
The major challenge in preparing high&#8208;performance Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 solar cells is the large open circuit voltage deficit (VOC&#8208;def). A new strategy utilizing the synergistic substitution of Ag and In dual cations has been proposed to simultaneously address the problems of undesirable interface band alignment and high&#8208;density detrimental bulk defects, obtaining decreased carrier recombination rate and increased minority carrier lifetime. The shorter In&#8722;S/Se bonds move the CBM higher by generating stronger repulsive force than the Sn&#8722;S/Se bonds, thus adjusting the interface band alignment. Ag substitution can effectively suppress Cu&#9472;Zn disorder, while Ag, In dual substitution can further passivate Sn&#8208;related defects and solve the issue of low carrier concentration in Ag single&#8208;substituted samples. Besides, the superior carrier property of In&#8208;Se materials significantly enhanced the device carrier lifetime and minority carrier diffusion length. The state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art air&#8208;solution&#8208;processed CZTSSe device without any addition treatment with 14.33% efficiency and 580&#160;mV VOC is obtained, possessing the lowest VOC&#8208;def value currently available in the CZTSSe field (VOC/VOCSQ = 64.7%). This work emphasizes the synergistic modulation of band alignment, defect level, grain growth, and carrier transportation by dual cation substitution, which paves a convenient and effective way to realize high&#8208;performance solar cells and photovoltaic devices.

&lt;p&gt;The major challenge in preparing high-performance Cu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnSn(S,Se)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solar cells is the large open circuit voltage deficit (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;-def). A new strategy utilizing the synergistic substitution of Ag and In dual cations has been proposed to simultaneously address the problems of undesirable interface band alignment and high-density detrimental bulk defects, obtaining decreased carrier recombination rate and increased minority carrier lifetime. The shorter In&#8722;S/Se bonds move the CBM higher by generating stronger repulsive force than the Sn&#8722;S/Se bonds, thus adjusting the interface band alignment. Ag substitution can effectively suppress Cu&#9472;Zn disorder, while Ag, In dual substitution can further passivate Sn-related defects and solve the issue of low carrier concentration in Ag single-substituted samples. Besides, the superior carrier property of In-Se materials significantly enhanced the device carrier lifetime and minority carrier diffusion length. The state-of-the-art air-solution-processed CZTSSe device without any addition treatment with 14.33% efficiency and 580&#160;mV &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt; is obtained, possessing the lowest &lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;-def value currently available in the CZTSSe field (&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;/&lt;i&gt;V&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;OC&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;SQ&lt;/sup&gt; = 64.7%). This work emphasizes the synergistic modulation of band alignment, defect level, grain growth, and carrier transportation by dual cation substitution, which paves a convenient and effective way to realize high-performance solar cells and photovoltaic devices.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Mechanical&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Driven Pseudo&#8208;Conductive Channels
This cover illustrates the development of a mechanical stimulus&#8208;driven pseudo&#8208;conductive channel (MSPC). The device, composed of two dielectric sheets, utilizes a triboelectric effect triggered by hand contact. This forms an MSPC between the layers, enabling electrical signal transmission, visualized by the illuminated light bulb. It effectively simplifies the complex concept of MSPC for broader understanding. More details can be found in article number 2416952 by Xinqi Chen, Run Hu, Wonjoon Choi, and co&#8208;workers.

High&#8208;Entropy Prussian Blue Analogs
In article number 2410060 by Ben Breitung, Jasmin Aghassi&#8208;Hagmann, and co&#8208;workers, high&#8208;entropy metal organic frameworks (HE&#8208;MOFs) are employed as the active layer in sodium&#8208;modulated, non&#8208;volatile, printed memristors. These memristors exhibit low power consumption, self&#8208;compliance, and forming&#8208;free behavior, ideal for memory applications. The resistivity changes during operation arise from an insulating&#8208;metallic transition, driven by the distribution of sodium ions within the material. By leveraging the low&#8208;energy process of ion (de)insertion combined with a silver (Ag) electrode, the Ag/HE&#8208;MOF/ITO device demonstrates robust retention stability and a high ROFF/RON ratio, making it an efficient non&#8208;volatile memristor.

Electrical Injection Polaritons
Generation and manipulation of exciton&#8208;polaritons with controllable spin is inherently challenging due to polaritons charge neutrality and device complexity. The electrical generation and tunability of spin&#8208;polarized exciton&#8208;polaritons in a perovskite light&#8208;emitting metatransistor represents an important step toward the development of compact spintronic devices and electrically pumped inversionless spin&#8208;lasers, with deep impact in spintronic and quantum applications. More details can be found in article number 2412952 by Cesare Soci and co&#8208;workers.

Mixed Ionic&#8208;Electronic Conductors
The article number 2414963 by Christopher J Takacs, Elsa Reichmanis, and co&#8208;workers offers comprehensive understanding of electrochemical doping, revealing how side&#8208;chain chemistry governs ion uptake and swelling behavior in organic mixed conductors (OMIECs). COOH functionalities enable dual ion interactions during p&#8208;channel doping/charge compensation, while ester alternatives drive strictly anion uptake. These insights emphasize the importance of polymer&#8208;ion&#8208;water systems and multimodal characterization to optimize OMIEC performance and conduction mechanisms.

&lt;p&gt;The article number &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1002/adma.202414963"&gt;2414963&lt;/a&gt; by Christopher J Takacs, Elsa Reichmanis, and co-workers offers comprehensive understanding of electrochemical doping, revealing how side-chain chemistry governs ion uptake and swelling behavior in organic mixed conductors (OMIECs). COOH functionalities enable dual ion interactions during p-channel doping/charge compensation, while ester alternatives drive strictly anion uptake. These insights emphasize the importance of polymer-ion-water systems and multimodal characterization to optimize OMIEC performance and conduction mechanisms.

         <title>Transition of Perovskite Solar Technologies to Being Flexible</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses challenges in material science, stability, and scalability for the transition of perovskite solar technology from rigid to flexible, emphasizes robust encapsulation, and proposes protocols for mechanical stability, which is crucial for their commercialization. The flexible perovskite PV technologies will enable new possibilities by integration into diverse technologies.








Abstract
Perovskite technologies has taken giant steps on its advances in only a decade time, from fundamental science to device engineering. The possibility to exploit this technology on a thin flexible substrate gives an unbeatable power to weight ratio compares to similar photovoltaic systems, opening new possibilities and new integration concepts, going from building integrated and applied photovoltaics (BIPV, BAPV) to internet of things (IoT). In this perspective, the recent progress of perovskite solar technologies on flexible substrates are summarized, focusing on the challenges that researchers face upon using flexible substrates. A dig into material science is necessary to understand what kind of mechanisms are limiting its efficiency compare to rigid substrates, and which physical mechanism limits the upscaling on flexible substrate. Furthermore, an overview of stability test on flexible modules will be described, suggesting common standard procedure and guidelines to follow, showing additional issues that flexible modules face upon bending, and how to prevent device degradation providing an ad&#8208;hoc encapsulation. Finally, the recent advances of flexible devices in the perovskite market will be shown, giving an outline of how this technology is exploited on flexible substrates, and what are still missing that need stakeholders&#8217; attention.

         <title>Multiscale Understanding of Anion Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells: Mechanisms, Electrocatalysts, Polymers, and Cell Management</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are a promising sustainable electrochemical technology with potential applications in aircraft, submarines, vehicles, etc. This review aims to provide an overview of recent advances in AEMFCs by examining four key aspects: reaction mechanisms, electrochemical catalysts, anion exchange polymers, and fuel cell management, covering from microscale to macroscale.








Abstract
Anion exchange membrane fuel cells (AEMFCs) are among the most promising sustainable electrochemical technologies to help solve energy challenges. Compared to proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs), AEMFCs offer a broader choice of catalyst materials and a less corrosive operating environment for the bipolar plates and the membrane. This can lead to potentially lower costs and longer operational life than PEMFCs. These significant advantages have made AEMFCs highly competitive in the future fuel cell market, particularly after advancements in developing non&#8208;platinum&#8208;group&#8208;metal anode electrocatalysts, anion exchange membranes and ionomers, and in understanding the relationships between cell operating conditions and mass transport in AEMFCs. This review aims to compile recent literature to provide a comprehensive understanding of AEMFCs in three key areas: i) the mechanisms of the hydrogen oxidation reaction (HOR) and the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) in alkaline media; ii) recent advancements in the synthesis routes and structure&#8208;property relationships of cutting&#8208;edge HOR and ORR electrocatalysts, as well as anion exchange membranes and ionomers; and iii) fuel cell operating conditions, including water management and impact of CO2. Finally, based on these aspects, the future development and perspectives of AEMFCs are proposed.

Abstract
Implantable medical electronic devices (IMEDs) have attracted great attention and shown versatility for solving clinical problems ranging from real&#8208;time monitoring of physiological/ pathological states to electrical stimulation therapy and from monitoring brain cell activity to deep brain stimulation. The ongoing challenge is to select appropriate materials in target device configuration for biomedical applications. Currently, silk&#8208;based biomaterials have been developed for the design of diagnostic and therapeutic electronic devices due to their excellent properties and abundant active sites in the structure. Herein, the aim is to summarize the structural characteristics, physicochemical properties, and bioactivities of natural silk biomaterials as well as their derived materials, with a particular focus on the silk&#8208;based implantable biomedical electronic devices, such as implantable devices for invasive brain&#8208;computer interfaces, neural recording, and in vivo electrostimulation. In addition, future opportunities and challenges are also envisioned, hoping to spark the interests of researchers in interdisciplinary fields such as biomaterials, clinical medicine, and electronics.

         <title>Advanced Polymeric Nanoparticles for Cancer Immunotherapy: Materials Engineering, Immunotherapeutic Mechanism and Clinical Translation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here recent advances in engineered polymeric nano&#8208;paradigms that are uniquely suited to enhance the therapeutic efficacy of cancer immunotherapy while decreasing the immune response associated toxicity are discussed and highlighted. The viewpoint on this emerging field lying at the interface of polymeric chemistry/material science and cancer immunology for accelerating clinical translation is provided.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy, which leverages immune system components to treat malignancies, has emerged as a cornerstone of contemporary therapeutic strategies. Yet, critical concerns about the efficacy and safety of cancer immunotherapies remain formidable. Nanotechnology, especially polymeric nanoparticles (PNPs), offers unparalleled flexibility in manipulation&#8208;from the chemical composition and physical properties to the precision control of nanoassemblies. PNPs provide an optimal platform to amplify the potency and minimize systematic toxicity in a broad spectrum of immunotherapeutic modalities. In this comprehensive review, the basics of polymer chemistry, and state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art designs of PNPs from a physicochemical standpoint for cancer immunotherapy, encompassing therapeutic cancer vaccines, in situ vaccination, adoptive T&#8208;cell therapies, tumor&#8208;infiltrating immune cell&#8208;targeted therapies, therapeutic antibodies, and cytokine therapies are delineated. Each immunotherapy necessitates distinctively tailored design strategies in polymeric nanoplatforms. The extensive applications of PNPs, and investigation of their mechanisms of action for enhanced efficacy are particularly focused on. The safety profiles of PNPs and clinical research progress are discussed. Additionally, forthcoming developments and emergent trends of polymeric nano&#8208;immunotherapeutics poised to transform cancer treatment paradigms into clinics are explored.

         <title>Designing Current Collectors to Stabilize Li Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the design principles and modification strategies of current collectors to improve the reversibility of Li metal anode including lithiophilic site modification is summarized, 3D architecture construction, protective layer modification, and crystalline plane engineering. How these approaches contribute is highlighted and the prospects are prospected.








Abstract
Rechargeable batteries employing Li metal anodes have gained increasing attention due to their high energy density. Nevertheless, low stability and reversibility of Li metal anodes severely impeded their practical applications. Designing current collectors (CCs) with reasonable structure and composition is an efficient approach to stabilizing the Li metal anodes. However, an in&#8208;depth comprehensive understanding about the design principles and modification strategies of CCs for realizing stable Li metal anodes is still lacking. Herein, a critical review focusing on the rational design of CCs for Li metal anodes is summarized. First, the requirements for CCs in Li metal anodes are elucidated to clarify the design objectives of CCs. Then, the modification strategies of CCs including lithiophilic site modification, 3D architecture construction, protective layer modification, and crystalline plane engineering, as well as the corresponding principles are highlighted. On this basis, the recent progress in the development of CCs for Li metal anodes is discussed. Finally, future directions are suggested to focus on developing operando monitoring technology, and designing the CCs and cells under practical conditions close to the requirements of commercial applications. This review will spur more insightful researches toward advanced CCs, and promote their commercialization.

         <title>MOF&#8208;derived Carbon&#8208;Based Materials for Energy&#8208;Related Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review systematically summarizes the latest advances in the tailored types, processing strategies, and energy&#8208;related applications of MOF&#8208;derived carbon&#8208;based materials and focuses on the structure&#8208;activity relationship between the structure of pure carbon, heteroatom&#8208;doped carbon, metal&#8208;doped carbon, and metallide&#8208;doped carbon and their electrochemical properties.








Abstract
New carbon&#8208;based materials (CMs) are recommended as attractively active materials due to their diverse nanostructures and unique electron transport pathways, demonstrating great potential for highly efficient energy storage applications, electrocatalysis, and beyond. Among these newly reported CMs, metal&#8211;organic framework (MOF)&#8208;derived CMs have achieved impressive development momentum based on their high specific surface areas, tunable porosity, and flexible structural&#8208;functional integration. However, obstacles regarding the integrity of porous structures, the complexity of preparation processes, and the precise control of active components hinder the regulation of precise interface engineering in CMs. In this context, this review systematically summarizes the latest advances in tailored types, processing strategies, and energy&#8208;related applications of MOF&#8208;derived CMs and focuses on the structure&#8208;activity relationship of metal&#8208;free carbon, metal&#8208;doped carbon, and metallide&#8208;doped carbon. Particularly, the intrinsic correlation and evolutionary behavior between the synergistic interaction of micro/nanostructures and active species with electrochemical performances are emphasized. Finally, unique insights and perspectives on the latest relevant research are presented, and the future development prospects and challenges of MOF&#8208;derived CMs are discussed, providing valuable guidance to boost high&#8208;performance electrochemical electrodes for a broader range of application fields.

         <title>An Analysis of Components and Enhancement Strategies for Advancing Memristive Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review addresses the limitations of von Neumann architectures and highlights advancements in memristor&#8208;based neural networks (Mem&#8208;NNs). It categorizes Mem&#8208;NNs into preprocessing units, processing units, and learning algorithms, and discusses optimization strategies across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms. Furthermore, it compares recent neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, and outlines current challenges and future directions for enhancing Mem&#8208;NN functionality and reliability.








Abstract
Advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and big data have highlighted the limitations of traditional von Neumann architectures, such as excessive power consumption and limited performance improvement with increasing parameter numbers. These challenges are significant for edge devices requiring higher energy and area efficiency. Recently, many reports on memristor&#8208;based neural networks (Mem&#8208;NN) using resistive switching memory have shown efficient computing performance with a low power requirement. Even further performance optimization can be made using engineering resistive switching mechanisms. Nevertheless, systematic reviews that address the circuit&#8208;to&#8208;material aspects of Mem&#8208;NNs, including their dedicated algorithms, remain limited. This review first categorizes the memristor&#8208;based neural networks into three components: pre&#8208;processing units, processing units, and learning algorithms. Then, the optimization methods to improve integration and operational reliability are discussed across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms for each component. Furthermore, the review compares recent advancements in chip&#8208;level neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, including graphic processing units. The ongoing challenges and future directions in the field are discussed, highlighting the research to enhance the functionality and reliability of Mem&#8208;NNs.

Recently, many reports on memristor-based neural networks (Mem-NN) using resistive switching memory have shown efficient computing performance with a low power requirement. Even further performance optimization can be made using engineering resistive switching mechanisms. Nevertheless, systematic reviews that address the circuit-to-material aspects of Mem-NNs, including their dedicated algorithms, remain limited. This review first categorizes the memristor-based neural networks into three components: pre-processing units, processing units, and learning algorithms. Then, the optimization methods to improve integration and operational reliability are discussed across materials, devices, circuits, and algorithms for each component. Furthermore, the review compares recent advancements in chip-level neuromorphic hardware with conventional systems, including graphic processing units.

         <title>Scalable Synthesis of 2D ErOCl with Sub&#8208;meV Narrow Emissions at Telecom Band</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Centimeter&#8208;size, uniform 2D ErOCl film, and diverse 2D rare&#8208;earth materials are grown using self&#8208;encapsulation strategy. 2D ErOCl possesses high crystalline quality, excellent ambient and thermal stability. 2D ErOCl exhibits outstanding optical properties, featuring sub&#8208;meV narrow emissions at the telecom C&#8208;band. These emissions are tunable with external magnetic fields, highlighting their potential for advanced optical applications.








Abstract
Van der Waals (vdWs) materials are promising candidates for hetero&#8208;integration with silicon photonics toward miniaturization and integration. VdWs materials like molybdenum telluride and black phosphorus, despite being prominent, exhibit air sensitivity, and their room temperature emissions can be significantly broadened by tens of meV. Here, a self&#8208;encapsulation strategy is developed to scalably synthesize robust 2D vdWs ErOCl with sub&#8208;meV narrow emissions at the telecom C&#8208;band. Diverse 2D rare earth materials are also grown via chemical vapor deposition (TmOCl, YbOCl, HoOCl, DyOCl, SmOCl, NdOCl, TbOCl, GdOCl, EuOCl, and PrOCl), demonstrating the strategy's generalizability. The as&#8208;grown ErOCl exhibits high crystalline quality and excellent ambient&#160;and thermal stability (300&#160;&#176;C). Photoluminescence analysis reveals a series of narrow emissions across the visible to near&#8208;infrared spectrum. The ErOCl's emission at the telecom band is narrowest among 2D luminescent materials, and suitable for integrating with photonic chips. Temperature&#8208;dependent photoluminescence spectra facilitate the understanding of emission mechanisms, analyzed using a crystal field perturbation model. Moreover, these emissions can be tuned by external magnetic fields. This research not only pioneers a novel strategy for synthesizing 2D rare earth materials but also paves the way for innovative building blocks in the realm of on&#8208;chip optical communications.

         <title>3D Printed Titanium Scaffolds with Bi&#8208;Directional Gradient QK&#8208;Functionalized Surface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the development of a 3D&#8208;printed modular porous titanium scaffold utilizing a gradient&#8208;surface strategy to immobilize QK peptide with a bi&#8208;directional gradient, characterized by high peptide density in the interior and low density at both ends. This design can effectively promote cell migration from the scaffold ends toward the interior, thereby enhancing vascularization and osteointegration.








Abstract
3D printed titanium scaffold has promising applications in orthopedics. However, the bioinert titanium presents challenges for promoting vascularization and tissue growth within the porous scaffold for stable osteointegration. In this study, a modular porous titanium scaffold is created using 3D printing and a gradient&#8208;surface strategy to immobilize QK peptide on the surface with a bi&#8208;directional gradient distribution. This design featured high peptide density in the interior and low peptide density on both ends, aiming to induce cell migration from ends to interior and subsequently enhance vascularization and osteointegration within the scaffold. In vitro results showed that besides the inherent bioactivity, the gradient distribution of QK positively correlated with endothelial cell migration and promoted angiogenesis. In vivo assay was performed by a segmental bone defect model in rabbit and a spine repair model in sheep. Various staining and Micro&#8208;CT results demonstrated that compared to that with uniformly QK&#8208;functionalized surface, the scaffold with bi&#8208;directional gradient QK&#8208;functionalized surface (Ti&#8208;G) significantly encouraged new tissue growth toward the interior of the scaffold, subsequently facilitated angiogenesis and osteointegration. This study provides an effective strategy for enhancing the bioactivity of peptide&#8208;functionalized scaffolds through the concept of bi&#8208;directional gradients, and holds potential for various 3D printed scaffolds.

         <title>&#954;/&#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 Type&#8208;II Phase Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Researchers have experimentally unveiled a perfect interface between the monoclinic (&#946;)&#8208;phase and orthorhombic (&#954;)&#8208;phase of Ga2O3, establishing a &#8220;phase heterojunction&#8221; within the ultrawide bandgap Ga2O3 material system. This phase heterojunction exhibits a type&#8208;II band alignment with significant band offset, highlighting a large interfacial electrical field, which is verified through the separation of photogenerated electron&#8211;hole pairs, even without external bias.








Abstract
Ultrawide&#8208;bandgap gallium oxide (Ga2O3) holds immense potential for crucial applications such as solar&#8208;blind photonics and high&#8208;power electronics. Although several Ga2O3 polymorphs, i.e., &#945;, &#946;, &#947;, &#948;, &#949;, and &#954; phases, have been identified, the band alignments between these phases have been largely overlooked due to epitaxy challenges and inadvertent neglect. Despite having similar stoichiometry, heterojunctions involving different phases may exhibit band offsets. Here, &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3/&#954;&#8208;Ga2O3&#8208;stacked &#8220;phase heterojunction&#8221; is demonstrated experimentally. This phase heterojunction has a sharp and well&#8208;defined interface, and subsequent measurements reveal an unbeknown type&#8208;II band alignment with significant valence/conduction band offsets of &#8776;0.65&#160;eV/0.71&#160;eV. This alignment is promising for self&#8208;powered deep ultraviolet (DUV) signal detection, necessitating an internal electric field near the junction and matching the absorption properties for effective electron&#8211;hole separation. The fabricated phase heterojunction photodetector displays a responsivity of three orders of magnitude higher at 17.8&#160;mA W&#8722;1, with improved response times (rise time &#8776;0.21 s, decay time &#8776;0.53 s) under DUV illumination and without external bias in comparison to the bare &#946;&#8208;Ga2O3 and &#954;&#8208;Ga2O3 photodetectors, confirming the strong interfacial electrical field. This study provides profound insight into Ga2O3/Ga2O3 heterojunction interfaces with different polymorphs, allowing the use of phase heterojunctions to advance electronic device applications.

         <title>A Bioinspired Virus&#8208;Like Mechano&#8211;Bactericidal Nanomotor for Ocular Multidrug&#8208;Resistant Bacterial Infection Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A biomimetic mechano&#8211;bactericidal nanomotor designed to address ocular multidrug&#8208;resistant bacterial infections by combining spiky topological structures with self&#8208;thermophoresis is developed. The nanomotor demonstrates highly specific targeting of bacteria, effective elimination of bacterial cells, enhanced penetration into biofilms, and excellent biocompatibility. In vivo studies indicate that the mechano&#8211;bactericidal approach delivers outstanding therapeutic results; while, causing minimal side effects.








Abstract
Multidrug&#8208;resistant (MDR) bacteria and their associated biofilms are major causative factors in eye infections, often resulting in blindness and presenting considerable global health challenges. Presently, mechano&#8211;bactericidal systems, which combine distinct topological geometries with mechanical forces to physically induce bacterial apoptosis, show promising potential. However, the physical interaction process between current mechano&#8211;bactericidal systems and bacteria is generally based on passive diffusion or Brownian motion and lacks the force required for biofilm penetration; thus, featuring low antibacterial efficacy. Here, a biomimetic mechano&#8211;bactericidal nanomotor (VMSNT) is synthesized by functionalizing COOH&#8208;PEG&#8208;phenylboronic acid (PBA) on virus&#8208;like mesoporous silica, with subsequent partial coating of Au caps. Enhanced by self&#8208;thermophoresis capabilities and virus&#8208;like topological shapes, VMSNT significantly improves mechanical antibacterial effects and biofilm penetration. In addition, scanning electron microscope (SEM) and confocal laser scanning microscope (CLSM)&#160;analyses demonstrate that VMSNT can precisely target bacteria within the infection microenvironment, facilitated by PBA's ability to recognize and bind to the peptidoglycan on bacterial surfaces. Remarkably, VMSNT is also effective in eliminating MDR bacteria and reducing inflammation in mice models of methicillin&#8208;resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA)&#8208;infected keratitis and endophthalmitis, with minimal adverse effects. Overall, such a nanomotor presents a promising approach for addressing the challenges of ocular MDR bacterial infections.

         <title>Molecular Ferroelectrics for Highly Sensitive Detection Toward Low&#8208;Frequency Sound Recognition</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study represents the first use of molecular ferroelectrics in the construction of a piezoelectric acoustic sensor for low&#8208;frequency sound detection. This piezoelectric acoustic sensor exhibits excellent sensitivity (47.43 mV Pa&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) frequency resolution (up to 0.1 Hz), discrimination, and detection of low&#8208;frequency sounds. This acoustic sensor efficiently captures acoustic signals from various sources, such as heartbeats, music, animal sounds, and voices, and exhibits&#160;superior performance characteristics.








Abstract
Human hearing cannot sensitively detect sounds below 100&#160;Hz, which can affect the physical well&#8208;being and lead to dizziness, headaches, and nausea. Piezoelectric acoustic sensors still lack sensitivity to low&#8208;frequency sounds owing to the low piezoelectric coefficient or high elastic modulus of materials. The low elastic modulus and substantial piezoelectric coefficient of molecular ferroelectric materials make them excellent candidates for acoustic sensors. In this study, the molecular ferroelectric, [(CH3)3NCH2Cl]CdCl3, is used as a piezoelectric active layer in the construction of a piezoelectric acoustic sensor for low&#8208;frequency sound detection. The sensor exhibits high sensitivity (47.43&#160;mV Pa&#8722;1 cm&#8722;2) at 87&#160;Hz, with an excellent level of frequency resolution (up to 0.1&#160;Hz). This facilitates the accurate discrimination and detection of low&#8208;frequency sounds, which is suitable for noise detection applications. The sensor differentiates between various musical instruments and heartbeats, and recognizes audio signals. This study highlights the potential of molecular ferroelectric materials in piezoelectric acoustic device applications, including noise detection, health monitoring, and human&#8208;computer interactions.

         <title>Zero&#8208;Waste Polyanion and Prussian Blue Composites toward Practical Sodium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel mechanochemical approach enables closed&#8208;loop transformation of raw materials into high&#8208;value sodium&#8208;ion battery (SIBs) cathode materials. This &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221;,&#160;solvent&#8208;free process minimizes water use, maximizes material utilization, and simplifies production. The composite, combining Prussian blue analogs and sulfates, demonstrates excellent wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance, with synergy verified by in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations, highlighting its potential for cost&#8208;effective, practical SIBs.








Abstract
Closed&#8208;loop transformation of raw materials into high&#8208;value&#8208;added products is highly desired for the sustainable development of the society but is seldom achieved. Here, a low&#8208;cost, solvent&#8208;free and &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221; mechanochemical protocol is reported for the large&#8208;scale preparation of cathode materials for sodium&#8208;ion batteries (SIBs). This process ensures full utilization of raw materials, effectively reduces water consumption, and simplifies the operating process. Benefiting from the synergistic effect between the cubic Prussian blue analogs (c&#8208;NFFHCF) and dehydrated polyanionic sulfates (m&#8208;NFS), the generated composite exhibits promising wide&#8208;temperature electrochemical performance and excellent practical application potential. The synergistic effect between m&#8208;NFS and c&#8208;NFFHCF in the composite is revealed through multiple in situ characterizations and density functional theory calculations. The proposed mechanochemical strategy can be scaled to a kilogram&#8208;grade level, providing a sustainable method for the value&#8208;added utilization of the by&#8208;products during Prussian blue analogs synthesis, advancing the design of &#8220;zero&#8208;waste&#8221; cathode materials for low&#8208;cost practical SIBs.

         <title>Phytochlorin&#8208;Based Sonosensitizers Combined with Free&#8208;Field Ultrasound for Immune&#8208;Sonodynamic Cancer Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dedicated sonodynamic system with controllable and reproducible conditions provided by free&#8208;field ultrasound is developed for activating phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers. Combined with a detailed step&#8208;by&#8208;step sonodynamic process, this work acts as a powerful guide for applying the sonodynamic technique, facilitating sonodynamic research from laboratory to clinical application.








Abstract
Phytochlorins, a class of plant&#8208;derived tetrapyrroles, show great potential as sonosensitizers in sonodynamic therapy (SDT). The development of new phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers has significantly improved SDT, yet the absence of specialized sonodynamic systems limits their clinical translation. Herein, a dedicated ultrasound system along with a detailed step&#8208;by&#8208;step sonodynamic process from in vitro to in vivo is developed to activate phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers. Compared to standing&#8208;wave ultrasound, free&#8208;field ultrasound maintains stable acoustic pressure amplitudes and minimizes mechanical damage to cell membranes. In vitro experiments demonstrate that free&#8208;field ultrasound effectively activates naturally occurring phytochlorin, reducing the cavitation threshold for reactive oxygen species production and triggering immunogenic cell death. Furthermore, the intravenously injectable phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizer (C34) enhances sonodynamic efficiency by reducing interfacial tension. Driven by in vivo free&#8208;field ultrasound, C34 effectively inhibits tumor growth in an orthotopic murine breast cancer model and elicits an immune response, preventing tumor metastasis. The reliable protocol provided by the free&#8208;field ultrasound system facilitates the activation of phytochlorin&#8208;based sonosensitizers while simultaneously stimulating the immune system, highlighting the potential of immune&#8208;sonodynamic therapy.

Largely&#8208;twisted van der Waals (vdW) homojunction of two thin Fe3GeTe2 flakes exhibits pseudotunnel&#8208;magnet resistance behaviors even without intentional introduction of tunnel barrier layers, due to lattice&#8208;mismatch driven vdW gaps.








Abstract
Twistronics, a novel engineering approach involving the alignment of van der Waals (vdW) integrated two&#8208;dimensional materials at specific angles, has recently attracted significant attention. Novel nontrivial phenomena have been demonstrated in twisted vdW junctions (the so&#8208;called magic angle), such as unconventional superconductivity, topological phases, and magnetism. However, there have been only few reports on integrated vdW layers with large twist angles &#952;t, such as twisted interfacial Josephson junctions using high&#8208;temperature superconductors. Herein, vdW homojunctions of the thin&#8208;magnetic flakes, Fe3GeTe2 (FGT), with large &#952;t ranging from 0&#176; to 90&#176;, without inserting any tunnel barriers are assembled. Nevertheless, these vdW homojunctions exhibit tunnel&#8208;magnetoresistance (TMR) like behavior (pseudo&#8208;TMR (PTMR) effect) with the ratios highly sensitive to the &#952;t values, revealing that the vdW gap at the junction interface between the twisted FGT layers behaves like a tunnel barrier and the &#952;t serves a control parameter for PTMR by drastically varying magnitudes of the lattice&#8208;mismatch and the subsequent appearance of antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin alignment. First&#8208;principles calculations considering vacuum gaps indicate strong dependence of TMR on the &#952;t driven by the sixfold screw rotational symmetry of bulk FGT. The present homojunctions hold promise as a platform for novel AFM spin&#8208;dependent phenomena and spintronic applications.

         <title>Additives&#8208;Modified Electrodeposition for Synthesis of Hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O with Ag Single Atoms to Drive CO2 Electroreduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ag single atoms deposited hydrophobic Cu/Cu2O heterostructure (AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O) is designed and synthesized via modified one&#8208;step electrodeposition. In situ Raman spectra and DFT calculations reveal that Ag single atoms delay the reduction of Cu2O and promote the electron transfer. AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O helps promoting *CO to *COH, exhibiting a FEC2+ of 86.1% and 90.2% for CO2 electroreduction in H&#8208;type cell and flow cell, respectively.








Abstract
Copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts are recognized as crucial catalysts for CO2 electroreduction into multi&#8208;carbon products. However, achieving copper&#8208;based electrocatalysts with adjustable valences via one&#8208;step facile synthesis remains a challenge. In this study, Cu/Cu2O heterostructure is constructed by adjusting the anion species of the Cu ions&#8208;containing electrolyte during electrodeposition synthesis. Then, Cu/Cu2O with tuned nanoarchitectures ranging from dendrites to polyhedrons is achieved by introducing transition metal ions as additives, leading to an adjustable interfacial microenvironment for CO2/H2O adsorption on the Cu/Cu2O electrodes. Additionally, the polyhedral Cu/Cu2O catalysts are used as templates for depositing Ag single atoms (AgSA), which are known as synergistic active sites for promoting *CO to *COH toward C2+ products. The prepared AgSA&#8208;Cu/Cu2O catalyst is evaluated in a flow cell and exhibited a FEC2+ of 90.2% and a partial current density (jc2+) of 426.6&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 for CO2 electroreduction. As revealed by in situ Raman spectra and density functional theory calculations, the introduction of Ag single atoms slows down the reduction of Cu+ during CO2 electroreduction, especially at a high current density. This work provides a promising paradigm for diverse control of the compositions and hydrophobicity of Cu&#8208;based catalysts for selective CO2 electroreduction to C2+ products.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Intrinsically Thermoplastic Semiconducting Polymer with Excellent Strain&#8208;Tolerance Capacity for Flexible Ultra&#8208;Deep&#8208;Blue Polymer Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes</title>

High&#8208;efficiency intrinsically thermoplastic semiconducting polymer is demonstrated via internal plasticization. The thermoplastic films not only exhibit outstanding ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with an extremely high efficiency of &#8776;90% and CIE of (0.16, 0.04), but also show an outstanding energy dissipation capacity under the stress effect. Flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) present excellent deformation stability with stable, efficient, and uniform ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescent property.








Abstract
Complex internal stresses that appear in flexible thin&#8208;film electronic devices under long&#8208;term deformation operation are associated with incompatible mechanical properties of the multiple layers, which potentially cause intralayer fracture and separation. These defects may result in device instability, performance loss, and failure. Herein, a thermoplastic functional strategy is proposed for manufacturing high&#8208;performance stretchable semiconducting polymers with excellent strain&#8208;tolerance capacities for flexible electronic devices. Internal plasticization is used to obtain a thermoplastic light&#8208;emitting polymer (N2) that can suppress intralayer tensile fracture and compressive separation to enhance the deformation stability of flexible thin&#8208;film optoelectronic devices, enabling outstanding energy dissipation capacity under stress. The thermoplastic films exhibit stable and efficient ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue emission with a high efficiency of &#8776;90% and chromaticity coordinates of (0.16, 0.04). Moreover, the N2&#8208;based rigid and flexible polymer light&#8208;emitting diodes (PLEDs) exhibit stable ultra&#8208;deep&#8208;blue electroluminescence properties with high EQEs of &#8776;2.4% and 1.9%, respectively. Compared with devices based on brittle PODPF, flexible PLEDs based on thermoplastic films effectively suppress performance degradation after hundreds of cycles of bending fatigue, even under extremely rigid conditions. Introducing intrinsically thermoplastic semiconducting polymers in flexible electronic devices can thus substantially enhance their operational stability under deformation.

         <dc:description>
Self&#8208;adaptive dielectrics (SADs) are future materials for advanced electronic device insulation due to their rapid charge dissipation in distorted electric fields. Current SADs barely achieve tunable nonlinear electrical properties due to the inherent nature of semiconductor filler interfaces. Virus&#8208;like structures are proposed with subminiature metal particles and semiconductor microspheres to overcome this problem, thereby enhancing the rapid charge dissipation capability and flexibility of SADs.








Abstract
Self&#8208;adaptive dielectrics (SADs), with the characteristics of rapid charge dissipation in electric field distortion, is regarded as the future material for package insulation of advanced electronic devices. The current landscape of SADs is incapable to achieve tunable nonlinear electrical conductivity and threshold field strength due to the inherent Schottky barrier, significantly limiting the application scenarios of SADs. Here, a strategy is reported to construct a stepped Schottky barrier through virus&#8208;like structures, which are composed of subminiature metal particles and semiconductor microspheres. It is found that the metal particles can serve as the capture center to attract the free charge in the matrix, precisely instructing the charge transfer pathway. The barriers between metal particles and semiconductor filler, flexibly controlled by the composition of metal particles, endow with extra source of nonlinear conductivity. Under the optimal composition and size of metal particles, SADs exhibit prominent nonlinear electrical conductivity and reliable adaptive charge release characteristics under pulsed electric field. The work pioneers a breakthrough by overcoming the constraint that SADs are previously limited to the inherent Schottky barrier of semiconductor materials and enabling the unprecedented controllability and flexibility of nonlinear electrical characteristics by metal particles, contributing a distinctive perspective to the development of SADs.

         <title>Efficient Photocatalytic Propane Direct Dehydrogenation to Propylene Over PtO2 Clusters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An LD&#8208;Ptn photocatalyst comprising PtO2 clusters and ZnO is synthesized using ZnAl&#8208;LDH as precursor. Owing to small size of PtO2 clusters (&#8776;1.30&#160;nm), LD&#8208;Ptn is rich in PtO2/ZnO interfaces and delivers outstanding photocatalytic activity for propane direct dehydrogenation under UV irradiation. Pt at PtO2/ZnO interfaces act as sites for photogenerated hole concentration, thus activating propane C&#9472;H bonds for propylene synthesis.









Abstract
The direct dehydrogenation of alkanes to olefins under mild conditions is challenging due to the inert nature of alkyl C&#9472;H bonds. Herein, an efficient photocatalytic system is developed for propane direct dehydrogenation (PDH) to propylene, consisting of &#8776;1.30&#160;nm sized PtO2 clusters immobilized on a layered double hydroxide &#8208;derived ZnO/Al2O3 support (LD&#8208;Ptn). Under UV excitation (365&#160;nm), photogenerated holes in ZnO migrate to Pt sites at PtO2/ZnO interfaces, thereby activating and dissociating C&#9472;H bonds in propane. A propylene production rate of almost 1&#160;mmol g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1 and a nearly 100% selectivity are achieved for the compositionally optimized LD&#8208;Ptn photocatalyst. Control experiments and density functional theory calculations further verify that the excellent photocatalytic PDH performance of LD&#8208;Ptn stems from synergism between ZnO semiconductor and the loaded Pt species. This work identifies a promising new route for direct production of olefins from alkanes.

         <title>Resonantly Enhanced Hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel Excitons in Organic&#8211;Inorganic Van Der Waals Heterostructures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The excitonic scenario depends sensitively on the interfacial molecular orientation at an organic&#8211;inorganic CuPc/MoSe2 heterostructure interface. At face&#8208;on orientation, due to interfacial hybridization, a new type of hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel exciton is observed, which exhibits large oscillator strength and the signatures of Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons simultaneously, providing a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics, ultrasensitive molecular detection, and optoelectrical applications.








Abstract
Hybrid excitons formed via resonant hybridization in 2D material heterostructures feature both large optical and electrical dipoles, providing a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics and correlated electronic states. However, hybrid excitons at organic&#8211;inorganic interface combining the advantages of both Wannier&#8211;Mott and Frenkel excitons remain elusive. Here, hybrid excitons are reported in the copper phthalocyanine/molybdenum diselenide (CuPc/MoSe2) heterostructure (HS) featuring strong molecular orientation dependence by low&#8208;temperature photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy. The hybrid Wannier&#8211;Mott&#8211;Frenkel excitons exhibit a large oscillator strength and display signatures of the Frenkel excitons in CuPc and the Wannier&#8211;Mott excitons in MoSe2 simultaneously through the delocalized electrons. The density functional theory (DFT) calculations further confirm the strong hybridization between the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of CuPc and the conduction band minimum (CBM) of MoSe2. The out&#8208;of&#8208;plane molecular orientation is further employed to tune the hybridization strength and tailor the hybrid exciton states. The results reveal the hybrid excitons at the CuPc/MoSe2 interface with tunability by molecular orientation, suggesting that the organic&#8211;inorganic HS constitutes a promising platform for many&#8208;body exciton physics such as exciton condensation and optoelectrical applications.

         <title>Novel Magnetic&#8208;Field&#8208;Free Switching Behavior in vdW&#8208;Magnet/Oxide Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, current&#8208;driven magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching is realized in an unprecedented combination of a van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals/oxide heterostructure, with novel underlying mechanisms of precession&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization and consequent unconventional spin&#8208;orbit torque. It demonstrates a novel approach to utilize both the interface and large Rashba spin&#8208;orbit coupling and opens a new realm by combining burgeoning van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnets and superior oxide spintronics.








Abstract
Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current&#8208;induced out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy&#8208;metal systems, where the current&#8208;induced spin polarization aligns in&#8208;plane orthogonal to the in&#8208;plane charge current and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin current. Here, a new approach is demonstrated for magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching by fabricating a van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;free switching is possible because the current&#8208;driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in&#8208;plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. Van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnet and oxide are successfully combined for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin&#8208;orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows this study to establish a new way of magnetic field&#8208;free switching. This work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van&#8208;der&#8208;Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.

         <title>Water Spillover to Expedite Two&#8208;Electron Oxygen Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water spillover&#8208;type catalyst is synthesized by bridging copper&#8208;based metal&#8208;organic framework nanosheets with pentafluorothiophenol linker, which can circumvent the intrinsic activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off relationship in two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction, expediting the reaction rates from 0.1 to 2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 with both high Faradaic efficiencies and H2O2 yield rates.








Abstract
Limited by the activity&#8208;selectivity trade&#8208;off relationship, the electrochemical activation of small molecules (like O2, N2, and CO2) rapidly diminishes Faradaic efficiencies with elevated current densities (particularly at ampere levels). Nevertheless, some catalysts can circumvent this restriction in a two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR), a sustainable pathway for activating O2 to hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Here we report 2e&#8722; ORR expedited in a fluorine&#8208;bridged copper metal&#8211;organic framework catalyst, arising from the water spillover effect. Through operando spectroscopies, kinetic and theoretical characterizations, it demonstrates that under neutral conditions, water spillover plays a dual role in accelerating water dissociation and stabilizing the key *OOH intermediate. Benefiting from water spillover, the catalyst can expedite 2e&#8722; ORR in the current density range of 0.1&#8211;2.0&#160;A&#160;cm&#8722;2 with both high Faradaic efficiencies (99&#8211;84.9%) and H2O2 yield rates (63.17&#8211;1082.26&#160;mg&#160;h&#8722;1&#160;cm&#8722;2). Further, the feasibility of the present system has been demonstrated by scaling up to a unit module cell of 25&#160;cm2, in combination with techno&#8208;economics simulations showing H2O2 production cost strongly dependent on current densities, giving the lowest H2O2 price of $0.50&#160;kg&#8722;1 at 2.0 A cm&#8722;2. This work is expected to provide an additional dimension to leverage systems independent oftraditional rules.

An elastocaloric thermal battery based on distinctive phase&#8208;change alloys is developed, which stably stores low&#8208;temperature waste heat as latent heat and releases it on demand through applied stress at ambient temperature. These alloys, with desired transformation characteristics, are efficiently discovered using a generative learning&#8208;enabled inverse design framework, which converts the hand&#8208;drawn target heat flow curve into tangible compositional and processing designs.









Abstract
An elastocaloric thermal battery based on generative learning&#8208;designed phase&#8208;change alloys is developed to facilitate the efficient recycling of low&#8208;temperature waste heat. This battery stores thermal energy as latent heat in a phase&#8208;change alloy and releases it on demand through applied stress at ambient temperature. Alloy compositions and corresponding processing parameters, tailored to desired transformation characteristics, are efficiently discovered through a generative learning&#8208;enabled inverse design framework, which converts the hand&#8208;drawn target heat flow curve into tangible compositional and processing designs.

         <title>Perovskite&#8208;Based Smart Eyeglasses as Noncontact Human&#8211;Computer Interaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Smart eyeglasses based on perovskite photodetectors are developed, capable of directly converting visual stimuli from the reflected light of the eyeballs into electrical signals. After scaling up the pretraining data and model size, these eyeglasses achieve noncontact monitoring of eyeball movement with a 5&#176; recognition angle, enabling unobtrusive control of a model car to execute 9 commands with 99.86% accuracy.








Abstract
More than 70% of human information comes from vision. The eye is one of the most attractive sensing sites to collect biological parameters. However, it is urgent to develop a cost&#8208;effective and easy&#8208;to&#8208;use approach to monitor eyeball information in a minimally invasive way instead of current smart contact lenses or camera&#8208;based eyeglasses. Here, the biomimetic mineralization strategy is developed to prepare large&#8208;grained perovskite film on the glass with prepared ITO electrodes, which displays the on&#8211;off ratio close to 300 times at 500 Lux light intensity, and the responsiveness reaches 22.09 A&#160;W&#8722;1. The smart eyeglasses composed of perovskite&#8208;based photodetectors can directly convert the visual stimuli from the reflective light of eyeballs into electrical signals in all light circumstances. After scaling up the pretraining data and the model size, the smart eyeglasses achieve the noncontact monitoring of the eyeball movement with the recognition angle of 5&#176;, which can be used to unobtrusively drive the model car with great freedom. The smart eyeglasses based on the perovskite photodetectors provide cost&#8208;effective approaches for monitoring eyeball movements, which will show great potential in the applications of man&#8208;machine control, augmented reality, individual healthcare, etc.

         <title>Beyond Inducing Anionic Redox: Controllable Migration Sequence of Li Ions in Transition Metal Layers Toward Highly Stable Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The extra role of Li ions in transition metal layers (LiTM) beyond inducing oxygen redox is revealed in the Li&#8208;rich oxide Li2Ru0.75Zr0.25O3. The preferential migration of LiTM, which can be achieved by proper cation regulation, plays an imperative role in preventing the structural transformation by postponing the slab gliding of the layered structure.








Abstract
The energy density of layered oxides of Li&#8208;ion batteries can be enhanced by inducing oxygen redox through replacing transition metal (TM) ions with Li ions in the TM layer. Undesirably, the cathodes always suffer from unfavorable structural degradation, which is closely associated with irreversible TM migration and slab gliding, resulting in continuous capacity and voltage decay. Herein, attention is paid to the Li ions in the TM layer (LiTM) and find their extra effects beyond inducing oxygen redox, which has been rarely mentioned. With the aid of 7Li solid&#8208;state NMR and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the controllable migration of LiTM is verified. The mystery is uncovered that the preferential migration of LiTM plays an imperative role in preventing the structural transformation by postponing the slab gliding of the layered structure. Integrated with the inhibited TM migration, the structural robustness and reversibility of Li2RuO3 can be drastically improved after Zr&#8208;substitution, providing a solid foundation for achieving ultra&#8208;stable electrochemical performance even after thousands of cycles (2500 cycles). The discovery highlights the significance of LiTM with respect to the structural robustness and provides a potential route toward high&#8208;energy&#8208;density Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Metalloparticle&#8208;Engineered Pickering Emulsion Displaying AAV&#8208;Vectored Vaccine for Enhancing Antigen Expression and Immunogenicity Against Pathogens</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>

Pickering emulsion is stabilized by biomineralized manganese nanoparticles and aluminum hydroxide, enabling rapid and efficient loading of AAVs, diversifying AAV endocytic pathways, and further activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway for higher AAV target gene expression and stronger cellular immune responses.









Abstract
Recombinant adeno&#8208;associated viruses (rAAVs) have emerged as promising vaccine vectors due to their enduring efficacy with a single dose. However, insufficient cellular immune responses and the random and non&#8208;specific distribution of AAVs post&#8208;injection may hinder the development of AAV vaccines. Here, a novel Pickering emulsion platform stabilized by biomineralized manganese nanoparticles and aluminum hydroxide, which can rapidly and efficiently load AAVs, is reported. This platform confers AAVs with favorable in vivo distribution kinetics, diversifying AAV endocytic pathways with reduced dependency on the sialic acid receptor&#8208;mediated route, and ultimately enhancing AAV infection efficiency in antigen present cells (APCs). Concurrently, the Pickering emulsion substantially boosts endogenous 2&#8242;3&#8242;&#8208;cGAMP production, further activating the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway for stronger immune responses and improving protective efficacy in bacterial infection models. The STING pathway activation also increases AAV target gene expression, potently augmenting the cross&#8208;protective potential of AAV vaccines for COVID&#8208;19. These synergistic effects ensure that effective immune responses are induced even at one&#8208;fifth of the AAV vaccination dose, while the Pickering emulsion further reduces the accumulation of AAV in the liver, thereby improving their safety. The findings highlight the potential of Pickering emulsions as valuable enhancers for viral vectors, providing insights for their broader clinical applicability.

A Mo1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy is developed to enable atom&#8208;scale cascade catalysis via multi&#8208;active site collaboration for CO2 Electroreduction. The as&#8208;prepared Mo1Cu shows a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 86.4% under 0.80 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the C2+ partial current density over Mo1Cu reaches an ampere&#8208;level 1.33&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency surpasses 74.3%.









Abstract
Electrochemical reduction of CO2 to value&#8208;added multicarbon (C2+) productions offers an attractive route for renewable energy storage and CO2 utilization, but it remains challenging to achieve high C2+ selectivity at industrial&#8208;level current density. Herein, a Mo1Cu single&#8208;atom alloy (SAA) catalyst is reported that displays a remarkable C2+ Faradaic efficiency of 86.4% under 0.80 A cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, the C2+ partial current density over Mo1Cu reaches 1.33&#8201;A&#8201;cm&#8722;2 with a Faradaic efficiency surpasses 74.3%. The combination of operando spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) indicates the as&#8208;prepared Mo1Cu SAA catalyst enables atom&#8208;scale cascade catalysis via multi&#8208;active site collaboration. The introduced Mo sites promote the H2O dissociation to fabricate active *H, meanwhile, the Cu sites (Cu0) far from Mo atom are active sites for the CO2 activation toward CO. Further, CO and *H are captured by the adjacent Cu sites (Cu&amp;+) near Mo atom, accelerating CO conversion and C&#9472;C coupling process. Our findings benefit the design of tandem electrocatalysts at atomic scale for transforming CO2 to multicarbon products under a high conversion rate.

         <title>Buried Interface Modulation Using Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayer and Ionic Liquid Hybrids for High&#8208;Performance Perovskite and Perovskite/CuInGaSe2 Tandem Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An interface modulation approach that utilizes ionic liquid to enhance the uniformity of self&#8208;assembled monolayer distribution and to regulate the high&#8208;quality growth of perovskites is pioneered. This method has demonstrated impressive efficiencies of 25.68% and 22.53% for normal&#8208;bandgap (NBG) and wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs), respectively. Furthermore, four&#8208;terminal (4T) perovskite/CIGS solar cells with an efficiency of 28.34% are achieved.








Abstract
Effective modifications for the buried interface between self&#8208;assembled monolayers (SAMs) and perovskites are vital for the development of efficient, stable inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) and their tandem photovoltaics. Herein, an ionic&#8208;liquid&#8208;SAM hybrid strategy is developed to synergistically optimize the uniformity of SAMs and the crystallization of perovskites above. Specifically, an ionic liquid of 1&#8208;butyl&#8208;3&#8208;methyl&#8208;1H&#8208;imidazol&#8208;3&#8208;iumbis((trifluoromethyl)sulfonyl)amide (BMIMTFSI) is incorporated into the SAM solution, enabling reduced surface roughness, improved wettability, and a more evenly distributed surface potential of the SAM film. Leveraging this optimized substrate, a favorable growth of high&#8208;quality perovskite crystals is achieved. Furthermore, the introduced functional ions readily bond with the perovskites, effectively passivating undesirable cation or halide vacancies of the perovskite near the buried interface. Remarkably, high power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of 25.68% and 22.53% are obtained for normal&#8208;bandgap (&#8776;1.55&#160;eV) and wide&#8208;bandgap (WBG) (&#8776;1.66&#160;eV) PSCs along with improved operational stability. Additionally, a champion PCE of 19.50% is achieved for semitransparent WBG PSCs, further delivering an impressive PCE of 28.34% for integrated four&#8208;terminal tandem photovoltaics when combined with CuInGaSe2 solar cells.

         <title>Longitudinal and Noninvasive Intracellular Recordings of Spontaneous Electrophysiological Activity in Rat Primary Neurons on Planar MEA Electrodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An approach is presented to noninvasively porate neurons on planar MEA electrodes and enable the recording of intracellular&#8208;like action potentials without interfering with the spontaneous activity of the network not affecting the neuronal health. In particular, it is shown that the method works on commercial MEA electrodes integrated on both high density and high&#8208;throughput MEAs.








Abstract
Presently, the in vitro recording of intracellular neuronal signals on microelectrode arrays (MEAs) requires complex 3D nanostructures or invasive and approaches such as electroporation. Here, it is shown that laser poration enables intracellular coupling on planar electrodes without damaging neurons or altering their spontaneous electrophysiological activity, allowing the process to be repeated multiple times on the same cells. This capability distinguishes laser&#8208;based neuron poration from more invasive methods like electroporation, which typically serve as endpoint measurement for cells. It is demonstrated that planar MEA electrodes, when combined with laser cell optoporation and live cell staining, can record spontaneous intracellular signaling from primary neurons in vitro. This approach allows for the detection of attenuated signals resembling positive monophasic intracellular action potentials. Recordings after laser optoporation also reveal subthreshold signals such as post&#8208;synaptic potentials that are essential for assessing neuronal network plasticity and connectivity. Moreover, the noninvasiveness of the process enables repeated intracellular recordings over multiple days from the same cells.

         <title>Transformation&#8208;Invariant Laplacian Metadevices Robust to Environmental Variation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the recently proposed transformation&#8208;invariant metamaterial, a DC cloak made of judiciously stacked copper/air multilayer is successfully constructed. It shows a robust cloaking performance even if the background conductivity varies from 22 to 859 kS&#160;m&#8722;1, which demonstrates significantly improved environment&#8208;immune properties compared with those of conventional cloaks, for example traditional TO cloak and bi&#8208;layer cloak.








Abstract
As one of the typical applications of metamaterials, the invisibility cloak has raised vast research interests. After many years&#8217; research efforts, the invisibility cloak has extended its applicability from optics and acoustics to electrostatics and thermal diffusion. One scientific challenge that has significantly restricted the practical application of the invisibility cloak is the strong background dependence, that is, all passive cloaking devices realized thus far are unable to resist variation in the background refractive index. To tackle such a challenge, the concept of transformation&#8208;invariant metamaterials (TIMs) is applied to static&#8208;field systems and shows that, for any physical fields governed by Laplace equation, judiciously designed TIMs can be used to realize invisibility cloaks robust to the environment variation. As an experimental proof, an ideal direct current (DC) cloak&#8208;is implemented based on TIMs and near&#8208;field measurement results demonstrate that such a cloak can successfully conceal a large&#8208;scale object when the background conductivity varies from 22 to 859 kS&#160;m&#8722;1. Moreover, the background&#8208;immune cloaking effect is observed under arbitrary electric sources. The approach proposed in this work can be also applied to static magnetics, thermal diffusion, and beyond, enabling robust isolation of the target from the external field in versatile application scenarios.

         <title>Enhancing Photovoltaically Preferred Orientation in Wide&#8208;Bandgap Perovskite for Efficient All&#8208;Perovskite Tandem Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nicotinamide derivatives with multi&#8208;functional groups modulate crystal growth and mitigate defects in wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite, favoring the photovoltaically preferred (100) facet and energy band alignment, enabling efficient and stable single&#8208;junction wide&#8208;bandgap and all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells with efficiencies of 19.34% and 28.57%, respectively.








Abstract
Wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells (WBG PSCs) have promising applications in tandem devices yet suffer from low open&#8208;circuit voltages (VOCs) and less stability. To address these issues, the study introduces multifunctional nicotinamide derivatives into WBG PSCs, leveraging the regulation on photovoltaically preferential orientation and optoelectronic properties via diverse functional groups, e.g., carbonyl, amino. Isonicotinamide (IA) molecule emerges as the most effective agent, enhancing crystallization kinetics and defect passivation due to its unique planar spatial configuration. Incorporating IA into WBG perovskites improves the (100) preferred crystal orientation, reduces trap density, and enables well&#8208;matched energy band alignment. High&#8208;performance 1.77&#160;eV WBG PSCs are achieved with a champion power conversion efficiency of 19.34% and a VOC of 1.342&#160;V, leading to the fabrication of the best&#8208;performing all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cell with a PCE of 28.53% (certified 28.27%) and excellent operational stability, maintaining over 90% of the initial efficiency under 1 sun illumination for 600 h.

         <title>Extending Exciton Diffusion Length via an Organic&#8208;Metal Platinum Complex Additive for High&#8208;Performance Thick&#8208;Film Organic Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic&#8208;metal platinum complex (TTz&#8208;Pt) is synthesized and employed as a solid additive. Benefiting from the prolonged exciton diffusion length (LD) in the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated device, a champion PCE of 20.12% (certified as 19.54%) is obtained for 100 nm&#8208;thick D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC OSCs. Impressively, the 300 nm&#8208;thick D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC OSCs achieve an outstanding PCE of 18.84%, the record value for 300 nm&#8208;thick OSCs.








Abstract
The long exciton diffusion length (LD) plays an important role in promoting exciton dissociation, suppressing charge recombination, and improving the charge transport process, thereby improving the performance of organic solar cells (OSCs), especially in thick&#8208;film OSCs. However, the limited LD hinders further improvement in device performance as the film thickness increases. Here, an organic&#8208;metal platinum complex, namely TTz&#8208;Pt, is synthesized and served as a solid additive into the D18&#8208;Cl:L8&#8208;BO system. The addition of TTz&#8208;Pt enhanced the crystallinity of blends, reduced energy disorder, and trap density, and decreased non&#8208;radiative recombination and exciton binding energy, which is conducive to prolonging the LD in the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated film, thereby facilitating the exciton dissociation and charge transport process along with inhibiting the charge recombination. Consequently, the TTz&#8208;Pt&#8208;treated D18:L8&#8208;BO:IDIC device (100&#160;nm) exhibits a champion power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 20.12% (certified as 19.54%), one of the highest PCEs reported for OSCs to date. Remarkably, a record&#8208;breaking PCE of 18.84% is yielded for the active layer thickness of 300&#160;nm. Furthermore, the TTz&#8208;Pt exhibits superior universality in improving the performance of OSCs. This work provides a simple and universal approach to extending LD by introducing an organic&#8208;metal platinum complex as a solid additive to achieve highly efficient thick&#8208;film OSCs.

         <title>An OMV&#8208;Based Nanovaccine as Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer for Cancer Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This article introduces the &#8220;Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer&#8221; (APSE), a novel tumor vaccine platform using bacterial outer membrane vesicles loaded with tumor antigens and modified with &#945;PD&#8208;L1 antibodies. By activating and boosting co&#8208;stimulatory signals in antigen&#8208;presenting cells, APSE overcomes low antigen presentation efficiency caused by high PD&#8208;L1 expression, offering the potential to improve cancer vaccine efficacy, especially for less immunogenic tumors.









Abstract
Antigen&#8208;presenting cells (APCs) process tumor vaccines and present tumor antigens as the first signals to T cells to activate anti&#8208;tumor immunity, which process requires the assistance of co&#8208;stimulatory second signals on APCs. The immune checkpoint programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) not only mediates the immune escape of tumor cells but also acts as a co&#8208;inhibitory second signal on APCs. The serious dysfunction of second signals due to the high expression of PD&#8208;L1 on APCs in the tumor body results in the inefficiency of tumor vaccines. To overcome this challenge, a previously established Plug&#8208;and&#8208;Display tumor vaccine platform based on bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) is developed into an &#8220;Antigen Presentation Signal Enhancer&#8221; (APSE) by surface&#8208;modifying PD&#8208;L1 antibodies (&#945;PD&#8208;L1). While delivering tumor antigens, APSE can activate the expression of co&#8208;stimulatory second signals in APCs due to the high immunogenicity of OMVs. More importantly, the surface&#8208;modified &#945;PD&#8208;L1 binds to the co&#8208;inhibitory signals PD&#8208;L1, potentially restoring CD80 function and ensuring efficient co&#8208;stimulatory second signals and activation of anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The results reveal the importance of PD&#8208;L1 blockage in the initiation process of anti&#8208;tumor immunity, and the second signal modulation capability of APSE can expand the application potential of cancer vaccines to less immunogenic malignancies.

         <title>Light&#8208;Induced Hysteresis of Electronic Polarization in Anti&#8208;Ferromagnet FePS3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hysteresis of electronic polarization in the anti&#8208;ferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 is demonstrated via light, resulting in the optical multiferroic phase. The hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs due to the octupolar polarization within the spin lattice, which suggests a new mechanism for controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light.








Abstract
Research on manipulating materials using light has garnered significant interest, yet examples of controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials remain scarce. Here, the hysteresis of electronic polarization in the anti&#8208;ferromagnetic semiconductor FePS3 is demonstrated via light. Below the N&#233;el temperature, linear dichroism (i.e., optical anisotropy) without structural symmetry breaking is observed. Light&#8208;induced net polarization aligns along the a&#8208;axis (zigzag direction) at 1.6&#160;eV due to the dipolar polarization and along the b&#8208;axis (armchair direction) at 2.0&#160;eV due to the combined effects of dipolar and octupolar polarizations, resulting from charge transfer from the armchair to the zigzag direction by light. Unexpected hysteresis of the electronic polarization occurs at 2.0&#160;eV due to the octupolar polarization, in contrast to the absence of such hysteresis at 1.6&#160;eV. This is attributed to a symmetry breaking of the light&#8208;induced phase of FePS3 involving electronic polarization within the spin lattice. Here a new mechanism is suggested for generating and controlling electronic polarization in magnetic materials using light, with implications for future device applications.

         <title>Design of Fluorinated Peptides as Biotransformed Urinalysis Biomarkers for Non&#8208;Invasive Diagnosis and Treatment of Liver Injury through Enzyme Directed Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fluorinated peptides are designed as synthetic biomarkers for the time&#8208;gated 19F nuclear magnetic resonance urinalysis through enzyme&#8208;activated assembly, which regulates the metabolic kinetics of fluorinated peptides. Moreover, the fluorinated peptides are further conjugated with therapeutic agents and demonstrated great efficiency in the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.








Abstract
Urinalysis, as a non&#8208;invasive and efficient diagnostic method, is very important but faces great challenges due to the complex compositions of urine and limited naturally occurring biomarkers for diseases. Herein, by leveraging the intrinsic absence of endogenous fluorinated interference, a strategy with the enzymatically activated assembly of synthetic fluorinated peptide for cholestatic liver injury (CLI) diagnosis and treatment through 19F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) urinalysis and efficient drug retention is developed.

&lt;p&gt;Fluorinated peptides are designed as synthetic biomarkers for the time-gated &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F nuclear magnetic resonance urinalysis through enzyme-activated assembly, which regulates the metabolic kinetics of fluorinated peptides. Moreover, the fluorinated peptides are further conjugated with therapeutic agents and demonstrated great efficiency in the treatment of cholestatic liver injury.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Urinalysis, as a non-invasive and efficient diagnostic method, is very important but faces great challenges due to the complex compositions of urine and limited naturally occurring biomarkers for diseases. Herein, by leveraging the intrinsic absence of endogenous fluorinated interference, a strategy with the enzymatically activated assembly of synthetic fluorinated peptide for cholestatic liver injury (CLI) diagnosis and treatment through &lt;sup&gt;19&lt;/sup&gt;F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) urinalysis and efficient drug retention is developed. Specifically, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), overexpressed in the liver of CLI mice, triggers the assembly of fluorinated peptide, thus, directing&#160;the traffic and dynamic distribution of the synthetic biomarkers after administration, whereas CLI mice display much slower clearance of peptides through urine as compared with healthy counterparts. As such, it enables to transform pathophysiological information into exogenous signals via noninvasive urinary monitoring. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept, by grafting different functional groups to peptides, the theranostic platforms can be established to provide&#160;a new paradigm for the design of multifunctional peptides.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Room&#8208;Temperature Magnetic Antiskyrmions in Canted Ferrimagnetic CoHo Alloy Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Room&#8208;temperature antiskyrmions are observed in CoHo alloy films with various thicknesses using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. Rotating magnetic fields (H) are used to enhance their areal density by an order of magnitude compared to that under individual vertical H. The accurately balancing between dipolar interactions and magnetic anisotropy is experimentally and theoretically confirmed to facilitate antiskyrmion nucleation.








Abstract
Magnetic antiskyrmions, the anti&#8208;quasiparticles of magnetic skyrmions, possess alternating Bloch&#8208; and N&#233;el&#8208;type spin spirals, rendering them promising for advanced spintronics&#8208;based information storage. To date, antiskyrmions are demonstrated in a few bulk materials featuring anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii&#8211;Moriya interactions and a limited number of artificial multilayers. Identifying novel film materials capable of hosting isolated antiskyrmions is critical for memory applications in topological spintronics. Herein, the formation of room&#8208;temperature antiskyrmions in single ferrimagnetic CoHo rare&#8208;metal alloy films of varying thicknesses, observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy is reported. Furthermore, rotating magnetic fields (H) are proposed to facilitate antiskyrmion nucleation and enhance their areal density by an order of magnitude compared to that in the same area under individual vertical H. In addition, experimental and phenomenological analysis confirm that antiskyrmion nucleation can be attributed to spin reorientation involving spontaneous canted magnetism, as evidenced by polarized neutron reflectometry. Micromagnetic simulations further show that the antiskyrmion density significantly depends on the magnitude of the rotating field. These findings expand the family of known antiskyrmion&#8208;hosting materials and provide insights into their formation mechanisms, thus serving as a basis for their application in topological spintronics.

         <title>Permeable and Durable Liquid&#8208;Metal Fiber Mat as Implantable Physiological Electrodes with Long&#8208;Term Biocompatibility</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The LM implantable physiological electrode (LM&#8208;Ag&#8208;pSBS) is designed based on a spatial wettability tuning strategy. The wettability issue of LMs within the three&#8208;dimensional porous skeletons of the substrate is addressed by the synergistic interaction between Ag and LMs. Due to its long&#8208;term biocompatibility and durability, the LM&#8208;Ag&#8208;pSBS shows great potential in smart healthcare, brain&#8208;computer interface, and disability rehabilitation.








Abstract
Implantable physiological electrodes provide unprecedented opportunities for real&#8208;time and uninterrupted monitoring of biological signals. Most implantable electronics adopt thin&#8208;film substrates with low permeability that severely hampers tissue metabolism, impeding their long&#8208;term biocompatibility. Recent innovations have seen the advent of permeable electronics through the strategic modification of liquid metals (LMs) onto porous substrates. However, the durability of these electronics is limited by the inherent poor wettability of LMs, particularly within the intricate 3D skeleton of the porous substrate. Herein, the study reports a spatial wettability tuning strategy that solves the wettability issue of LMs within the porous substrates, enabling the LM physiological electrodes with high durability and long&#8208;term biocompatibility. The study demonstrates the use of the electrodes as implantable neural interface to realize in vivo acquisition of electrocardiograph and electrocorticogram signals with long&#8208;term biocompatibility and high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio. This work demonstrates a promising direction for rational design of durable implantable bioelectronics with long&#8208;term biocompatibility.

         <title>Formation Dynamics of Thermally Stable 1D/3D Perovskite Interfaces for High&#8208;Performance Photovoltaics</title>

The formation dynamics of low&#8208;dimensional perovskites derived from N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methanamine hydroiodide (M&#8208;NMAI) are studied. The exclusively produced thermally stable 1D structure on 3D perovskite films other than heterogeneous nucleation preferred Ruddlesden&#8211;Popper 2D perovskite structure benefits the resulting n&#8208;i&#8208;p perovskite solar cells to achieve a peak efficiency of 25.51% with significantly enhanced thermal stability.








Abstract
Direct understanding of the formation and crystallization of low&#8208;dimensional (LD) perovskites with varying dimensionalities employing the same bulky cations can offer insights into LD perovskites and their heterostructures with 3D perovskites. In this study, the secondary amine cation of N&#8208;methyl&#8208;1&#8208;(naphthalen&#8208;1&#8208;yl)methylammonium (M&#8208;NMA+) and the formation dynamics of its corresponding LD perovskite are investigated. The intermolecular &#960;&#8211;&#960; stacking of M&#8208;NMA+ and their connection with inorganic PbI6 octahedrons within the product structures control the formation of LD perovskite. In an N,N&#8208;dimethylformamide (DMF) precursor solution, both 1D and 2D products can be obtained. Interestingly, due to the strong interaction between M&#8208;NMA+ and the DMF solvent, compared to the 1D phase, the formation of 2D perovskites is uniquely dependent on heterogeneous nucleation. Nevertheless, post&#8208;treatment of 3D perovskite films with an isopropanol solution of M&#8208;NMAI leads to the exclusive formation of thermally stable 1D phases on the surface. The resulting 1D/3D heterostructure facilitates perovskite solar cells (PSCs) to not only achieve a record efficiency of 25.51% through 1D perovskite passivation but also significantly enhance the thermal stability of unencapsulated devices at 85&#160;&#176;C. This study deepens the understanding of the formation dynamics of LD perovskites and offers an efficient strategy for fabricating stable and high&#8208;performance PSCs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast Moisture Sensor for Respiratory Cycle Monitoring and Non&#8208;Contact Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanogap electrodes are combined with egg albumen to develop a fast and sensitive moisture sensor. This device integrates scalable manufacturing, exceptional sensitivity, rapid response times, and selective moisture detection across a 10&#8211;70% relative humidity range. The sensor is used for non&#8208;contact sensing applications and monitoring respiratory cycles in real&#8208;world settings.








Abstract
As human&#8208;machine interface hardware advances, better sensors are required to detect signals from different stimuli. Among numerous technologies, humidity sensors are critical for applications across different sectors, including environmental monitoring, food production, agriculture, and healthcare. Current humidity sensors rely on materials that absorb moisture, which can take some time to equilibrate with the surrounding environment, thus slowing their temporal response and limiting their applications. Here, this challenge is tackled by combining a nanogap electrode (NGE) architecture with chicked egg&#8208;derived albumen as the moisture&#8208;absorbing component. The sensors offer inexpensive manufacturing, high responsivity, ultra&#8208;fast response, and selectivity to humidity within a relative humidity range of 10&#8211;70% RH. Specifically, the egg albumen&#8208;based sensor showed negligible response to relevant interfering species and remained specific to water moisture with a room&#8208;temperature responsivity of 1.15&#160;&#215;&#160;104. The nm&#8208;short interelectrode distance (circa 20&#160;nm) of the NGE architecture enables fast temporal response, with rise/fall times of 10/28&#160;ms, respectively, making the devices the fastest humidity sensors reported to date based on a biomaterial. By leveraging these features, non&#8208;contact moisture sensing and real&#8208;time respiratory cycle monitoring suitable for diagnosing chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, asthma, and pulmonary disease are demonstrated.

Specifically, the egg albumen-based sensor showed negligible response to relevant interfering species and remained specific to water moisture with a room-temperature responsivity of 1.15&#160;&#215;&#160;10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. The nm-short interelectrode distance (circa 20&#160;nm) of the NGE architecture enables fast temporal response, with rise/fall times of 10/28&#160;ms, respectively, making the devices the fastest humidity sensors reported to date based on a biomaterial. By leveraging these features, non-contact moisture sensing and real-time respiratory cycle monitoring suitable for diagnosing chronic diseases such as sleep apnea, asthma, and pulmonary disease are demonstrated.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Oriented Molecular Dipole&#8208;Enabled Modulation of NiOx/Perovskite Interface for Pb&#8208;Sn Mixed Inorganic Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
High&#8208;performance Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic perovskite solar cells are achieved by introducing a 4&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid dipole interlayer at the NiOx/perovskite interface. The oriented dipole interlayer modulates energy level alignment, inhibits interface redox reactions, and improves perovskite quality. The resulting device achieves a champion efficiency of 17.4%, while also demonstrating excellent UV&#8208;radiation resistance and operational stability.








Abstract
Nickel oxide (NiOx) is considered as a potential hole transport material in the fabrication of lead&#8208;tin (Pb&#8208;Sn) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) for tandem applications. However, the energy level mismatch and unfavorable redox reactions between Ni&#8805;3+ species and Sn2+ at the NiOx/perovskite interface pose challenges. Herein, high&#8208;performance Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs are demonstrated by modulating the NiOx/perovskite interface with a multifunctional 4&#8208;aminobenzenesulfonic acid (4&#8208;ABSA) interlayer. The 4&#8208;ABSA interlayer induces the formation of an oriented dipole moment directed from NiOx to perovskite, effectively elevating the valance band maximum of the NiOx film, thus balancing the energy level difference and promoting charge carrier extraction of the device. Moreover, the 4&#8208;ABSA molecules interact with both NiOx and perovskite, suppressing the reaction of highly active Ni&#8805;3+ species with perovskites while regulating perovskite crystallization. This results in perovskite films with reduced defect density and enlarged grains. Consequently, a remarkable device efficiency of 17.4% is obtained, representing the highest reported value for Pb&#8208;Sn&#8208;based inorganic PSCs thus far. Furthermore, the 4&#8208;ABSA interlayer enhances the UV&#8208;radiation and operational stability of the resulting devices, maintaining over 80% and 90% of the initial efficiency after 240&#160;h of UV&#8208;light exposure and 480&#160;h of 1 sun illumination, respectively.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Cascade Enhancement of T1&#8208;T2 Dual&#8208;Modal MRI in Tumors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an in situ, two&#8208;step self&#8208;assembled system that enhances both T1 and T2 MRI signals through intracellular cascade regulation of contrast agent size, enabling T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;modal MRI for tumor imaging. It explores the relationship between nanostructure size and MRI contrast, providing a new method for developing MRI contrast and multi&#8208;morphological nanomedicines at targeted sites for improved theranostics.








Abstract
Currently, there is no conclusive evidence indicating that in situ self&#8208;assembled Gd nanostructures of varying sizes demonstrate distinct T1 and T2 signal enhancement capabilities. Furthermore, it remains uncertain whether size adjustment can effectively achieve enhanced T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;modal MRI. To address these uncertainties, a two&#8208;step in situ self&#8208;assembly strategy is developed. This approach began with a small&#8208;sized nanoprobe, Gd&#8208;TCO&#8208;P, with a hydrodynamic diameter (dH) of 16 &#177;&#160;3&#160;nm. This nanoprobe underwent alkaline phosphatase (ALP) cleavage and self&#8208;assembled intracellularly into short nanofibers termed Gd&#8208;NFs (dH: 200 &#177;&#160;51&#160;nm). The subsequent introduction of tetrazine&#8208;tetrazine crosslinked these Gd&#8208;NFs, leading to the formation of larger two&#8208;stage dendritic nanofibers known as Gd&#8208;TS&#8208;NFs (dH: 4371 &#177;&#160;236&#160;nm). This process achieves size&#8208;dependent enhancement of both T1 and T2 signals, which is validated through both in vitro and in vivo experiments, enabling precise long&#8208;term imaging of ALP&#8208;overexpressing tumors. This study not only provides valuable insights into the relationship between the size of in situ formed Gd nanostructures and T1/T2 MRI contrast enhancement, but also suggests a promising strategy for clinical applications of T1&#8208;T2 dual&#8208;modal MRI.

         <title>A Phase&#8208;Transition&#8211;Free Sodium Vanadium Phosphate Cathode via Medium&#8208;Entropy Engineering for Superior Sodium Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A medium&#8208;entropy Na3.2V1.1Ti0.2Al0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.1(PO4)3 (ME&#8208;NVP) cathode is developed, featuring a phase&#8208;transition&#8211;free mechanism, reversible V3+/V4+/V5+ plateaus, rapid Na+ diffusion, and minimal volume change, as confirmed by comprehensive in/ex situ characterizations and theoretical calculations. Thus, the medium&#8208;entropy effect favors ME&#8208;NVP cathode an exceptional sodium storage performance with high&#8208;rate capacity and long&#8208;term cycle stability.









Abstract
Na3V2(PO4)3, based on multi&#8208;electron reactions between V3+/V4+/V5+, is a promising cathode material for SIBs. However, its practical application is hampered by the inferior conductivity, large barrier of V4+/V5+, and stepwise phase transition. Herein, these issues are addressed by constructing a medium&#8208;entropy material (Na3.2V1.1Ti0.2Al0.2Cr0.2Mn0.2Ni0.1(PO4)3, ME&#8208;NVP) with strong ME&#9472;O bond and highly occupied Na2 sites. Benefiting from the medium&#8208;entropy effect, ME&#8208;NVP manifests a phase&#8208;transition&#8211;free reaction mechanism, two reversible plateaus at 3.4 (V3+/V4+) and 4.0&#160;V (V4+/V5+), and small volume change (2%) during Na+ insertion/extraction processes, as confirmed by comprehensive in/ex situ characterizations. Moreover, kinetics analysis illuminates the superior Na+ diffusion ability of ME&#8208;NVP. Thus, the ME&#8208;NVP cathode realizes remarkable rate capability of 67&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 50C and a long&#8208;term lifespan over 10&#160;000 cycles (capacity retention of 81.3%). Theoretical calculations further illustrate that the weak binding of Na+ ion in the channel is responsible for the rapid Na+ diffusion, accounting for the superior reaction kinetics. Moreover, rigid MEO6 octahedral and feasible rearrangement of Na+ ions can suppress the phase transition, thus endowing an ultrastable ME&#8208;NVP cathode. This work highlights the significant role of medium&#8208;entropy engineering in advancing the output voltage, cycling stability, and rate capability of polyanionic cathodes.

         <title>Soft Sputtering of Large&#8208;Area 2D MoS2 Layers Using Isolated Plasma Soft Deposition for Humidity Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly crystalline MoS2 films with tunable layer thicknesses are fabricated using an isolated plasma soft deposition system to enhance scalability and layer control. The films demonstrated precise layer&#8208;controlled deposition from mono&#8208; to tetralayers, and the resulting respiration sensors exhibited a rapid response time of 2.14 s at relative humidity levels of 30% to 60%.








Abstract
2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides are emerging as key materials for next&#8208;generation semiconductor technologies owing to their tunable bandgaps, high carrier mobilities, and exceptional surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratios. Among them, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) has garnered significant attention. However, scalable wafer&#8208;level deposition methods that enable uniform layer&#8208;controlled synthesis remain a critical challenge. In this paper, a novel fabrication approach&#8212;isolated plasma soft deposition (IPSD) followed by sulfurization&#8212;for the scalable production of 2D MoS2 with precise layer control is introduced. The IPSD system employs a scanning&#8208;based deposition method combined with plasma surface pretreatment, achieving large&#8208;area, high&#8208;quality 2D MoS2 layers. Comprehensive characterizations using Raman, UV&#8211;vis, and photoluminescence spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the successful synthesis of crystalline mono&#8208; to tetralayer 2D MoS2 on 6&#8208;inch SiO2/Si substrates. Furthermore, respiration sensors fabricated using the IPSD&#8208;grown 2D MoS2 layers demonstrated fast response times (&#8776;1 s) and high response to relative humidity levels between 30% and 60%. This study offers significant advancements in the scalable synthesis of 2D MoS2 and opens new avenues for its application in advanced sensing and electronic devices.

         <title>Manganese Galvanic Cells Intervene in Tumor Metabolism to Reinforce cGAS&#8208;STING Activation for Bidirectional Synergistic Hydrogen&#8208;Immunotherapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Manganese galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2&#8208;immunotherapy. MnG not only potentiates the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway through sustained release of Mn2+ but also regulates tumor glucose metabolism to inhibit the TREX2 expression, thereby providing favorable support for antitumor therapy.








Abstract
The cGAS&#8208;STING pathway is pivotal in initiating antitumor immunity. However, tumor metabolism, particularly glycolysis, negatively regulates the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. Herein, Mn galvanic cells (MnG) are prepared via liquid&#8208;phase exfoliation and in situ galvanic replacement to modulate tumor metabolism, thereby enhancing cGAS&#8208;STING activation for bidirectional synergistic H2&#8208;immunotherapy. The obtained MnG can be etched by water, enabling efficient and sustained generation of H2 gas and Mn2+. MnG not only activated and amplified the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway through the sustained release of Mn2+ but also regulated tumor glucose metabolism to inhibit the expression of three prime repair exonuclease 2 (TREX2), thereby synergistically enhancing the activation of the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway. The injection of MnG into tumors resulted in a robust immune response, thereby providing favorable support for antitumor therapy. Consequently, the combination of MnG with immune checkpoint blockade therapy resulted in significant suppression of both primary tumors and distant tumors. Furthermore, the MnG&#8208;lipiodol dispersion exhibited remarkable efficacy in combination with transarterial embolization (TAE)&#8208;gas&#8208;immunotherapy in a rabbit orthotopic liver tumor model. The present study underscores the significance of employing a metal galvanic cell strategy for enhanced immunotherapy, thereby offering a novel approach for rational design of bioactive materials to augment immunotherapeutic effectiveness.

         <title>Controlling Ion Uptake in Carboxylated Mixed Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of p&#8208;channel carboxylated mixed conductors is investigated to advance understanding and design strategies toward next&#8208;generation OMIEC systems. Varying side&#8208;chain functionality, distinctive swelling character during electrochemical doping/dedoping with model chao&#8208;/kosmotropic electrolytes is uncovered. As revealed for the first time through operando grazing incidence X&#8208;ray fluorescence studies, carboxyl functionalization leads to robust cation interactions, mitigating swelling.








Abstract
Organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) have garnered significant attention due to their capacity to transport both ions and electrons, making them ideal for applications in energy storage, neuromorphics, and bioelectronics. However, charge compensation mechanisms during the polymer redox process remain poorly understood, and are often oversimplified as single&#8208;ion injection with little attention to counterion effects. To advance understanding and design strategies toward next&#8208;generation OMIEC systems, a series of p&#8208;channel carboxylated mixed conductors is investigated. Varying side&#8208;chain functionality, distinctive swelling character is uncovered during electrochemical doping/dedoping with model chao&#8208;/kosmotropic electrolytes. Carboxylic acid functionalized polymers demonstrate strong deswelling and mass reduction during doping, indicating cation expulsion, while ethoxycarbonyl counterparts exhibit prominent mass increase, pointing to an anion&#8208;driven doping mechanism. By employing operando grazing incidence X&#8208;ray fluorescence (GIXRF), it is revealed that the carboxyl functionalized polymer engages in robust cation interaction, whereas ester functionalization shifts the mechanism towards no cation involvement. It is demonstrated that cations are pivotal in mitigating swelling by counterbalancing anions, enabling efficient anion uptake without compromising performance. These findings underscore the transformative influence of functionality&#8208;driven factors and side&#8208;chain chemistry in governing ion dynamics and conduction, providing new frameworks for designing OMIECs with enhanced performance and reduced swelling.

         <title>The sp Hybridization of Tin Single Atoms for Dendrite&#8208;Free Sodium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The construction of dendrite&#8208;free Na anodes via the universal synthesis of the fourth main group single&#8208;atom materials (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization is demonstrated. The in situ observation and theoretical calculations essentially disclose that the 5s25p2
 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G surface enables the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters, thereby suppressing the growth of dendrites.









Abstract
Restricting the growth of sodium (Na) dendrites at the atomic level is the premise to enable both the stability and safety of sodium metal batteries (SMBs). Here, the universal synthesis of the fourth main group element (Sn, Ge, Pb) as single metal atoms anchored on graphene (Sn, Ge, Pb SAs/G) with sp hybridization for dendrite&#8208;free sodium metal anode is reported. The in situ real&#8208;time observation of Na growth on Sn SAs/G uncoils a kinetically uniform planar deposition at the atomic level for substantially suppressing the dendrite growth. The symmetrical Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na battery exhibits high Coulombic efficiency of 99.8% for 200 cycles, long&#8208;term cyclability with 600&#160;h at 4&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, and ultralow overpotential of 40&#160;mV at 8&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Further, the full batteries Na3V2(PO4)3||Sn SAs/G&#8208;Na show unprecedented rate capability of 67 mAh g&#8722;1 at 20 C and a capacity retention as high as 91% after 500 cycles. The theoretical calculations of Na deposition on different M SAs/G (M&#9552;Sn, Ni, Zn, Fe, Co) reveal that the 5s
25p
2 electron configuration of Sn SAs/G realizes the planar deposition mechanism of Na clusters along the graphene plane. Therefore, this work provides an atom&#8208;level accurate miniaturization strategy for constructing dendrite&#8208;free SMBs.

         <title>Predicting the Mechanical Properties of Supramolecular Gels</title>

         <dc:description>
The prediction of gelation is an important target, yet current models do not predict any post&#8208;gel properties. Critically, it is the properties of the gels that are important for a specific application. Supramolecular gels are often kinetically trapped, meaning that predicting gel properties is inherently a difficult challenge. Here, the first successful a priori prediction of gel properties for such self&#8208;assembled, supramolecular systems is reported.








Abstract
The prediction of gelation is an important target, yet current models do not predict any post&#8208;gel properties. Gels can be formed through the self&#8208;assembly of many molecules, but close analogs often do not form gels. There has been success using a number of computational approaches to understand and predict gelation from molecular structures. However, these approaches focus on whether or not a gel will form, not on the properties of the resulting gels. Critically, it is the properties of the gels that are important for a specific application, not simply whether a gel will be formed. Supramolecular gels are often kinetically trapped, meaning that predicting gel properties is inherently a difficult challenge. Here, the first successful a priori prediction of gel properties for such self&#8208;assembled, supramolecular systems is reported.

         <title>A Multiresonant Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescent Dendrimer with Intramolecular Energy Transfer: Application for Efficient Host&#8208;Free Green Solution&#8208;Processed Organic Light&#8208;emitting Diodes</title>

An&#160;MR&#8208;TADF dendrimer, 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB, features an encapsulated MR&#8208;TADF core surrounded by a donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety containing donor dendrons. The non&#8208;doped SP&#8208;OLEDs with 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB exhibit narrowband green emission peaking at 495&#160;nm (FWHM of 30&#160;nm) and show an EQEmax at 24.0% and small efficiency roll&#8208;off, with EQE1000 of 20.2%.








Abstract
The development of narrowband emissive, bright, and stable solution&#8208;processed organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (SP&#8208;OLEDs) remains a challenge. Here, a strategy is presented that merges within a single emitter a TADF sensitizer responsible for exciton harvesting and an MR&#8208;TADF motif that provides bright and narrowband emission. This emitter design also shows strong resistance to aggregate formation and aggregation&#8208;cause quenching. It is based on a known MR&#8208;TADF emitter DtBuCzB with a donor&#8208;acceptor TADF moiety consisting of either tert&#8208;butylcarbazole donors (tBuCzCO2HDCzB) or second&#8208;generation carbazole&#8208;based donor dendrons (2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB) and a benzoate acceptor. The TADF moiety acts as an exciton harvesting antenna and transfers these excitons via F&#246;rster resonance energy transfer to the MR&#8208;TADF emissive core. The SP&#8208;OLEDs with 2GtBuCzCO2HDCzB and tBuCzCO2HDCzB thus show very high maximum external quantum efficiencies (EQEmax of 27.9 and 22.0%) and minimal efficiency roll&#8208;off out to 5000&#160;cd m&#8722;2.

         <title>Transforming Plastics to Single Atom Catalysts for Peroxymonosulfate Activation: Axial Chloride Coordination Intensified Electron Transfer Pathway</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene and applied in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation and water purification. Both experiments and density functional theory computations demonstrate that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tunes the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhances PMS activation because of improved carbon substrate conductivity and modulated spin state.








Abstract
Transforming plastics into single&#8208;atom catalysts is a promising strategy for upcycling waste plastics into value&#8208;added functional materials. Herein, a graphene&#8208;based single&#8208;atom catalyst with atomically dispersed FeN4Cl sites (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C) is produced from high&#8208;density polyethylene wastes via one&#8208;pot catalytic pyrolysis. The Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst exhibited much higher turnover frequency and surface area normalized activity (Kac) compared with the Fe&#9472;N&#9472;C catalyst without axial Cl modulation. Both experiments and density functional theory (DFT) computations demonstrated that the axial incorporation of chloride fine&#8208;tuned the coordination environment of FeN4 sites and enhanced peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation because of improved conductivity and modulated spin state. In situ, Raman, and infrared spectroscopic techniques revealed that PMS is activated by the Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C catalyst through an electron transfer process. The formation of a key PMS* intermediate at the Fe site effectively elevated the redox capacity of the catalyst surface to realize a fast degradation of diverse pollutants. The non&#8208;radical oxidation manner secures high selectivity toward target pollutants and high chemical utilization efficiency. A continuous operation in a column reactor also demonstrated the high efficiency and stability of the (Fe&#9472;N/Cl&#9472;C + PMS) system for practical water treatment.

         <title>Reversible Nanocomposite by Programming Amorphous Polymer Conformation Under Nanoconfinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by how protein folding and hierarchical structures are synergized in biocomposites for function gain, nanoconfinements are utilized to modulate how polymers are entangled and disentangled within polymer&#8208;grafted&#8208;nanoparticle (PGNP) assemblies to form pseudo bonds and thus, engineer high&#8208;performance, reversible single component nanocomposites.








Abstract
Nanoconfinements are utilized to program how polymers entangle and disentangle as chain clusters to engineer pseudo bonds with tunable strength, multivalency, and directionality. When amorphous polymers are grafted to nanoparticles that are one magnitude larger in size than individual polymers, programming grafted chain conformations can &#8220;synthesize&#8221; high&#8208;performance nanocomposites with moduli of &#8776;25GPa and a circular lifecycle without forming and/or breaking chemical bonds. These nanocomposites dissipate external stresses by disentangling and stretching grafted polymers up to &#8776;98% of their contour length, analogous to that of folded proteins; use both polymers and nanoparticles for load bearing; and exhibit a non&#8208;linear dependence on composition throughout the microscopic, nanoscopic, and single&#8208;particle levels.

         <title>Passive Isothermal Flexible Sensor Enabled by Smart Thermal&#8208;Regulating Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A passive isothermal flexible sensor enabled by radiative cooling and heat insulation for adapting dynamic thermal conditions is demonstrated. In summer, when solar radiation is high, PDRC prevails and achieves radiative cooling. Conversely, ambient temperature is low in winter, and the thermal insulation reduces heat loss. The prepared sensor can maintain the working temperature over a temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Environmentally induced sensor temperature fluctuations can distort the outputs of a sensor, reducing their stability during long&#8208;term health monitoring. Here, a passive isothermal flexible sensor is proposed by using hierarchical cellulose aerogel (HCA) as the top tribonegative layer, which allows the sensor to adapt dynamic thermal environments through both radiative cooling and heat insulation. The radiative cooling effect can cool down the temperatures of a sensor in summer, while the hollow microfibers in HCA provide ultralow thermal conductivity to reduce internal heat loss in winter. The prepared passive isothermal sensor is capable of maintaining the rated working temperature over an extensive temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating for gripping hot and cold objects. While monitoring human movements under direct sunlight, the temperature of a conventional sensor rose by 12.3&#160;&#176;C, whereas the sensor experienced an increase of only 0.3&#160;&#176;C. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for adapting to environments, enabling wearable electronics to function effectively in dynamic thermal conditions.

     alt="Passive Isothermal Flexible Sensor Enabled by Smart Thermal-Regulating Aerogels"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A passive isothermal flexible sensor enabled by radiative cooling and heat insulation for adapting dynamic thermal conditions is demonstrated. In summer, when solar radiation is high, PDRC prevails and achieves radiative cooling. Conversely, ambient temperature is low in winter, and the thermal insulation reduces heat loss. The prepared sensor can maintain the working temperature over a temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Environmentally induced sensor temperature fluctuations can distort the outputs of a sensor, reducing their stability during long-term health monitoring. Here, a passive isothermal flexible sensor is proposed by using hierarchical cellulose aerogel (HCA) as the top tribonegative layer, which allows the sensor to adapt dynamic thermal environments through both radiative cooling and heat insulation. The radiative cooling effect can cool down the temperatures of a sensor in summer, while the hollow microfibers in HCA provide ultralow thermal conductivity to reduce internal heat loss in winter. The prepared passive isothermal sensor is capable of maintaining the rated working temperature over an extensive temperature range of 0&#8722;100&#160;&#176;C, demonstrating for gripping hot and cold objects. While monitoring human movements under direct sunlight, the temperature of a conventional sensor rose by 12.3&#160;&#176;C, whereas the sensor experienced an increase of only 0.3&#160;&#176;C. Therefore, this work presents a promising strategy for adapting to environments, enabling wearable electronics to function effectively in dynamic thermal conditions.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Imine&#8208;Linked 3D Covalent Organic Framework Membrane Featuring Highly Charged Sub&#8208;1&#160;nm Channels for Exceptional Lithium&#8208;Ion Sieving</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ growth of a consecutive, intact imine&#8208;linked three&#8208;dimensional&#160;covalent organic framework (3D&#8208;COF) layer on the polymeric membrane enables efficient lithium&#8208;ion extraction, wherein highly&#8208;charged sub&#8208;1 nm channels employing size exclusion effect and ion affinity differences ensure high Li+/Mg2+ selectivity and fast Li+ flux.








Abstract
Coupling ion exclusion and interaction screening within sub&#8208;nanoconfinement channels in novel porous material membranes hold great potential to realize highly efficient ion sieving, particularly for high&#8208;performance lithium&#8208;ion extraction. Diverse kinds of advanced membranes have been previously reported to realize this goal but with moderate performance and complex operations gained. Herein, these issues are circumvented by preparing the consecutive and intact imine&#8208;linked three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framework&#160;(i.e., COF&#8208;300) membranes via a simple solvothermal approach and employing the intrinsically interconnected sub&#8208;1&#160;nm one&#8208;dimensional channels for exceptional lithium&#8208;ion sieving. The synthesized membranes with highly charged angstrom scale channels of &#8776;0.78&#160;nm achieve an excellent Li+ permeance (0.123&#160;mol m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) with an ultrahigh Li+/Mg2+ of 36 in the binary system. The experimental measurement and theoretical calculation reveal that a channel size right exactly between Li+ and Mg2+ enables restricted Mg2+ penetration. Meanwhile, the ion affinity interaction screening with imine groups further strengthens the fast Li+ permeability but severely suppresses the Mg2+ passage. In particular, the synthesized three&#8208;dimensional covalent organic framwork membranes also have a remarkable separation performance during a long&#8208;term operation test without sacrificing trade&#8208;off, demonstrating chemistry stability and mechanical integrity under the high&#8208;salinity aqueous environment.

         <title>Riveting Nucleation Enabled Long Cycling Life Calcium Metal Anodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Na metal mediator preferentially rivets the plating/stripping of the Ca metal anode on carbon substrates, endowing the Ca metal anode with an unprecedented cycling life, high coulombic efficiency, and rate capability.








Abstract
Calcium metal batteries with high capacity and low cost are promising alternatives to Li&#8208;ion batteries for large&#8208;scale energy storage. However, its development is crucially impeded by the irreversible Ca metal anode, which is highly associated with uncontrollable Ca plating/stripping. Here, we report a new riveting strategy to regulate the nucleation and growth of a Ca metal anode in the 3D structure of a carbon nanotube film (CNF) by introducing in situ&#8208;formed Na metal mediators. Na metal mediators are found to first deposit in the CNF substrate prior to Ca nucleation and subsequently induce dense and uniform Ca plating due to their thermodynamically favorable kinetics. Therefore, even at a high current density of 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and a high capacity of 5 mAh cm&#8722;2, it realizes the uniform nucleation and growth of dendrite&#8208;free Ca metal. Moreover, an unprecedented cycling life of over 800 cycles is also achieved for Ca metal batteries with a high coulombic efficiency above 98.4%. This work demonstrates the significance of a riveting strategy to enable the superior performance of Ca metal batteries by regulating the plating/stripping behaviors of Ca metal anodes and paves a new way for the development of Ca metal batteries.

         <title>Bioinspired Liquid Pockets with Externally Induced Internal Microscale Flow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A bioinspired liquid pockets material with an externally activated unit induces internal microscale to flow through the reversible transfer of interflowing fluid within interconnected pockets, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. This material exhibits a new pathway for regulating flow at responsive material interfaces, supporting applications such as sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, antifouling, and anti&#8208;swelling.








Abstract
The gastric mucosal barrier, through its gastric pits, serves as a pathway for secretions, ensuring that mucus produced by the gastric glands is transferred to the gastric lumen, providing stable protection. Here a bioinspired liquid pockets material is shown, composed of a thermo&#8208;driven hydrogel that acts as an external activation unit to release interflowing liquid responsively, and porous matrices that serve as interconnected pockets to transfer it, enabling controlled internal flow and adaptive barrier functionality. Experiments and theoretical analysis demonstrate the stability and regulatory mechanisms of these liquid pockets, based on the interconnected pockets between the external activation unit and internal fluid flow. It exhibits a new pathway for regulating microscale flow at responsive material interfaces, enabling applications from sequential drug release, self&#8208;cleaning, and antifouling to anti&#8208;swelling. These unique capabilities address long&#8208;standing challenges in microscale flow control, with potential impacts in diverse fields including microfluidics, drug delivery, medical devices, 3D printing, and beyond.

         <title>Programmable Magnetic Hysteresis in Orthogonally&#8208;Twisted 2D CrSBr Magnets via Stacking Engineering.</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Twisting and stacking are key for engineering twisted 2D magnets, as shown here by stacking pristine monolayers and bilayers of CrSBr with a twist&#8208;angle of 90&#176;. By creating symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) twisted heterostructures, the switch between volatile and non&#8208;volatile magnetic memory at zero&#8208;field and the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes and hysteresis&#160;are controlled on demand.









Abstract
Twisting 2D van der Waals magnets allows the formation and control of different spin&#8208;textures, as skyrmions or magnetic domains. Beyond the rotation angle, different spin reversal processes can be engineered by increasing the number of magnetic layers forming the twisted van der Waals heterostructure. Here, pristine monolayers and bilayers of the A&#8208;type antiferromagnet CrSBr are considered as building blocks. By rotating 90 degrees these units, symmetric (monolayer/monolayer and bilayer/bilayer) and asymmetric (monolayer/bilayer) heterostructures are fabricated. The magneto&#8208;transport properties reveal the appearance of magnetic hysteresis, which is highly dependent upon the magnitude and direction of the applied magnetic field and is determined not only by the twist&#8208;angle but also by the number of layers forming the stack. This high tunability allows switching between volatile and non&#8208;volatile magnetic memory at zero&#8208;field and controlling the appearance of abrupt magnetic reversal processes at either negative or positive field values on demand. The phenomenology is rationalized based on the different spin&#8208;switching processes occurring in the layers, as supported by micromagnetic simulations. The results highlight the combination between twist&#8208;angle and number of layers as key elements for engineering spin&#8208;switching reversals in twisted magnets, of interest toward the miniaturization of spintronic devices and realizing novel spin textures.

Nanosensor with NIR&#8208;II fluorescence and photoacoustic imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. Animal experiments demonstrate that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq results reveal that diabetes may promote tumor growth by weaking immune response, inhibiting apoptosis, and promoting the expression of carcinogens related to Nos2.








Abstract
Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cause of cancer induced death worldwide. Current statistics has disclosed that the diabetic BC patients have significantly worse survival rate compared with nondiabetic BC patients. However, the specific mechanism is still being explored. Herein, a novel NIR&#8208;II nanosensor DNPS&#160;for nitric oxide (NO) with fluorescence/photoacoustic (FL/PA)&#160;imaging capability is developed to explore the mechanism by which diabetes promoting breast cancer progression. In diabetic BC model, DNPS exhibits great advantages of low intrinsic background, high sensitivity, and deep tissue penetration and successfully confirmed the expression level of NO is higher than BC model, indicating that diabetes causes elevated nitric oxide levels in the tumor microenvironment. RNA&#8208;seq analysis results show&#160;that hyperglycemia caused by diabetes leads to weakened immune response and initiates the transcription and translation of the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene to produce NO. Besides, the increased expression of carcinogens related to Nitric oxide synthase 2 (Nos2), such as Spp1, Mmp11, and Kitl, causes breast cancer to develop more rapidly. Here, NIR&#8208;II imaging probe is applied first&#160;to study diabetes&#8208;related breast cancer and certain reference value is provided for subsequent research on the mechanism of diabetes promoting the progression of breast cancer.

         <title>Optical Activity of Chiral Excitons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective mass model of excitons in chiral semiconductors is presented, accounting for parity mixing resulting from polar distortions, resulting in allowed magnetic dipole transitions. In a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, circular dichroism is shown to emerge via cross&#8208;coupling of Rashba&#8208;like and chiral/helical spin&#8208;texture components, while in perovskite nanocrystals, chiroptical properties are not contingent on chiral lattice distortions.









Abstract
Recent activity in the area of chiroptical phenomena has been focused on the connection between structural asymmetry, electron spin configuration and light/matter interactions in chiral semiconductors. In these systems, spin&#8208;splitting phenomena emerge due to inversion symmetry breaking and the presence of extended electronic states, yet the connection to chiroptical phenomena is lacking. Here, we develop an analytical effective mass model of chiral excitons, parameterized by density functional theory. The model accounts for parity mixing of the band edge Bloch functions resulting from polar distortions, resulting in allowed magnetic dipole transitions. Through the study of a prototypical chiral 2D hybrid perovskite semiconductor, we show that circular dichroism of the chiral exciton and its interband continuum emerges from spin&#8208;splitting via cross&#8208;coupling of Rashba&#8208;like and chiral/helical spin&#8208;texture components. To demonstrate the generality of our approach, and as a counterpoint, we apply our model to describe chiroptical properties of three&#8208;dimensionally confined excitons in perovskite nanocrystals that occur without chiral lattice distortions.

         <title>Constructing the Dirac Electronic Behavior Database of Under&#8208;Stress Transition Metal Dichalcogenides for Broad Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing advanced technology to efficiently screen the Dirac materials in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is highly critical for achieving advanced photoelectric properties. This work reports the establishment of a comprehensive database including 90 types of TMDCs and investigates their response behaviors under external strains regarding the presence of Dirac cones and electronic structure evolutions, supplying information from electronic perspectives.








Abstract
Discovering and utilizing the unique optoelectronic properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) is of great significance for developing next&#8208;generation electronic devices. In particular, research on Dirac state modulations of TMDCs under external strains is lacking. To fill this research gap, it has established a comprehensive database of 90 types of TMDCs and their response behaviors under external strains have been systematically investigated regarding the presence of Dirac cones and electronic structure evolutions. Among all the conditions, 27.3% of the TMDCs are Dirac materials with three distinct types of Dirac cones, which are mainly attributed to the electron localizations induced by external strains. TMDCs based on tellurides with 1H phase favor the formation of Dirac cones under stresses, leading to metallic&#8208;like properties and ultra&#8208;fast charge transportation. Correlations among Dirac cones, energy, electronic properties, and lattice structures have been revealed, offering critical references for modulating the properties of well&#8208;known TMDCs. More importantly, it has confirmed that the phase transition points are not sufficient for the appearance of Dirac cones. This work provides critical guidance to facilitate the development of TMDCs&#8208;based superconducting and optoelectronic devices for broad applications.

         <title>Ultrafast Lithium&#8208;Ion Transport Engineered by Nanoconfinement Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultrafast ion transport behavior based on the nanoconfinement effect has been explored. Utilizing nanochannels of graphene oxide laminar membranes (GOLMs), the Li+ ionic conductivity exceeding 102 mS cm&#8722;1 is realized, one to three orders of magnitude higher than traditional liquid or solid lithium&#8208;ion electrolytes. These results inspire the development of ultrafast ion transport for efficient energy storage applications.








Abstract
Amid the burgeoning demand for electrochemical energy storage and neuromorphic computing, fast ion transport behavior has attracted widespread attention at both fundamental and practical levels. Here, based on the nanoconfined channel of graphene oxide laminar membranes (GOLMs), the lithium ionic conductivity typically exceeding 102 mS cm&#8722;1 is realized, one to three orders of magnitude higher than traditional liquid or solid lithium&#8208;ion electrolyte. Specifically, the nanoconfined lithium hexafluorophosphate (LiPF6)&#8208;ethylene carbonate (EC)/ dimethyl carbonate (DMC) electrolyte demonstrates the ionic conductivity of 170 mS cm&#8722;1, outperforming the bulk counterpart by &#8776;16 fold. At the ultralow temperature of &#8722;60&#160;&#176;C, the nanoconfined electrolyte also maintains a practically useful conductivity of 11 mS cm&#8722;1. Furthermore, the in situ experimental and theoretical framework enables to attribute the enhanced ionic conductivity to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer cations and anions distribution induced by high surface charge and nanoconfinement effects in GO nanochannels. More importantly, integrating such rapid lithium&#8208;ion transport nanochannel into the LiFePO4 (LFP) cathode significantly improves the high&#8208;rate and long&#8208;cycle performance of lithium batteries. These results exhibit the convention&#8208;breaking ionic conductivity of nanoconfined electrolytes, inspiring the development of ultrafast ion diffusion pathways based on 2D nanoconfined channels for efficient energy storage applications.

         <title>Two&#8208;dimensional Nanosheets by Liquid Metal Exfoliation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the liquid gallium is used to exfoliate bulk layered materials into 2D nanosheets at near room temperature. This method enables the production of numerous 2D nanosheets, including h&#8208;BN, graphene, layered minerals, and others, while avoiding the formation of additional defects and surfactant contamination. By adjusting the initial defect levels of the layered materials, the metallicity and/or defectiveness of 2D NSs can be customized for different applications.








Abstract
Liquid exfoliation is a scalable and effective method for synthesizing 2D nanosheets (NSs) but often induces contamination and defects. Here, liquid metal gallium (Ga) is used to exfoliate bulk layered materials into 2D NSs at near room temperature, utilizing the liquid surface tension and Ga intercalation to disrupt Van der Waals (vdW) forces. In addition, the process can transform the 2H&#8208;phase of transition metal dichalcogenides into the 1T&#8217;&#8208;phase under ambient conditions. This method produces high aspect ratio, surfactant&#8208;free 2D&#8208;NSs for more than 10 types of 2D materials that include h&#8208;BN, graphene, MoTe2, MoSe2, layered minerals, etc. The subsequent Ga separation via ethanol dispersion avoids the formation of additional defects and surfactant contamination. By adjusting initial defect levels of the layered materials, customize the metallicity and/or defectiveness of 2D NSs can be customized for applications such as birefringence&#8208;tunable modulators with exfoliated h&#8208;BN, and enhanced hydrogen evolution with defective MoS2.

&lt;p&gt;In this work, the liquid gallium is used to exfoliate bulk layered materials into 2D nanosheets at near room temperature. This method enables the production of numerous 2D nanosheets, including h-BN, graphene, layered minerals, and others, while avoiding the formation of additional defects and surfactant contamination. By adjusting the initial defect levels of the layered materials, the metallicity and/or defectiveness of 2D NSs can be customized for different applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Liquid exfoliation is a scalable and effective method for synthesizing 2D nanosheets (NSs) but often induces contamination and defects. Here, liquid metal gallium (Ga) is used to exfoliate bulk layered materials into 2D NSs at near room temperature, utilizing the liquid surface tension and Ga intercalation to disrupt Van der Waals (vdW) forces. In addition, the process can transform the 2H-phase of transition metal dichalcogenides into the 1T&#8217;-phase under ambient conditions. This method produces high aspect ratio, surfactant-free 2D-NSs for more than 10 types of 2D materials that include h-BN, graphene, MoTe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, layered minerals, etc. The subsequent Ga separation via ethanol dispersion avoids the formation of additional defects and surfactant contamination. By adjusting initial defect levels of the layered materials, customize the metallicity and/or defectiveness of 2D NSs can be customized for applications such as birefringence-tunable modulators with exfoliated h-BN, and enhanced hydrogen evolution with defective MoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This approach offers a strategy to optimize liquid metal/2D interfaces, preserving intrinsic properties and enabling practical applications, potentially transforming optics, energy conversion, and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Prussian Blue Analogues &#8220;Dressed&#8221; in MXene Nanosheets Tightly for High Performance Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>

By intelligent adjusting the dimensions of the MXene nanosheets, the Co&#8208;PBA@MXene heterostructures are successfully prepared with core&#8212;shell&#8208;like structures, which are different from the common sandwich&#8208;like structures and exhibited enhanced electrochemical performance in LIBs. This study will promotes the development of the synthesis of MXene&#8208;based hybrids, which have broad application prospects.









Abstract
MXenes, have been considered as a new generation anode material in lithium&#8208;ion batteries for lower lithium&#8208;ion diffusion barriers and superior conductivity. Unfortunately, their structures are prone to aggregation and stacking, hindering further shuttle of lithium ions and electrons, resulting in lower discharge capacity. Therefore, the introduction of interlayer spacers for the preparation of MXene&#8208;based hybrids has attracted much attention. Introducing Prubssian blue analogues (PBAs) as a new interlayer spacer to combine with MXene nanosheets can not only preserve the high conductivity of MXene and inhibit the volume expansion and structural degradation of the PBA component, but also inherit the characteristics of large specific surface area and high porosity of PBAs. By intelligent regulating the size of MXene sheets, Co&#8208;PBA@MXene hybrids with common sandwich&#8208;like structures and superior core&#8208;shell&#8208;like structures have been successfully obtained. Furthermore, Co@M(x:y) hybrids are prepared by intelligently adjusting the shell thickness of MXene through intelligently controlling of the mass ratio between Co&#8208;PBA and MXene. Among them, the Co@M(5:2) anode exhibits an excellent capacity (603&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1 after 100 cycles) and superior long&#8208;term cycling stability due to the protective and conductive properties provided by the MXene shell and multi&#8208;redox pairs and rich porosity from Co&#8208;PBA core.

         <title>PO43&#8722; Tetrahedron Assisted Chelate Engineering for 10.67%&#8208;Efficient Antimony Selenosulfide Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>

[hk0] orientation and complex deep&#8208;level defects of Sb2(S,Se)3 film limit carrier transport in solar cells. In this work, tetrahedral ions are innovatively employed to regulate the reaction kinetics and optimize the growth orientation and defects. Thus, the tetrahedral PO43&#8208; can induce desirable [hk1] orientation and defect passivation, which delivers a 10.67% efficiency.








Abstract
Anisotropic carrier transport and deep&#8208;level defect of antimony selenosulfide (Sb2(S,Se)3) absorber are two vital auses restraining the photovoltaic performance of this emerging thin&#8208;film solar cell. Herein, chelate engineering is proposed to prepare high&#8208;quality Sb2(S,Se)3 film based on hydrothermal deposition approach, which realizes desirable carrier transport and passivated defects by using tetrahedral PO43&#8722; ion in dibasic sodium phosphate (Na2HPO4, DSP). The PO43&#8722; Lewis structure, on one hand in the form of [(SbO)3(PO4)] chelate, can adsorb on the polar planes of cadmium sulfide (CdS) layer, promoting the heterogeneous nucleation, and on the other hand, the tetrahedral PO43&#8722; inhibits horizontal growth of (Sb4S(e)6)n ribbons due to size effects, thus achieving desirable [hk1] orientation. Moreover, the introduction PO43&#8722; effectively passivates the antisite defect SbS1. These synergistic effects have effectively improved carrier transport and reduced non&#8208;radiative recombination of the Sb2(S,Se)3 absorber. Consequently, the DSP&#8208;modified Sb2(S,Se)3 device efficiency increases from 8.59% to 10.67%.

         <title>A Chain Entanglement Gelled SnO&#8322; Electron Transport Layer for Enhanced Perovskite Solar Cell Performance and Effective Lead Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By incorporating DAES&#8208;PVP polymer and LiCl into a SnO2 aqueous solution, an in situ polymerized, chain&#8208;entangled SnO2 electron transport layer is developed. This approach resulted in a perovskite solar cell with a power conversion efficiency of 24.77% and enhanced stability. Additionally, the new SnO2 layer demonstrated significant lead protection effects.








Abstract
SnO&#8322; is a widely used electron transport layer (ETL) material in perovskite solar cells (PSCs), and its design and optimization are essential for achieving efficient and stable PSCs. In this study, the in situ formation of a chain entanglement gel polymer electrolyte is reported in an aqueous phase, integrated with SnO&#8322; as the ETL. Based on the self&#8208;polymerization of 3&#8208;[[2&#8208;(methacryloyloxy)ethyl]dimethylammonium]propane&#8208;1&#8208;sulfonic acid (DAES) in an aqueous environment, combining the catalytic effect of LiCl (as a Lewis acid) with the salting&#8208;out effect, and the introduction of polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) as the other polymer chain, a chain entanglement gelled SnO2 (G&#8208;SnO2) structure is successfully constructed with a wide range of functions. The PDEAS&#8208;PVP chain entanglement gel achieves passivation and Pb2&#8314; capture through chemical chelation mechanisms is explored. The results demonstrated that the all&#8208;in&#8208;air prepared PSC based on G&#8208;SnO2 exhibited an excellent power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 24.77% and retained 83.3% of their initial efficiency after 2100 h of air exposure. Additionally, the PDEAS&#8208;PVP exposes more C&#9552;O and S&#9552;O active sites, significantly enhanced the lead absorption capability of the PSCs.

         <title>Mechanical&#8208;Stimuli&#8208;Driven Pseudo&#8208;Conductive Channels Along Dielectric Heterojunction Interfaces for Mechanoelectric Energy Conversion and Transmission</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Comparison of conventional mechano&#8208;electric devices and mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven pseudo&#8208;conductive (MSPC) devices, illustrating the behavior of charge carriers and dipoles responding to mechanical stimulation and under energy band diagrams. MSPC devices exploit charge accumulation at dielectric junctions to establish in&#8208;plane pathways for mobility, enabling robust electrical signal transmission across long distances without conductive materials, which is not achievable with conventional devices.








Abstract
Mechanoelectric energy conversion holds promise for energy conversion and transmission devices, yet conventional configurations rely on large&#8208;area conductive materials in active regions, limiting architectural design for cutting&#8208;edge devices. Here, a rational strategy is reported to create mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven pseudo&#8208;conductive (MSPC) channels entirely from dielectric materials, eliminating the need for electrodes in active regions. An in&#8208;depth investigation of MSPC channel formation mechanism at dielectric interfaces is conducted, employing energy band analyses. Following the mechanical stimuli&#8208;driven charging process, MSPC device effectively transmits electrical signals over 42&#160;mm, achieving remarkable 512% enhancement compared to its pristine state. Control devices with non&#8208;continuous dielectric configurations highlight the impact of heterojunction interfaces on MSPC channels. A resistor&#8211;capacitor charging test reveals up to 49% reduction in voltage change rate, indicating a substantial decrease in electrical impedance along the MSPC channel. Furthermore, MSPC devices demonstrate information transmission capabilities, such as sequences of bits or letters, utilizing solely dielectric configurations.

     alt="Mechanical-Stimuli-Driven Pseudo-Conductive Channels Along Dielectric Heterojunction Interfaces for Mechanoelectric Energy Conversion and Transmission"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Comparison of conventional mechano-electric devices and mechanical stimuli-driven pseudo-conductive (MSPC) devices, illustrating the behavior of charge carriers and dipoles responding to mechanical stimulation and under energy band diagrams. MSPC devices exploit charge accumulation at dielectric junctions to establish in-plane pathways for mobility, enabling robust electrical signal transmission across long distances without conductive materials, which is not achievable with conventional devices.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanoelectric energy conversion holds promise for energy conversion and transmission devices, yet conventional configurations rely on large-area conductive materials in active regions, limiting architectural design for cutting-edge devices. Here, a rational strategy is reported to create mechanical stimuli-driven pseudo-conductive (MSPC) channels entirely from dielectric materials, eliminating the need for electrodes in active regions. An in-depth investigation of MSPC channel formation mechanism at dielectric interfaces is conducted, employing energy band analyses. Following the mechanical stimuli-driven charging process, MSPC device effectively transmits electrical signals over 42&#160;mm, achieving remarkable 512% enhancement compared to its pristine state. Control devices with non-continuous dielectric configurations highlight the impact of heterojunction interfaces on MSPC channels. A resistor&#8211;capacitor charging test reveals up to 49% reduction in voltage change rate, indicating a substantial decrease in electrical impedance along the MSPC channel. Furthermore, MSPC devices demonstrate information transmission capabilities, such as sequences of bits or letters, utilizing solely dielectric configurations. This study paves the way to reduce conductive materials of wearable electronics, biomedical implants, and IoT technologies, overcoming significant challenges such as potential electrical shortages, design inflexibility, limited manufacturing scalability, and maintenance issues.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Leech&#8208;Inspired Amphibious Soft Robot Driven by High&#8208;Voltage Triboelectricity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;performance, temperature&#8208;controllable, and high&#8208;voltage DC triboelectric nanogenerator (HDC&#8208;TENG) is proposed. This HDC&#8208;TENG is used to develop a triboelectric bionic robot driving system (TEBR), which stably drives and controls leech&#8208;inspired dielectric elastomer robots (LSR). With the TEBR, the LSR achieves amphibious motion, payload crawling, and small&#8208;slope climbing through the design of extensible dielectric elastomer muscle segments.








Abstract
Leech locomotion, characterized by alternating sucker attachment and body contraction provides&#160;high adaptability and stability on complex terrains. Herein, a leech&#8208;inspired triboelectric soft robot is proposed for the first time, capable of amphibious movement, climbing, and load&#8208;carrying crawling. A high&#8208;performance triboelectric bionic robot system is developed to drive and control electro&#8208;responsive soft robots. Its core components include: i) a leech&#8208;inspired soft robot (LSR) made from segmented dielectric elastomer muscles. ii) The triboelectric sucker produces anisotropic frictional forces. iii) The multi&#8208;channel high&#8208;voltage&#160;output triboelectric nanogenerator (HDC&#8208;TENG) effectively drives the LSR. iv) The high&#8208;voltage triboelectric control unit adapted for the HDC&#8208;TENG enables flexible LSR control. Using the scalable structure of the dielectric elastomer muscles enables the LSR to achieve&#160;a maximum crawling speed of 0.39 body lengths per minute on land (45 mm min&#8722;1) and 0.22 body lengths per minute in liquid (30.5 mm min&#8722;1). It can also carry a payload of 11.55 grams on acrylic while crawling. This research provides a sustainable and promising new solution for self&#8208;powered high&#8208;voltage energy sources suitable for electro&#8208;responsive soft robots.

         <title>Linear Enhanced 3D Nanofluid Force&#8208;Electric Conversion Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D ANF/CNF nanofluidic membrane is developed for using a passive linear force&#8208;electric conversion device, which demonstrates high flux, high porosity, and short ion transport path, overcoming the limitation of the inherent trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity in traditional 1D and 2D membranes. This work provides valuable insights for future research on highly sensitive force sensors.








Abstract
The inherent trade&#8208;off between permeability and selectivity has constrained further improvement of passive linear force&#8208;electric conversion performance in nanofluidic pressure sensors. To overcome this limitation, a 3D nanofluidic membrane with high mechanical strength utilizing aramid nanofibers/carbon nanofiber (ANF/CNF) dual crosslinking is developed. Due to the abundant surface functional groups of CNF and the high mechanical strength of ANF, this large&#8208;scale integrated 3D nanofluidic membrane exhibits advantages of high flux, high porosity, and short ion transport path, demonstrating superior force&#8208;electric response compared to conventional 1D and 2D configurations. The enhancement mechanism of the ANF/CNF membrane is systematically investigated through experimental results and theoretical calculations. The optimized device has a sensitivity of 111 nA cm&#8722;2&#160;kPa&#8722;1, a response/recovery time of 63/68&#160;ms, and a stability of 45&#160;000 cycles. This study successfully overcomes the inherent performance limitations of traditional nanofluidic membranes, offering promising potential for applications across artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and smart wearable devices.

         <title>Programmable Electromagnetic Wave Absorption via Tailored Metal Single Atom&#8208;Support Interactions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper proposes a methodology that emphasizes precise control of single atom&#8208;graphene interactions to address electromagnetic interference challenges, the methodology includes material selection, material preparation, and structure&#8211;activity correlation analysis, and ultimately leads to the establishment of programmable electromagnetic wave absorption properties through the creation of a library of diverse single atom&#8208;graphene materials.








Abstract
Metal single atoms (SA)&#8208;support interactions inherently exhibit significant electrochemical activity, demonstrating potential in energy catalysis. However, leveraging these interactions to modulate electronic properties and extend application fields is a formidable challenge, demanding in&#8208;depth understanding and quantitative control of atomic&#8208;scale interactions. Herein, in situ, off&#8208;axis electron holography technique is utilized to directly visualize the interactions between SAs and the graphene surface. These interactions facilitate the formation of dispersed nanoscale regions with high charge density and are highly sensitive to external electromagnetic (EM) fields, resulting in controllable dynamic relaxation processes for charge accumulation and restoration. This leads to customized dielectric relaxation, which is difficult to achieve with current band engineering methods. Moreover, these electronic behaviors are insensitive to elevated temperatures, having characteristics distinct from those of typical metallic or semiconducting materials. Based on these results, programmable EM wave absorption properties are achieved by developing a library of SA&#8208;graphene materials and precisely controlling SA&#8208;support interactions to tailor their responses to EM waves in terms of frequency and intensity. This advancement addresses the customized anti&#8208;EM interference requirements of electronic components, greatly enhancing the development of integrated circuits and micro&#8208;nano chips. Future efforts will concentrate on manipulating atomic interactions in SA&#8208;support, potentially revolutionizing nanoelectronics and optoelectronics.

         <title>Enhanced Cooperative Generalized Compressive Strain and Electronic Structure Engineering in W&#8208;Ni3N for Efficient Hydrazine Oxidation Facilitating H2 Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents W&#8208;doped Ni3N as a bifunctional catalyst for hydrazine&#8208;assisted water electrolysis. Through compressive strain and electronic structure tuning via high&#8208;valence W doping, the catalyst exhibits enhanced HER and HzOR. W&#8208;doped Ni3N shows superior bifunctional performance with low overpotentials, offering an efficient alternative to conventional water electrolysis and addressing challenges of noble metal cost and sluggish kinetics.








Abstract
As promising bifunctional electrocatalysts, transition metal nitrides are expected to achieve an efficient hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR) by fine&#8208;tuning electronic structure via strain engineering, thereby facilitating hydrogen production. However, understanding the correlation between strain&#8208;induced atomic microenvironments and reactivity remains challenging. Herein, a generalized compressive strained W&#8208;Ni3N catalyst is developed to create a surface with enriched electronic states that optimize intermediate binding and activate both water and N2H4. Multi&#8208;dimensional characterizations reveal a nearly linear correlation between the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity and the d&#8208;band center of W&#8208;Ni3N under strain state. Theoretically, compressive strain enhances the electron transfer capability at the surface, increasing donation into antibonding orbitals of adsorbed species, which accelerates the HER and HzOR. Leveraging both compressive strain and the modified electronic structure from W incorporation, the W&#8208;Ni3N catalysts demonstrate outstanding bifunctional performance, achieving overpotentials of 46&#160;mV for HER at 10&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 and 81&#160;mV for HzOR at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2. Furthermore, W&#8208;Ni3N catalyst achieves efficient overall hydrazine splitting at a low cell voltage of 0.185&#160;V for 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, maintaining stability for &#8776;450 h. This work provides new insights into the dual engineering of strain and electronic structure in the design of advanced catalysts.

This work provides new insights into the dual engineering of strain and electronic structure in the design of advanced catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Ferroelectric Optical Memristors Enabled by Non&#8208;Volatile Electro&#8208;Optic Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes the development of a non&#8208;volatile optical memristor enabled by the electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect in ferroelectric PMN&#8208;PT, which supports deterministic, repeatable multilevel EO states for phase modulation. A tunable waveplate achieving phase shifts from 0 to &#960;/2 is presented, demonstrating the potential of relaxor ferroelectrics in non&#8208;volatile memory and photonic networks.








Abstract
Memristors enable non&#8208;volatile memory and neuromorphic computing. Optical memristors are the fundamental element for programmable photonic integrated circuits due to their high&#8208;bandwidth computing, low crosstalk, and minimal power consumption. Here, an optical memristor enabled by a non&#8208;volatile electro&#8208;optic (EO) effect, where refractive index modulation under zero field is realized by deliberate control of domain alignment in the ferroelectric material Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3&#8208;PbTiO3(PMN&#8208;PT) is proposed. The non&#8208;volatile EO memristor is designed exclusively for the modulation of the optical phase without degrading the optical transparency, and it allows the support for deterministic and repeated non&#8208;volatile multilevel EO states. A non&#8208;volatile tunable waveplate composed of the optical memrisor for free&#8208;space optics, which allows for deterministic multilevel, and non&#8208;volatile phase shifts from 0 to &#960;/2 is presented. The state switching rate of the memristor is less than 100&#160;ms, with a switching energy consumption of 234&#160;nJ, and the states can be retained for up to 12&#160;h without requiring static power consumption. These results demonstrate a novel approach to fully realizing non&#8208;volatile optical memristors, where only optical phase modulation is involved, providing unprecedented opportunities for the development of new ferroelectric memristors.

         <title>Interfacial Water Regulation for Nitrate Electroreduction to Ammonia at Ultralow Overpotentials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A hydroxide regulation strategy is proposed for optimizing the interfacial H2O behavior for accelerating the hydrogenation conversion of nitrate to ammonia at ultralow overpotentials. The well&#8208;designed Ru&#9472;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst exhibits a remarkable energy efficiency of 44.6% at +0.1 V vs. RHE and a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for NH3 synthesis at 0 V vs. RHE, outperforming state&#8208;of&#8208;art NO3&#8722;RR electrocatalysts.








Abstract
Nitrate electroreduction is promising for achieving effluent waste&#8208;water treatment and ammonia production with respect to the global nitrogen balance. However, due to the impeded hydrogenation process, high overpotentials need to be surmounted during nitrate electroreduction, causing intensive energy consumption. Herein, a hydroxide regulation strategy is developed to optimize the interfacial H2O behavior for accelerating the hydrogenation conversion of nitrate to ammonia at ultralow overpotentials. The well&#8208;designed Ru&#9472;Ni(OH)2 electrocatalyst shows a remarkable energy efficiency of 44.6% at +0.1&#160;V versus RHE and a nearly 100% Faradaic efficiency for NH3 synthesis at 0&#160;V versus RHE. In situ characterizations and theoretical calculations indicate that Ni(OH)2 can regulate the interfacial H2O structure with a promoted H2O dissociation process and contribute to the spontaneous hydrogen spillover process for boosting NO3&#8722; electroreduction to NH3 at Ru sites. Furthermore, the assembled rechargeable Zn&#8208;NO3&#8722;/ethanol battery system exhibits an outstanding long&#8208;term cycling stability during the charge&#8211;discharge tests with the production of high&#8208;value&#8208;added ammonium acetate, showing great potential for simultaneously achieving nitrate removal, energy conversion, and chemical synthesis. This work can not only provide a guidance for interfacial H2O regulation in extensive hydrogenation reactions but also inspire the design of a novel hybrid flow battery with multiple functions.

         <title>Valence Electron: A Descriptor of Spinel Sulfides for Sulfur Reduction Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The valence electron model, serving as an efficient descriptor, reveals the catalytic activity of spinel sulfides by elucidating the opposing roles of metal&#8211;sulfur covalent bonding and lattice sulfur&#8211;lithium ionic bonding. This insight enables the rational design of the highly efficient (FeCo)3(PS)4 catalyst, significantly enhancing lithium&#8211;sulfur battery performance.








Abstract
Catalysts are essential for achieving high&#8208;performance lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries. The precise design and regulation of catalytic sites to strengthen their efficiency and robustness remains challenging. In this study, spinel sulfides and catalyst design principles through element doping are investigated. This research highlights the distinct role of lattice sulfur sites in lithium polysulfide conversion and emphasizes the differences in catalytic activity between metal and anion sites. The valence electron model as a descriptor can characterize catalytic performance, guiding the design of a (FeCo)3(PS)4 catalyst co&#8208;doped with cation and anion. The (FeCo)3(PS)4 exhibits the highest catalytic performance among spinel catalysts to data, particularly under high sulfur loading conditions. It achieves an initial specific capacity of 1205.9 mAh g&#8722;1 (6.1 mAh cm&#8722;2) at a sulfur loading of 5&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and 1192.7 mAh g&#8722;1 (11.9 mAh cm&#8722;2) at 10&#160;mg cm&#8722;2, demonstrating excellent electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Fe/Mo&#8208;Based Lipid Peroxidation Nanoamplifier Combined with Adenosine Immunometabolism Regulation to Augment Anti&#8208;Breast Cancer Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Fe/Mo&#8208;based LPO nanoamplifier (FMO@P NPs) realizes LPO amplification through GSH depletion and ROS burst for ICD evocation, which combines with immunometabolic checkpoint A2AR blockage for enhancing ICD&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by relieving ADO&#8208;related immunosuppression. This novel joint strategy completely ablates the primary tumor and inhibits the metastasis and recurrence of breast cancer.








Abstract
Immunogenic cell death (ICD)&#8208;mediated immunization strategies have great potential against breast cancer. However, traditional strategies neglect the increase in the immunosuppressive metabolite, adenosine (ADO), during ICD, leading to insufficient therapeutic outcomes. In this study, it is found that the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR) is significantly expressed in breast cancer and positively associated with regulatory T (Treg) cells. Herein, a strategy combining Fe/Mo&#8208;based lipid peroxidation (LPO) nanoamplifiers and A2AR blockade is reported to maximize ICD&#8208;mediated anti&#8208;tumor immunity. This LPO nanoamplifier causes LPO explosion by the Fe (II)&#8208;mediated Fenton reaction and Mo(V)&#8208;mediated Russell mechanism. Subsequently, it elicits the ICD magnification of tumor cells by inducing multiple regulated cell death patterns of ferroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis. Additionally, the A2AR antagonist (SCH58261), an immunometabolic checkpoint blocker, is found to relieve ADO&#8208;related immunosuppression, amplify anti&#8208;tumor immunological effects, and elicit immune memory responses. This robust anti&#8208;tumor immunity is observed in primary, distant, pulmonary metastatic, and recurrent tumors. This study provides a novel strategy for optimizing ICD&#8208;mediated immunotherapy and highlights the benefits of combining LPO explosion with A2AR blockade to enhance breast cancer immunotherapy.

         <title>Colloid&#8208;Forming Prodrug&#8208;Hydrogel Composite Prolongs Lower Intraocular Pressure in Rodent Eyes after Subconjunctival Injection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Colloidal drug aggregates (CDAs) are repurposed as a platform for long&#8208;acting ocular drug delivery. Timolol palmitate CDAs are stabilized within an in situ gelling hydrogel and injected subconjunctivally, reducing intraocular pressure (IOP)&#160;for 49 d with lower systemic exposure compared to conventional eye drops. This approach transforms CDAs into a promising tool for sustained, localized drug delivery.








Abstract
Colloidal drug aggregates (CDAs) are challenging in drug discovery due to their unpredictable formation and interference with screening assays. These limitations are turned into a strategic advantage by leveraging CDAs as a drug delivery platform. This study explores the deliberate formation and stabilization of CDAs for local ocular drug delivery, using a modified smallmolecule glaucoma drug. A series of timolol prodrugs are synthesized and self&#8208;assembled into CDAs. Of four prodrugs, timolol palmitate CDAs have a critical aggregate concentration of 2.72&#160;&#181;M and sustained in vitro release over 28 d. Timolol palmitate CDAs are dispersed throughout in situ gelling hyaluronan&#8208;oxime hydrogel and injected into the subconjunctival space of rat eyes. The intraocular pressure is significantly reduced for at least 49 d with a single subconjunctival injection of timolol&#8208;palmitate CDAs compared to 6&#160;h for conventional timolol maleate. The systemic blood concentrations of timolol are significantly lower, even after 6&#160;h, for timolol palmitate CDA&#8208;loaded hydrogel versus free timolol maleate, thereby potentially reducing the risk of systemic side effects. This innovative approach redefines the role of CDAs and provides a framework for long&#8208;acting ocular therapeutics, shifting their perception from a drug screening challenge to a powerful tool for sustained local drug delivery.

         <title>Polyproline&#8208;Polyornithine Diblock Copolymers with Inherent Mitochondria Tropism</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis and characterization of polypeptide&#8208;based diblock copolymers with inherent mitochondria&#8208;targeting properties. Utilizing a scalable 2&#8208;step polymerization method, these polymers exhibit energy&#8208;independent cellular uptake and cardiolipin&#8208;specific mitochondrial targeting. Their anti&#8208;tumorigenic activity, biocompatibility, and selective mitochondrial accumulation underscore their potential as versatile platforms for targeted subcellular drug delivery and precision mitochondrial nanomedicine applications.









Abstract
Mitochondria play critical roles in regulating cell fate, with dysfunction correlating with the development of multiple diseases, emphasizing the need for engineered nanomedicines that cross biological barriers. Said nanomedicines often target fluctuating mitochondrial properties and/or present inefficient/insufficient cytosolic delivery (resulting in poor overall activity), while many require complex synthetic procedures involving targeting residues (hindering clinical translation). The synthesis/characterization of polypeptide&#8208;based cell penetrating diblock copolymers of poly&#8208;L&#8208;ornithine (PLO) and polyproline (PLP) (PLOn&#8208;PLPm, n:m ratio 1:3) are described as mitochondria&#8208;targeting nanocarriers. Synthesis involves a simple two&#8208;step methodology based on N&#8208;carboxyanhydride ring&#8208;opening polymerization, with the scale&#8208;up optimization using a &#8220;design of experiments&#8221; approach. The molecular mechanisms behind targetability and therapeutic activity are investigated through physical/biological processes for diblock copolymers themselves or as targeting moieties in a poly&#8208;L&#8208;glutamic (PGA)&#8208;based conjugate. Diblock copolymers prompt rapid cell entry via energy&#8208;independent mechanisms and recognize mitochondria through the mitochondria&#8208;specific phospholipid cardiolipin (CL). Stimuli&#8208;driven conditions and mitochondria polarization dynamics, which decrease efficacy depending on disease type/stage, do not compromise diblock copolymer uptake/targetability. Diblock copolymers exhibit inherent concentration&#8208;dependent anti&#8208;tumorigenic activity at the mitochondrial level. The diblock copolymer conjugate possesses improved safety, significant cell penetration, and mitochondrial accumulation via cardiolipin recognition. These findings may support the development of efficient and safe mitochondrial&#8208;targeting nanomedicines.

         <title>Intrinsic Anti&#8208;Freezing, Tough, and Transparent Hydrogels for Smart Optical and Multi&#8208;Modal Sensing Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing and transparent hydrogel with good mechanical properties is prepared through the construction of microphase&#8208;separated nanochannels. In addition, the hydrogel can be used as intelligent optical waveguides and flexible sensors, demonstrating great potential in low&#8208;temperature electronic and optical applications.








Abstract
Hydrogels have received great attention due to their molecular designability and wide application range. However, they are prone to freeze at low temperatures due to the existence of mass water molecules, which can damage their flexibility and transparency, greatly limiting their use in cold environments. Although adding cryoprotectants can reduce the freezing point of hydrogels, it may also deteriorate the mechanical properties and face the risk of cryoprotectant leakage. Herein, the microphase&#8208;separated structures of hydrogels are regulated to confine water molecules in sub&#8208;6&#160;nm nanochannels and increase the proportion of bound water, endowing the hydrogels with intrinsic anti&#8208;freezing properties, high mechanical strength, good stretchability, remarkable fracture energy, and puncture resistance. Even after being kept in liquid nitrogen for 1000&#160;h, the hydrogel still maintains good transparency. The hydrogel can exhibit excellent low&#8208;temperature shape memory and intelligent optical waveguide properties. Additionally, the hydrogel can be assembled into strain and pressure sensors for flexible sensing at both room and low temperatures. The intrinsically anti&#8208;freezing microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel offers broad prospects in low&#8208;temperature electronic and optical applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Screening and General Synthesis Strategy of Single&#8208;Atom Nanozymes for Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work realizes the active drug screening of metal&#8208;SAzymes (AOC&#8208;M SAzymes) in anti&#8208;Oral squamous cell carcinoma application by a combination of high&#8208;throughput DFT calculation and experimental validation. AOC&#8208;Co SAzyme is found to effectively inhibit tumor growth by generating ROS at the tumor site. This work greatly facilitates the rational design of SAzymes for various tumor treatment applications.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom nanozymes (SAzymes), with their superior enzyme&#8208;like catalytic activity, have emerged as promising candidates for oncology therapeutics. The well&#8208;defined structures of SAzymes make them well predictable by experiences and theoretical calculation. However, the effects of metal center species and coordination environments on enzyme&#8208;like activity are variable, and screening catalytic activity by artificial experiments is challenging. High&#8208;throughput screening can rapidly select the activity center structures of SAzymes with optimal enzyme&#8208;like activity, thus their better application in tumor therapy is highly desirable. Herein, a &#8220;high&#8208;throughput screening&#8208;SAzymes structures&#8221; system is established for efficient oncology drug preparation by density functional theory for oxidase&#8208;like processes and screened the differences brought about by different metals and coordination environments. Through this screening process, SAzymes with transition metals (Mn, Fe, Co, Ni) as active centers are synthesized and then tested the multi&#8208;enzyme activities. It is found that the SAzyme with Co as the active metal center exhibited the best oxidase&#8208;like activity, and the system further showed good anti&#8208;oral squamous cell carcinoma properties both in vitro and in vivo. This study opens up a new avenue for the rational design of SAzymes in oral cancer therapy by combining computational screening and experimental validation.

         <title>Dual&#8208;Phase Ligand Engineering Enables 18.21% FAPbI3 Quantum Dot Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 8, February 25, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by incorporating dual&#8208;site ligands, first a dual&#8208;phase ligand exchange strategy is reported by integrating both solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state ligand exchange to synergistically regulate the surface chemistry and passivate defects of Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) quantum dots, ultimately, a record&#8208;high efficiency of 18.21% is obtained for FAPbI3 quantum dot solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead triiodide (FAPbI3) perovskite quantum dot (PQD) are promising candidate for high&#8208;performing quantum dot photovoltaic due to its narrow bandgap, high ambient stability, and long carrier lifetime. However, the carrier transport blockage and nonradiative recombination loss, originating from the high&#8208;dielectric ligands and defects/trap states on the FAPbI3 PQD surface, significantly limit the efficiency and stability of its photovoltaic performance. In this work, through exploring dual&#8208;site molecular ligands, namely 2&#8208;thiophenemethylammonium iodide (2&#8208;TM) and 2&#8208;thiopheneethylammonium iodide (2&#8208;TE), a dual&#8208;phase synergistic ligand exchange (DSLE) protocol consisting of both solution&#8208;phase and solid&#8208;state ligand engineering is demonstrated. The DSLE strategy effectively replaces the native long insulating ligands and simultaneously passivate surface defects in hybrid FAPbI3 PQDs, leading to enhanced electronic coupling for efficient charge transport. Consequently, the FAPbI3 PQD solar cell based on DSLE strategy achieves a notable enhanced efficiency from 15.43% to 17.79% (2&#8208;TM) and 18.21% (2&#8208;TE), respectively. Besides, both 2&#8208;TM and 2&#8208;TE engineered devices exhibit enhanced stability, maintaining over 80% of its initial efficiency after aging in ambient environment (20&#8211;30% humidity, 25 &#176;C) for over 1400 h. It believes these findings will provide a new protocol to precisely regulate the surface chemistry of hybrid PQDs toward high&#8208;performance optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Pioneering the Future: Principles, Advances, and Challenges in Organic Electrodes for Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Leveraging the numerous advantages of ammonium&#8208;ion (NH&#8324;&#8314;)&#8212;including cost&#8208;effectiveness, low corrosiveness, preferential orientation, and rapid diffusion kinetics&#8212;aqueous NH&#8324;&#8314; batteries (AAIBs) have gained significant attention. This review highlights and evaluates the progress of AAIBs utilizing organic electrode materials such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks, and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrid materials, with the goal of advancing cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.








Abstract
Aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion (NH4+) batteries (AAIBs) have recently been considered as attractive alternatives for next&#8208;generation large&#8208;scale energy storage systems, on account of their cost&#8208;effectiveness, nonflammability, less corrosive, small hydrated ionic radius, and rapid NH4+ diffusion kinetics. In addition, the tetrahedral structure of NH4+ exhibits preferential orientation characteristics, resulting in a different electrochemical storage mechanism from spherical charge carriers such as Li+, Na+, and K+. Therefore, unlocking the NH4+&#8208;ion storage mechanisms in host electrode materials is pivotal to advancing the design of high&#8208;performance AAIBs. Organic materials, with their customizable, flexible, and stable molecular structures, along with their ease of recycling and disposal, offer tremendous potential. However, the development of cutting&#8208;edge organic electrode materials specifically for ammonium&#8208;ion storage in AAIBs remains an exciting, yet largely untapped, frontier. This review systematically explores the interaction mechanisms between NH4+ ions and organic electrode materials, such as electrostatic interactions including hydrogen bonding. It also highlights the application of diverse organic electrode materials, such as small molecules, conducting polymers, covalent organic frameworks (COFs), and organic&#8208;inorganic hybrids in AAIBs. Lastly, the review addresses the key challenges and future perspectives of organic&#8208;material&#8208;based AAIBs, aiming to push the boundaries of cutting&#8208;edge aqueous energy storage systems.

         <title>Molecular Weight Engineering Modulates Lignin&#8208;Metal Supramolecular Framework to Construct Carbon&#8208;Coated CoRu Alloy for Effective Overall Water Splitting</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts are synthesized via a Lignin&#8208;Metal supramolecular framework by molecular weight engineering. Lignin with low molecular weight formed graphitic carbon layers with high defect density, resulting in excellent activity but limited stability. While lignin with high molecular weight produced amorphous carbon layers that enhanced durability. In&#8208;situ Raman and DFT indicate that defect density controls electron transport and intermediate adsorption.








Abstract
To overcome the challenges of low catalytic activity and instability, a molecular weight engineering strategy coupled with oxidative ammonolysis is developed to synthesize CoRu&#8208;based alloy catalysts with distinct morphologies and properties from biorefinery lignin. This approach effectively modulates intrinsic active sites and exposes unsaturated nitrogen&#8208;oxygen structures, thereby tailoring the morphology and defect structure of the carbon layers in the catalysts. The as&#8208;synthesized CoRu alloy catalysts from lignin precursors with varying molecular weights are designated as CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOH, and CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual. CoRu@OALC&#8208;EtOAC, featuring a defect&#8208;rich graphitic carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, exhibited exceptional overall water&#8208;splitting performance (1.48 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), significantly surpassing Pt/C || Ru/C (1.58 V at 10 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In contrast, CoRu@OALC&#8208;Residual, with its amorphous carbon&#8208;coated CoRu alloy structure, demonstrated remarkable stability (350 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2), vastly outperforming Pt/C || Ru/C (6 h at 100 mA&#160;cm&#8722;2). In&#8208;situ Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that the defect&#8208;rich carbon layers effectively adsorb *H intermediates, accelerating the catalytic process. This strong adsorption also induces carbon layer rearrangement, leading to its dissolution of the carbon layer and oxidation of CoRu metal particles. This strategy provides a universal method for biomass&#8208;derived catalysts, establishing a direct relationship between molecular weight, catalyst morphology, and electrocatalytic performance.

         <title>Iodine&#8208;Doped Sodium Vanadate Cathode for Improved Zn Ion Diffusion Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An iodine&#8208;doping strategy is developed to modify the Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode for aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries, effectively reducing the electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure. This modification enables faster diffusion and higher storage capacity of zinc ions.








Abstract
The electrostatic interaction between zinc ions and the host structure significantly limits the practicality of vanadium&#8208;based cathodes in aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries (AZIBs). Herein, an anion doping strategy is demonstrated to mitigate electrostatic resistance and steric hindrance during zinc ion insertion by incorporating iodine atoms into the lattice of the cathode material, Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O. Iodine doping reduces the adsorption energy at the most stable site, thereby weakening the Zn2+&#8208;host interaction and lowering the Zn2+ diffusion energy barrier, resulting in a one&#8208;order&#8208;of&#8208;magnitude increase in the diffusion coefficient. Moreover, the large atomic size of iodine expands the host lattice, creating ample space for increased zinc ion storage capacity, further supported by the introduced oxygen vacancies. As a result, the iodine&#8208;doped Na2V6O16&#183;3H2O cathode achieves an impressive specific capacity of 528.8&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 at a current density of 0.5&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1, and retains 262&#160;mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 after 12,000 cycles at a high current rate of 10&#160;A&#160;g&#8722;1. This work provides new insights into the design of high&#8208;performance cathode materials for AZIBs.

         <title>Biomimetic Design of Breathable 2D Photothermal Fabric with Three&#8208;Layered Structure for Efficient Four&#8208;Plane Evaporation of Seawater</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by leaf structure and the transpiration process, a breathable 2D photothermal fabric with a three&#8208;layer structure for efficient four&#8208;plane evaporation of seawater is developed. The fabric evaporator achieves faster evaporation rates (2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2), outperforming single&#8208;plane (1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) and double&#8208;plane (1.9 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1) evaporations.








Abstract
2D photothermal membranes have demonstrated numerous advantages in solar desalination due to their flexibility, scalability, and low cost. However, their practical applications are limited by the restricted evaporation area and obstructed vapor channels. A biomimetic design of the breathable 2D photothermal fabric is reported, which is composed of two carbon&#8208;nanotube&#8208;hydrogel&#8208;coated polyester (PET) fabrics separated by fiber pillars, with the upper fabric layer having a hole array as stomatal channels. This fabric shows high solar&#8208;absorption efficiency (96.1%) and decreased water&#8208;evaporation enthalpy (1664.6 kJ kg&#8722;1). The hanging fabric as a heliotropic evaporator exhibits four&#8208;plane evaporation feature and achieves a high evaporation rate of 2.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 under sunlight (1.0 kW m&#8722;2) illumination, better than the traditional floated model (single&#8208;plane, 1.6 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1). The evaporation rate can be further enhanced to 4.2 kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 upon introducing adscititious airflow (2 m s&#8722;1). Simultaneously, the heliotropic&#8208;hanging design allows the dropping of concentrated brine, avoiding solid&#8208;salt&#8208;crystallization.

         <title>Living Fiber Dispersions from Mycelium as a New Sustainable Platform for Advanced Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium and their extracellular materials are prepared by a facile three&#8208;roll milling process. These dispersions can be easily converted into a wide array of multifunctional living materials. These living materials display increased emulsion stability, enhanced mechanical properties, superhydrophobicity, and instantaneous proximity sensing as a result of fungal growth.








Abstract
Functional biopolymeric fibers are key building blocks for developing sustainable materials within the growing bioeconomy. However, their flexible use in emerging advanced materials with smart properties typically requires processing methods that may compromise sustainability. Here, a sustainable route to generate living fiber dispersions (LFD) from mycelium that combines the excellent material&#8208;forming properties of biopolymeric fibers, and the highly dynamic properties of living materials is proposed. This is showcased by using industrially available liquid culture and mechanical defibrillation methods to generate well&#8208;dispersed living mycelium fibers. These fibers can form materials where precursors with good dispersibility and network formation properties are paramount and can harness dynamic properties through growth even in the absence of added nutrients. This is demonstrated in unique living emulsions with 3.6x slower phase separation and in living films with 2.5x higher tensile strength upon growth, the latter vastly outperforming the strongest pure mycelium materials to date. Further, humidity can be used to modulate mechanical properties and to trigger the superhydrophobic patterning of substrates, mechanical actuation, and degradation of lignocellulosic consumer goods at their end of life. In the future, combining synthetic biology with this promising platform for smart materials can expand the horizons for sustainable material manufacturing.

         <title>Targeted High&#8208;Resolution 3D Imaging of Tumor Vasculatures at Different Stages Using Far&#8208;Red AIE Nanoparticles Compatible with Tissue Clearing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents an imaging technology for precise mapping and analysis of lung tumor vasculature at different stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue optical clearing (TOC). The advanced imaging technique reveals significant insights into tumor vascular dynamics, offering valuable implications for cancer diagnosis and therapy.








Abstract
The occurrence and progression of blood vessels plays a pivotal role in different stages of tumor development, while current imaging techniques exhibit limited sensitivity to capture the dynamic changes of vasculature at different tumor stages. This drawback hinders the comprehensive understanding of the tumor microenvironment, thereby impeding the development of efficacious therapeutic strategies. Herein, a high&#8208;resolution three&#8208;dimensional (3D) imaging technology is developed for mapping and analyzing vasculatures at different tumor stages using HA@TANP, a supramolecular assembly of far&#8208;red fluorescence nanoparticles with aggregation&#8208;induced emission (AIE), compatible with tissue clearing. The hyaluronic acid (HA) in HA@TANP specifically targets CD44 antigen of tumor vasculature, while the acrylic acid in HA@TANP is applied for temperature&#8208;induced polymerization to ensure the covalent attachment of AIE fluorophores. Additionally, tissue optical clearing technology boosts light penetration and imaging resolution in dense tumor tissues. This strategy allows for the quantitative analyses of vascular diameter, length, and straightness and their correlation with various responses to treatments. The findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of distinct tumor vascular stages, providing valuable insights for enhanced cancer diagnosis and therapies from a tumor vascular&#8208;targeted perspective.

         <title>In&#8208;Sensor Computing with Visual&#8208;Tactile Perception Enabled by Mechano&#8208;Optical Artificial Synapse</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechano&#8208;optical artificial synapse that enables in&#8208;sensor computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception is achieved by integrating photostimulated luminescence with self&#8208;recoverable mechanoluminescence materials. The multimodal artificial synapse demonstrates an individual and synergistic plasticity in a remotely accessible manner and enables neuromorphic pattern recognition and materials identification. This work paves the way to construct flexible in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.








Abstract
In&#8208;sensor computing paradigm holds the promise of realizing rapid and low&#8208;power signal processing. Constructing crossmodal in&#8208;sensor computing systems to emulate human sensory and recognition capabilities has been a persistent pursuit for developing humanoid robotics. Here, an artificial mechano&#8208;optical synapse is reported to implement in&#8208;sensor dynamic computing with visual&#8208;tactile perception. By employing mechanoluminescence (ML) material, direct conversion of the mechanical signals into light emission is achieved and the light is transported to an adjacent photostimulated luminescence (PSL) layer without pre&#8208; and post&#8208;irradiation. The PSL layer acts as a photon reservoir as well as a processing unit for achieving in&#8208;memory computing. The approach based on ML coupled with PSL material is different from traditional circuit&#8211;constrained methods, enabling remote operation and easy accessibility. Individual and synergistic plasticity are elaborately investigated under force and light pulses, including paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, learning behavior, and short&#8208;term and long&#8208;term memory. A multisensory neural network is built for processing the obtained handwritten patterns with a tablet consisting of the device, achieving a recognition accuracy of up to 92.5%. Moreover, material identification has been explored based on visual&#8208;tactile sensing, with an accuracy rate of 98.6%. This work provides a promising strategy to construct in&#8208;sensor computing systems with crossmodal integration and recognition.

         <title>Eliminating Radioresistance With a Magnetic Ion&#8208;Generator by Simultaneously Augmenting DNA Damage and Diminishing Immunosuppression</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional medicine has encountered certain bottlenecks in dealing with radioresistance. To address this, a &#8220;three birds with one stone&#8221; strategy based on the constructed radioresistance model is developed. This innovative magnetic ion&#8208;generator can not only release Fe2+ and Mn2+ ions to induce ferroptosis and activate the STING pathway, enhancing DNA damage synergistically with radiotherapy, but it can also modulate the immunosuppressive microenvironment effectively, thereby reversing radioresistance.








Abstract
Radiotherapy (RT) hinges on DNA damage&#8208;induced cancer cell death and the subsequent anti&#8208;tumor immunity. However, the efficacy of RT is curtailed by cell cycle heterogeneity and an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, which foster radioresistance. Here an ion generator&#8208;based RT enhancement strategy is demonstrated in a mouse model of the radioresistant tumor. The ion generator is degraded in the tumor microenvironment, resulting in iron&#8208;triggered ferroptosis that enhanced immunogenic cell death and a manganese&#8208;activated stimulator of interferon gene that reversed the immunosuppressive environment. As a result, the proposed strategy promotes dendritic cells maturity, augmentes CD8+ T cell infiltration of tumors, suppresses intratumoral myeloid&#8208;derived suppressor cells, and limits the M2 macrophages polarization, indicating the formation of an immunoreactive microenvironment. Significantly, this approach impedes the growth of not just primary, but also distal metastatic tumors. It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.

It is thus believed that the current ion generator provides a robust and enduring countermeasure to radioresistant cancer and its metastasis, with potential implications for enhancing the efficacy of RT in clinically resistant tumors.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Quantum Geometric Moment Encodes Stacking Order of Moir&#233; Matter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Berry curvature dipole (BCD) changes across valley Chern transitions. A new electrical technique is developed to use such BCD sign flips for distinguishing the stacking order of a moir&#233; material, namely twisted double bilayer graphene. Such a method, analogous to spectroscopic techniques, establishes a link between quantum geometry and stacking order, and is applicable to other moir&#233; materials.








Abstract
Exploring the topological characteristics of electronic bands is essential in condensed matter physics. Moir&#233; materials featuring flat bands provide a versatile platform for engineering band topology and correlation effects. In moir&#233; materials that break either time&#8208;reversal symmetry or inversion symmetry or both, electronic bands exhibit Berry curvature hotspots. Different stacking orders in these materials result in varied Berry curvature distributions within the flat bands, even when the band dispersion remains similar. However, experimental studies probing the impact of stacking order on the quantum geometric quantities are lacking. 1.4&#176; twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) facilitates two distinct stacking orders (AB&#8208;AB, AB&#8208;BA) and forms an inversion broken moir&#233; superlattice with electrically tunable flat bands. The valley Chern numbers of the flat bands depend on the stacking order, and the nonlinear Hall (NLH) effect distinguishes the differences in Berry curvature dipole (BCD), the first moment of Berry curvature. The BCD exhibits antisymmetric behavior, flipping its sign with the polarity of the perpendicular electric field in AB&#8208;AB TDBG, while it displays a symmetric behavior, maintaining the same sign regardless of the electric field's polarity in AB&#8208;BA TDBG. This approach electronically detects stacking&#8208;induced quantum geometry, while opening a pathway to quantum geometry engineering and&#160;detection.

         <title>Monomolecule Coupled to Oxygen&#8208;Doped Carbon for Efficient Electrocatalytic Hydrogen Peroxide Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cobalt phthalocyanine molecule&#8208;modified oxygen&#8208;doped carbon catalyst achieves superior oxygen reduction with two&#8208;electron selectivity of 99% and hydrogen peroxide yield of 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1. The modulation of the electronic structure of active sites through &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking&#8208;mediated oxygen doping optimizes the interaction between active sites and intermediate *OOH.








Abstract
The electrocatalytic production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an ideal alternative for the industrial anthraquinone process because of environmental friendliness and energy efficiency, depending on the activity and selectivity of catalysts. Carbon&#8208;based materials possess prospects as candidate catalysts for the production of H2O2. Herein, cedar&#8208;derived monolithic carbon catalysts modified with coupling oxygen doping and phthalocyanine molecules are synthesized. Cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc)&#160;molecules are introduced onto the carbon surface to construct monomolecular active sites via &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. The electronic structure of CoPc is modulated by oxygen doping on carbon substrates, mediated by monomolecular &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking. A synergistic effect optimally modulated the interaction between CoPc and key intermediate to H2O2. The energy barrier for oxygen reduction is reduced to optimize the selectivity to H2O2. CoPc@OCW provided up to 99% selectivity to H2O2 at 0.7&#160;V versus RHE. In a three&#8208;phase flow cell, CoPc@OCW achieved an H2O2 yield up to 10.4 mol&#183;g&#8722;1&#183;h&#8722;1 at 0.2&#160;V versus RHE with stable running for 24 h. The advantages of carbon&#8208;based catalysts including the adjustable chemical structure depending on &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking and electronic structure of carbon atoms through oxygen doping improved the catalytic performances in the production of H2O2. This proof&#8208;to&#8208;concept research demonstrates the potential application of carbon&#8208;based molecular catalysts for electrochemical synthesis.

         <title>Organomolecular Ferroelectric Nanocatalyst Augments Tumor Immunotherapy by Inducing Apoptosis and Ferroptosis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports on the engineering of a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform to facilitate effective ferroelectric nanocatalyst catalysis for augmented tumor immunotherapy through inducing apoptosis and ferroptosis.








Abstract
Immunogenic programmed cell death effectively triggers acute inflammatory responses, thereby enhancing antitumor immunity. The advancement of biodegradable nonmetallic dual inducers represents a promising strategy. Herein, a biodegradable organomolecular ferroelectric nanoplatform (C60&#8208;TCNQ, CT) is designed to facilitate effective ferroelectric catalysis, thereby augmenting tumor immunotherapy through apoptosis and ferroptosis. CT&#8208;mediated ultrasound&#8208;triggered ferroelectric catalysis promotes ferroelectric polarization and significantly increases the production of reactive oxygen species, leading to substantial tumor cell apoptosis. Moreover, the polycyano group of CT nanoparticles selectively reacts with cysteine under mild conditions, resulting in redox imbalances and the accumulation of lipid peroxides, which contribute to the induction of ferroptosis in tumor cells. Additionally, the apoptosis and ferroptosis induced by CT stimulate immunogenic cell death progression, eliciting robust immune responses. In vivo evaluation using a bilateral tumor model demonstrates the capacity of CT to sensitize anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 therapy under ultrasound irradiation, achieving an impressive antitumor response rate of 96.2% against malignant melanoma and an 80% inhibition of tumor metastasis. RNA sequencing analysis revealed that treatment with CT resulted in a downregulation of gene signatures associated with the immune&#8208;related Jak&#8208;Stat signaling pathway. This study opens a novel avenue to developing organomolecular ferroelectric nanomedicines for effective tumor immunotherapy.

         <title>Leveraging Strong Electric Field Gradients at Anapole Resonances for Enhanced Second Harmonic Generation from Molybdenum Disulfide Disks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks supporting combined anapole scattering and Fabry&#8208;Perot resonances with not just strong electric field enhancement but also enhanced field gradients for application in resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) are designed, fabricated, and experimentally studied. Some of the highest enhancement numbers reported for the case of the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype of MoS2 are reported.








Abstract
Van der Waals layered materials are emerging as promising nanophotonic platforms for realizing linear and nonlinear optical devices. In particular, the high refractive indices of transition metal dichalcogenides, combined with their strong layer dependent optical properties offer interesting possibilities for designing photonic functionalities. In this study, the resonant enhancement of second harmonic generation (SHG) using molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) disks on a silicon substrate with an intermediate silicon dioxide (SiO2) layer is demonstrated. The resonant enhancement observed here is attributed to the combined interaction of the anapole scattering modes supported within the disk and Fabry&#8208;Perot (FP) modes within the multilayer stack. For a fixed MoS2 disk dimensions, an optimized SiO2 layer thickness results in constructive interference between the anapole and FP modes, thereby enhancing the fundamental field within the disk. Utilizing this resonance mechanism, SHG enhancements as high as 160 and 85&#8208;times are experimentally demonstrated when compared with unpatterned multilayer and monolayer MoS2 flakes respectively. These are the highest reported enhancement values for the widely used 2H&#8208;polytype MoS2. A significant enhancement in SHG is observed here for 2H&#8208;MoS2 despite the alternating sheet dipoles canceling the far&#8208;field emission owing to the strong electric field gradient setup within the disk at the anapole resonance.

Using nanocellulose as a building block, P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon are constructed by in situ polymerization and hydrothermal treatment combined with phosphorylation. When being used for modifying the commercial separator of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries, the composite provides abundant catalytic active sites and rapid ion accessibility. The assembled cell achieves an initial specific capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at a sulfur loading of 8.1 mg cm&#8722;2 under lean electrolyte conditions.








Abstract
The integration of nanocatalysts into the separators of lithium&#8211;sulfur batteries (LSBs) boosts the polysulfide conversion efficiency. However, the aggregation of catalyst nanoparticles diminishes the active surface area. Moreover, densely packed catalyst&#8208;modified layers often hinder ion transport rates and impede access to the catalytic sites. To overcome these challenges, a strategy is reported for modifying commercial separators, using wood nanocellulose as a building block to construct hierarchical P&#8208;doped MoO2&#8722;x nanoparticles anchored on N, P co&#8208;doped porous carbon (P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC). The web&#8208;like entangled nanocellulose forms a framework for the in situ polymerization of polyaniline, providing abundant anchoring sites for MoO2 nanoparticles. The addition of P atoms optimizes the d&#8208;band center of MoO2 and enhances the catalytic activity of polysulfide conversion. The LSBs assembled using a P&#8208;MoO2&#8722;x/NPC coated polypropylene separator display an initial discharge capacity of 1621 mAh g&#8722;1 and rate performance of 774 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 C. Even with a sulfur loading of 8.1&#160;mg cm&#8722;2 and lean electrolyte conditions, the cell achieves an initial areal capacity of 11.3 mAh cm&#8722;2 at 0.1 C. This work provides a biopolymer nanofiber solution for constructing LSB separators with advanced electrochemical reactivity.

         <title>Inverse Oxide/Alloy&#8208;Structured Nanozymes with NIR&#8208;Triggered Enzymatic Cascade Regulation of ROS Homeostasis for Efficient Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme, Co7Fe3/ZnO@C, is developed to achieve near&#8208;infrared light&#8208;triggered enzymatic cascade regulation. Under near&#8208;infrared (NIR) irradiation, hot electrons are transferred from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, activating synchronized superoxide dismutase&#8208;like, catalase&#8208;like, peroxidase&#8208;like, and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity&#8208;like enzymatic activities. These cascaded activities enable spatiotemporal modulation of reactive oxygen species dynamics, synergistically integrating chemodynamic therapy, photodynamic therapy, and photothermal therapy to accelerate infected wound healing.








Abstract
The precise spatiotemporal control of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation and scavenging remains pivotal for infected wound healing. However, conventional nanozymes fail to adaptively regulate ROS dynamics across inflammatory and proliferative phases. A near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;activated inverse oxide/alloy&#8208;structured nanozyme (Co7Fe3/ZnO@C) is developed, featuring enzymatic cascade activities to tune ROS homeostasis through synergistic chemodynamic (CDT), photodynamic (PDT), and photothermal (PTT) therapies. The nanozyme orchestrates a self&#8208;regulated cascade: peroxidase (POD)&#8208;like activity initially generates bactericidal hydroxyl radicals in acidic wounds, while subsequent NIR triggers hot electron transfer from Co7Fe3 to ZnO, facilitating synchronized superoxide dismutase (SOD)&#8208;like, catalase (CAT)&#8208;like and hydroxyl radical antioxidant capacity (HORAC) activities to scavenge residual ROS. This cascaded network dynamically balances ROS production (POD) and scavenging (NIR&#8208;driven SOD/CAT/HORAC), eradicating bacteria while resolving inflammation. In vitro/vivo studies have shown that the proposed method for maintaining ROS homeostasis can markedly enhance the rate of wound healing by the regulation of the inflammatory environment within the injured tissue and the facilitation of rapid re&#8208;epithelialization. This work provides an intelligent nanozyme platform that simulates the function of natural enzymes and constructs a cascade reaction strategy to balance the antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory demands in the wound microenvironment.

         <title>Ionic Liquid Induced Static and Dynamic Interface Double Shields for Long&#8208;Lifespan All&#8208;Temperature Zn&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic&#8208;liquid based wide&#8208;temperature electrolyte inducing static and dynamic interface double shields of Zn anodes is developed for achieving highly stable Zn&#8208;ion batteries with an operating temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;40&#8211;60 &#176;C.








Abstract
Aqueous Zn&#8208;ion batteries (ZIBs) have experienced substantial advancements recently, while the aqueous electrolytes exhibit limited thermal adaptability. The low&#8208;cost Zn(BF4)2 salt possesses potential low&#8208;temperature application, while brings unsatisfied stability of Zn anodes. To address this challenge, an ionic liquid based eutectic electrolyte (ILEE) utilizing the Zn(BF4)2 presenting remarkable stability across a temperature range of &#8776;&#8722;100&#8211;150 &#176;C is developed, enabling ZIBs to operate in diverse thermal conditions. The inner Zn2+ solvation structure can be modulated to a BF4&#8722;&#8208;rich state within the ILEE system, forming a static ZnF&#8322; layer at the electrolyte&#8208;Zn anode interface, as evidenced by ab initial molecular dynamic simulations. Moreover, the positively charged EMIM+ can accumulate on the Zn anodes to form the secondary electrostatic dynamic shield that mitigates the uncontrollable Zn dendrites growth, enhancing the overall cycling life of Zn anodes to over 10 times compared with the pure Zn(BF4)2 system. When utilizing the ILEE as the electrolyte, PANI||Zn full cells demonstrate acceptable performances under the all&#8208;temperature environments, especially presenting a long life of over 9500 cycles at a low temperature of &#8722;40 &#176;C and 500 cycles at a high temperature of 60 &#176;C. This special ILEE holds significant promise for future aqueous batteries in extreme environment.

         <title>Amyloid&#8208;Templated Ceria Nanozyme Reinforced Microneedle for Diabetic Wound Treatments</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates an effective strategy for synthesizing high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes, and introduces the first example of amyloid&#8208;ceria nanozymes reinforced microneedle which features a complex, synergistic catalytic behavior combining superoxide dismutase and catalase&#8208;like activities, promoting to remodel the infection microenvironment in diabetic wounds, and holding significant promise for clinical applications.








Abstract
Amyloid fibrils have emerged as excellent templates and building blocks for the development of ordered functional materials with considerable potential in biomedical applications. Here, lysozyme amyloid fibrils (Lys&#8208;AFs) are employed as templates for the in situ synthesis of ceria nanozymes (Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria) with ultrafine dimensions, an optimized Ce3+/Ce4+ ratio, and uniform distribution on the fibril surface, addressing the challenges of low catalytic efficiency and high susceptibility to aggregation typical of traditional methods. As a proof of concept, it is further applied Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria to develop hydrogel/microneedle for treating bacteria&#8208;infected diabetic wounds via non&#8208;covalent interactions between polyphenols and amyloid fibrils incorporating glucose oxidase (GOX). The hydrogel/microneedle facilitates superoxide dismutase and catalase cascade catalysis by Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria, and integrates GOX&#8208;mediated glucose consumption, synergistically achieving glucose reduction, reactive oxygen species elimination, and hypoxia alleviation in the diabetic wound infection microenvironment. In addition to antibacterial properties and tissue regeneration promotion of Lys&#8208;AFs scaffold, Lys&#8208;AFs&#8208;Ceria regulates macrophages polarization toward an anti&#8208;inflammatory M2 state. Collectively, these attributes contribute to the enhanced efficacy of diabetic wound healing, with in vivo studies demonstrating increased healing efficiency following a single application, and more in general an effective strategy toward high&#8208;catalytic and stable nanozymes.

         <title>Cholesterol Cocrystal Ferroelectrics Modulated by Solvent Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A series of ferroelectric cocrystals of cholesterol methanol (CHOL&#8208;MeOH) and cholesterol ethanol (CHOL&#8208;EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect, where the introduction of hydroxyl&#8208;containing solvents like methanol and ethanol can induce ferroelectricity in cholesterol by reducing the O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond length as well as largely decreasing the maximum energy barrier for polarization reversal.








Abstract
Cholesterol (CHOL) is an inherently biodegradable material with multiple chiral centers, being an essential component for cell membranes. Considering the close relationship between chirality and ferroelectric feature, this compound with chiral&#8208;polar structure is an intrinsic polar material. However, the ferroelectricity of CHOL crystals has never been found to date.

&lt;p&gt;A series of ferroelectric cocrystals of cholesterol methanol (CHOL-MeOH) and cholesterol ethanol (CHOL-EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect, where the introduction of hydroxyl-containing solvents like methanol and ethanol can induce ferroelectricity in cholesterol by reducing the O&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;O hydrogen bond length as well as largely decreasing the maximum energy barrier for polarization reversal.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Cholesterol (CHOL) is an inherently biodegradable material with multiple chiral centers, being an essential component for cell membranes. Considering the close relationship between chirality and ferroelectric feature, this compound with chiral-polar structure is an intrinsic polar material. However, the ferroelectricity of CHOL crystals has never been found to date. Herein, a series of ferroelectric cocrystals of CHOL methanol (CHOL-MeOH) and CHOL ethanol (CHOL-EtOH) have been constructed through the solvent effect. It is found that the introduction of some solvent molecules containing hydroxyls such as methanol and ethanol can reduce the acceptor&#183;&#183;&#183;donor length and thus form a 1D electroactive channel and further induce ferroelectricity in CHOL. Based on the density functional theory (DFT) calculation analyses represented by CHOL-EtOH, the largely decreased maximum energy barrier for the polarization reversal of &#8776;50% suggests that the electric polarization of the cocrystal is much easier to be reoriented under the external electric field through the solvent effect.

         <title>Lithiophilic&#8208;Gradient, Li+ Supplementary Interphase Design for Lean Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
High energy/power density batteries have become an urgent need for the electric vehicle and consumer electronics markets. In this work, Cheng et&#160;al. develop an lean lithium metal batteries (LLMB) prototype with lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design and self&#8208;supplementary Li sources for bare Cu foil. It provides a new perspective for the optimization strategy for next generation lithium metal batteries (LMBs).








Abstract
The practicability of anode&#8208;less/free lithiummetal batteries (LMBs) is impeded by unregulated dendrite formation on thedeposition substrate. Herein, this study presents a lithiophilic&#8208;gradient, layer&#8208;stacked interfacial design for the lean lithium metal battery (LLMB) model. Engineered via a facile wet&#8208;chemistry approach, the high entropy metalphosphide (HEMP) particles with tunable lithiophilic species are dispersedwithin reduced graphene oxide (RGO). Moreover, a poly (vinylidene fluoride co&#8208;hexafluoropropylenepolymer) (PVDF&#8208;HFP), blended with molten Li at the tailorable amounts, forms aLi supplementary top layer through a layer&#8208;transfer printing technique. Theintegrated layer (HEMP@RGO&#8208;MTL@PH) not only regulates the dendrite&#8208;free lithiumdeposition towards the Cu substrate up to 10 mAh cm&#8722;2, but also maintains robust cyclability of the symmetric cell at 5 mA cm&#8722;2 even under 83% depth of discharge. As pairing the modified Cu foil with the LiNi0.8Mn0.1Co0.1O2 cathode (NCM811, 16.9 mg cm&#8722;2, double sided, N/P ratio of 0.21) in the 200 mAh pouch cell, achieves gravimetric energy densities of 414.7 Wh kg&#8722;1, power output of 977.1 W kg&#8722;1, as well as highly reversible phasic evolutionmonitored in operando. This gradient interfacial strategy can promotethe commercialization of energy/power&#8208;dense energy storage solutions.

         <title>Hierarchical&#8208;Structured RGO@EGaIn Composites as Advanced Self&#8208;Healing Anode for Room&#8208;Temperature Liquid Metal Battery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
GO naturally adsorbs onto the surface of LMPs via electrostatic interactions, self&#8208;assembles into a core&#8211;shell structure, and subsequently reduces to RGO in an acidic solution. The presence of RGO in the hierarchical structural composites significantly improves the electrode&#8208;electrolyte interface, suppressing and accommodating the irregular deformation of LMPs during the electrochemical reaction process and promoting the formation of a stable SEI film.









Abstract
Gallium&#8208;based liquid metal (LM) has emerged as a promising candidate anode material for lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs), exhibiting high theoretical capacity, excellent electrode kinetics, and unique self&#8208;healing ability. However, the liquid&#8208;solid&#8208;liquid transition during the electrochemical reactions can disrupt the solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) and damage the structural integrity, ultimately limiting the cycling stability. Here, hierarchical&#8208;structured reduced graphene oxide coated eutectic gallium&#8208;indium liquid metal particles (RGO@EGaIn LMPs) are synthesized using a facile self&#8208;assembly strategy. The customized RGO@EGaIn electrode demonstrated impressive performance in both half&#8208;cell and full&#8208;cell configurations for LIBs. The morphological and phase transitions of RGO@EGaIn LMPs during the lithiation/delithiation processes are uncovered by real&#8208;time in situ transmission electron microscopy tests. It is clarified that the presence of RGO in the hierarchical structure buffers the volume expansion of LMPs from &#8776;160% to 125% and provides a fast pathway for the rapid transfer of ions and electrons during the electrochemical reaction, which effectively enhances the electrochemical performance of the electrode. This work introduces a straightforward and effective method for preparing high&#8208;performance room&#8208;temperature liquid metal electrodes, representing a significant step forward toward the commercial application of liquid metal batteries.

         <title>An Electron Transfer Mediated Mechanism for Efficient Photoreforming of Waste Plastics Using a Ni3S4/ZnCdS Heterojunction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is prepared for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. The catalyst exhibits high H2 production rates of 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with selectivities of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from PLA and PET, respectively.








Abstract
The oxidative degradation of plastics in conjunction with the production of clean hydrogen (H2) represents a significant challenge. Herein, a Ni3S4/ZnCdS heterojunction is rationally synthesized and employed for the efficient production of H2 and high&#8208;selectivity value&#8208;added chemicals from waste plastic. By integrating spectroscopic analysis techniques with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, a solely electron transfer&#8208;mediated reaction mechanism is confirmed, wherein Ni3S4 extracts electrons from ZnCdS (ZCS) to promote the spatial segregation of photogenerated electrons and holes, which not only facilitates H2 production but also maintains the high oxidation potential of holes on the ZCS&#160;surface, favoring hole&#8208;dominated plastic oxidation. Notably, the catalyst exhibited efficient H2 production rates as high as 27.9 and 17.4 mmol g&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, along with a selectivity of 94.2% and 78.3% in the liquid product toward pyruvate and acetate production from polylactic acid (PLA) and polyethylene terephthalate (PET), respectively. Additionally, carbon yields of 26.5% for pyruvate and 2.2% for acetate are measured after 9 h of photoreforming, representing the highest values reported to date. Overall, this research presents a promising approach for converting plastic waste into H2 fuel and high&#8208;selectivity valuable chemical products, offering a potential solution to the growing issue of &#8220;White Pollution&#8221;.

         <title>Electrochemical Synthesis of 2D Polymeric Fullerene for Broadband Photodetection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D polymeric C60 is an emerging all&#8208;carbon semiconductor possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. A hydrogen&#8208;assisted electrochemical strategy has been developed to produce gram&#8208;scale large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). The thin&#8208;film photodetectors demonstrate broad spectral response from visible light to near&#8208;infrared region.








Abstract
2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C60 nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time&#8208;consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m2) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C60 with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H+) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra&#8208;n&#8208;butylammonium (TBA+), ensuring gram&#8208;scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C60. As a proof of concept, the solution&#8208;processed 2D polymeric C60 nanosheets have been integrated into thin&#8208;film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C60.

&lt;p&gt;2D polymeric fullerene scaffolds, composed of covalently bonded superatomic C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; nanoclusters, are emerging semiconductors possessing unique hierarchical electronic structures. Hitherto their synthesis has relied on complex and time-consuming reactions, thereby hindering scalable production and limiting the technological relevance. Here, the study demonstrates a facile electrochemical exfoliation strategy based on the intercalation and expansion of a layered fullerene superlattice, to produce large size (&#8776;52.5 &#181;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and monolayer thick 2D polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; with high exfoliation yield (&#8776;83%). In situ reduction of solvated protons (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) weakens the interlayer interactions thereby promoting the rapid and uniform intercalation of tetra-n-butylammonium (TBA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), ensuring gram-scale throughput and high structural integrity of exfoliated 2D polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;. As a proof of concept, the solution-processed 2D polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt; nanosheets have been integrated into thin-film photodetectors, exhibiting a broad spectral photoresponse ranging from 405 to 1200 nm, with a peak photocurrent at 850 nm and a stable response time. This efficient and scalable exfoliation method holds great promise for the advancement of multifunctional composites and optoelectronic devices based on 2D polymeric C&lt;sub&gt;60&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Radical Molecular Network&#8208;Buffer Minimizes Photovoltage Loss in FAPbI&#8323; Perovskite Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An in situ polymerizable radical molecule (ATEMPO) preferentially interacting with the {111}c facets, is employed as an additive to promote perovskite crystal growth. During annealing, ATEMPO polymerizes, forming a network&#8208;buffer that mitigates lattice strain and suppresses intragrain planar defects. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality perovskite films, achieving a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, minimizing photovoltage loss in FAPbI&#8323; perovskite solar cells.








Abstract
Formamidinium lead iodide (FAPbI&#8323;) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) hold immense potential for high&#8208;efficiency photovoltaics, but maximizing their open&#8208;circuit voltage (VOC) remains challenging. Targeting the inherently stable {111}c&#8208;dominant facets is a promising approach for enhancing stability, but their formation typically suffers from high defect densities and disordered growth. This study introduces a novel approach using an in situ polymerizable radical molecule, ATEMPO, as an additive to address these issues. ATEMPO preferentially interacts with the {111}c perovskite facets, guiding their growth and forming a &#8220;radical molecular network&#8208;buffer&#8221; upon polymerization. The network effectively mitigates lattice strain, suppresses defect formation, enhances charge transport via redox&#8208;mediated hopping, and provides a hydrophobic barrier, significantly improving moisture resistance. This strategy yields high&#8208;quality, {111}c &#8208;oriented FAPbI&#8323; films, leading to a champion PCE of 25.28% with a remarkably high VOC of 1.203 V, corresponding to an energy loss (Eloss) of only 0.297 eV, among the highest VOC reported for FAPbI&#8323;&#8208;based PSCs. Furthermore, a mini&#8208;module fabricate with an active area of 12.5 cm2 achieve a high PCE of 21.39%. the work paves the way for developing high&#8208;performance, stable PSCs with minimized photovoltage loss. Furthermore, it offers a promising strategy to enhance device longevity and address environmental concerns.

         <title>Universal Prophylactic Antitumor Vaccination Using Stem Cell Membrane&#8208;Coated Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Induced pluripotent stem cell membrane is coated onto adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle cores to create a universal cancer vaccine. The formulation utilizes oncofetal antigens present on the cell membrane to elicit broadly protective immune responses in vivo. The enhanced immunity generated by the nanovaccine enables robust prophylactic efficacy against multiple murine tumor models.








Abstract
Cancer vaccines are a promising immunotherapeutic modality that function by training the immune system to recognize and destroy malignant cells. As tumor&#8208;specific and tumor&#8208;associated antigens generally cannot be identified until after a tumor has already been established, these vaccines must be applied therapeutically when strong immunosuppressive mechanisms are already in place. Building upon previous work using cell membrane coating nanotechnology, the development of a broad&#8208;spectrum prophylactic cancer nanovaccine that consists of induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) membrane coated around an adjuvant&#8208;loaded nanoparticle core is shown. The resulting nanostructure is capable of presenting iPSC&#8208;derived oncofetal antigens, which are oftentimes re&#8208;expressed on cancer cells but lowly present on normal adult tissues. When administered in vivo, the iPSC membrane&#8208;coated nanoparticles are highly immunostimulatory and elicit strong antitumor immunity that can successfully inhibit the growth of multiple tumor types, including five different murine tumor models and in a bilaterial heterogeneous tumor model. Overall, this work demonstrates an effective approach for engineering iPSC&#8208;based nanovaccines that can be applied broadly to prevent cancer before it occurs.

         <title>Single&#8208;Atom Enables Reverse Hydrogen Spillover for High&#8208;Performance Protonic Ceramic Fuel Cells</title>

         <dc:description>
A novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, develope via a scalable solid&#8208;state approach, forms a distinctive 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8211;O&#8211;Fe configuration that induces reverse hydrogen spillover and promotes proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction. The optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode based fuel cell delivers an excellent peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C with stable operation for 200 h.









Abstract
Protonic ceramic fuel cells (PCFCs) offer a promising avenue for sustainable energy conversion, however, their commercial potential is hindered by sluggish proton&#8208;involved oxygen reduction reaction (P&#8208;ORR) kinetics and inadequate durability of cathode materials. Here, a novel single&#8208;atom Ru anchor on BaCe0.125Fe0.875O3&#8722;&#948; (BCF) perovskite, synthesized by a facile and scalable solid&#8208;state approach, as a potential cathode for PCFCs is reported. Theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that the single&#8208;atom Ru on BCF, characterized by a unique 4&#8208;coordinate Ru&#8208;O&#8208;Fe configuration, not only induces reverse hydrogen spillover but also acts as an active site for P&#8208;ORR. The application of the optimized 2Ru&#8208;BCF (2 wt.% Ru) cathode in a single cell delivers an exceptional peak power density of 1.78 W cm&#8722;2 at 700&#160;&#176;C, along with excellent operational stability over 200 h. These findings provide new insights into single&#8208;atom engineering, advancing the commercial viability of PCFCs.

         <title>Organic Gradient Homojunction via D&#8208;A Engineering Enables Photoelectric/Photothermal Dual&#8208;Assisted Catalysis Toward Full Spectrum Light&#8208;Coupled Low&#8208;Temperature Seawater Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
An organic gradient homojunction design via rational donor&#8211;acceptor engineering is proposed to establish a new class of full&#8208;spectrum responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode for solar&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based metal&#8208;air flow batteries with improved solar utilization and device energy efficiency even at lower temperatures, by exploring photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;assisted bidirectional oxygen catalysis.








Abstract
Coupling solar into metal&#8208;air batteries represents an appealing paradigm for storing intermittent solar energy and boosting device energy efficiency. Current solar&#8208;coupled metal&#8208;air systems rely on UV or visible light harvesting and suffer from inferior charge separation ability and limited solar utilization. Additionally, sunlight action behavior/mechanism in some useful scenarios (seawater electrolytes, low&#8208;temperature) is underexplored. Herein, through gradient homojunction design via donor&#8208;acceptor (D&#8208;A) engineering, it exploits a novel full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;responsive polymer homojunction photoelectrode (PGH) for sunlight&#8208;coupled seawater&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;based Zn/Na&#8208;air batteries (Zn&#8208;SWAB/Na&#8208;SWAB) with boosted sunlight utilization and energy efficiency at lower temperatures. By stacking three pre&#8208;designed analogous [A1&#8208;D1]m&#8208;[A1&#8208;D2]n copolymers with gradient energy&#8208;levels and rich heterocycles, PGH integrates separate metal&#8208;free active sites for oxygen reduction/evolution reaction (ORR/OER), efficient photothermal effect with full&#8208;spectrum&#8208;absorption, and superior photoelectric effect with high charge&#8208;separation efficiency. Thus, PGH under simulated&#8208;sunlight produces remarkably&#8208;enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight&#8208;coupled PGH&#8208;enabled Zn&#8208;SWAB and Na&#8208;SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room&#8208;temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room&#8208;temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual&#8208;promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.

Thus, PGH under simulated-sunlight produces remarkably-enhanced photocurrent up to 3.2 and 21.4 times during ORR/OER in near-neutral electrolytes. This endows sunlight-coupled PGH-enabled Zn-SWAB and Na-SWAB with low voltage gaps of 0.08/0.25&#160;V at room temperature, and 0.21/0.43&#160;V at 0&#160;&#176;C &#8211; both of which surpass most reported room-temperature results. Their energy efficiencies (84.6%/86.8%) at 0&#160;&#176;C even approach their room-temperature counterparts (93.9%/92.3%). Mechanistic studies reveal photoelectric/photothermal dual-promoted bidirectional oxygen catalysis responsible for intriguing performance.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Biplane Ion&#8208;Pairing Induced Supramolecular Assembly for High&#8208;Performance Uranium Detection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) pincer complex probe is proposed to achieve the direct recognition of anionic [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; using a new strategy where the overlapping of thick hydration shells drives an assembly. This hydration&#8208;shell&#8208;promoted assembly endows the probe with excellent specificity, a rapid response, and high sensitivity (14.89&#160;fg). This study paves the way for exploring new approaches for the direct detection of highly hydrated ions.








Abstract
It is still challenging to directly recognize the anionic species [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, the dominant species in the environment (82%&#8208;93%), using current optical probes because of the adverse effects of its thick hydration shell on binding interactions. In this study, a water&#8208;soluble Pt(II) methylated terpyridine complex ([Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+) supramolecular probe is designed to directly target [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; by a new strategy of thick hydration shell overlapping arrangement. The optical response demonstrates excellent selectivity among &#8776;30 investigated interfering substances, along with rapid response (&#8776;15&#160;s), high sensitivity (64.1&#160;nm) and dual&#8208;signals. It is confirmed both experimentally and theoretically that the superior detection performance is attributed to the formation of a unique supramolecular structure featuring biplane&#8208;like building block, bicolumnar stacking and water&#8208;bridged anionic networks, via the overlap of thick hydration shells of aligned [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722; to boost a superentropic driving force, and the distinguishable dual&#8208;signals arises from the emergence of four types of Pt&#8208;Pt interactions, generating low&#8208;energy metal&#8208;to&#8208;metal charge transfer adsorption/emission. In addition, a [Pt(CH3&#8208;tpy)NCO]+&#8208;based hydrogel platform is constructed for detecting both anionic and cationic uranium, with a detection limit of 14.89&#160;fg. This work unlocks not only a way to directly detect [UO2(CO3)3]4&#8722;, but also a new idea for sensing ions with extreme thick hydration layers.

         <title>Point Defects Enhance Cross&#8208;Plane Thermal Conductivity In Graphite</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Point defects typically reduce thermal conductivity (&#954;) by scattering heat&#8208;carrying phonons. However, introducing spiro interstitials through particle irradiation in graphite surprisingly increases cross&#8208;plane &#954; from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. The scanning transmission electron microscope and first&#8208;principles calculations reveal that these defects bridge graphene planes, increasing group velocity while reducing phonon&#8208;phonon scattering, thereby enhancing cross&#8208;plane &#954; of graphite.








Abstract
Point defects typically reduce the thermal conductivity (&#954;) of a crystal due to increased scattering of heat&#8208;carrying phonons, a mechanism that is well understood and widely used to enhance or impede heat transfer in the material for different applications. Here an opposite effect is reported where the introduction of point defects in graphite with energetic particle irradiation increases its cross&#8208;plane &#954; by nearly a factor of two, from 10.8 to 18.9 W&#160;m&#160;K&#8722;1 at room temperature. Integrated differential phase contrast imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed the creation of spiro interstitials in graphite by the irradiation. The enhancement in &#954; is attributed to a remarkable mechanism that works to the benefit of phonon propagation in both the harmonic and anharmonic terms: these spiro interstitial defects covalently bridge neighboring basal planes, simultaneously enhancing acoustic phonon group velocity and reducing phonon&#8211;phonon scattering in the graphite structure. The enhancement of &#954; reveals an unconventional role of lattice defects in heat conduction, i.e., easing the propagation of heat&#8208;carrying phonons rather than impeding them in layered materials, inspiring their applications for thermal management in heavily radiative environments.

         <title>Advancements in Understanding the Physicochemical Properties of Reticular Materials: An In Situ and Operando Spectroscopic Perspective</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review explores how in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques reveal the real&#8208;time behavior of reticular materials, including MOFs and COFs. These methods track material formation and functionalization, structural changes, defect formation, dynamic responses to external triggers, and catalytic processes. Key findings and future opportunities are highlighted, offering pathways to enhance the design and functionality of these materials.








Abstract
The application of in situ and operando spectroscopic techniques has significantly advanced the understanding of reticular materials, particularly metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and covalent organic frameworks (COFs). These techniques offer real&#8208;time insights into the dynamic structural, electronic, and chemical changes that occur within these materials during various processes, such as catalysis, sorption, and material synthesis. This review offers a comprehensive overview of key in situ and operando techniques used to investigate the formation, functionalization, and catalytic behavior of reticular materials. How these techniques have elucidated the roles of active sites, reaction intermediates, and structural transformations under reaction conditions, especially in single&#8208;site catalysis, electrocatalysis, and photocatalysis, is highlighted. The review also discusses the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead in integrating advanced spectroscopic methods with reticular materials, aiming to foster further innovation in the design and application of these versatile materials.

         <title>Conjugated Coordination Polymer Aerogels with Increased Accessibility of Well&#8208;Defined Single&#8208;Atom Metal Sites as a New Paradigm of Electrocatalysts</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A facile and general strategy is developed to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (denoted as M&#8208;CCPA, M = Ni, Cu, Zn, etc.) that can markedly increase the accessibility of their well&#8208;defined single&#8208;atom metal sites within their hierarchically porous structures with mesopores and nanopores, which can provide a wide space for the design of high&#8208;performance catalysts toward various energy&#8208;conversion systems.








Abstract
Developing high&#8208;performance single&#8208;atom catalysts (SACs) with maximum metal utilization efficiency is of significance, which presents enormous potentials to be extensively applied. It is desired yet challenging to elaborately tailor the coordination structures of active sites in SACs and simultaneously enable sufficient accessibility of these active sites to reactants. Here, a facile and general strategy to prepare conjugated coordination polymer aerogels (CCPA) with porous architectures that can markedly increase the accessibility of their elaborately&#8208;tailored active sites, which as a new electrocatalyst paradigm can fully present both the structural advantages of SACs and aerogel materials, is reported. Taking nickel (Ni) as an example, Ni&#8208;based CCPA (Ni&#8208;CCPA) and its counterpart Ni&#8208;CCP with non&#8208;aerogel feature are studied as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept case. Electrochemical measurements show that, relative to Ni&#8208;CCP, Ni&#8208;CCPA exhibits appreciably higher performance toward alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Both the experimental results and theoretical simulations unravel that the improved OER performance of Ni&#8208;CCPA arises from the accelerated OH&#8722; diffusion within its porous architecture and enhanced OH&#8722; concentration near its highly exposed active sites at its high&#8208;curvature surfaces with localized electric fields. Importantly, as evidenced by the Cu&#8208;CCPA and Zn&#8208;CCPA examples, such strategy can be promisingly applied to prepare high&#8208;performance CCPA targeted toward various catalytic reactions and beyond.

         <title>Interlocking Antiphase Boundary with 180&#176; Domain Wall in PbTiO3 &#8211; Antiphase Ferroelectric Boundary</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores the potential applications of antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) in PbTiO3 films due to the sharp, straight morphology and the interlocking feature between antiphase boundaries and 180&#176; conventional domain walls. AFPBs retain a high degree of similarity to conventional domain walls, which may serve as dividers of domains and be used in promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.








Abstract
The ferroelectric domain wall, serving as the boundary between separate data carriers based on domains, has attracted widespread interest due to its distinctive physical properties. Although the domain walls in ferroelectric materials are narrower than those in magnetic materials due to their higher lattice anisotropy, they still account for a considerable proportion in ultrathin films, reducing storage efficiency to some extent. Here, ultrathin antiphase ferroelectric boundaries (APFBs) are presented and validated their feasibility as ferroelectric domain walls. The naturally formed APFB shows a sharp and straight morphology, with the characteristic of interlocking between the antiphase boundary (APB)&#160;and conventional 180&#176; domain wall. The calculations from the density functional theory demonstrate that the APFBs undergo a significant but localized change in electronic structure. They largely retain the characteristics that are consistent with those of conventional domain walls, such as enhanced conductivity, irregular oxygen vacancy trapping energy, and vacancy&#8208;tunable physical properties. Finally, as techniques for precisely controlling the nucleation of APB developing, configurations with out&#8208;of&#8208;plane APFBs used as dividers may provide a promising strategy for miniaturizing ferroelectric devices.

         <title>Kinetics Manipulation Enabled by Solubility Control Toward 19% Organic Solar Cells via Compatible Air Coating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A twisted guest acceptor BTP&#8208;4Cl is introduced to fine&#8208;tune the solubility of host components to address the excessive aggregation issue in blade&#8208;coated processing. It is found that the twisted molecular conformation profited in inducing longer intermolecular distance and dispersing molecular distribution in the solvent. Simultaneously, the guest acceptor positively influenced the crystalization kinetics by providing nuclei seeding sites. Finally, a fine phase separation is achieved in the open&#8208;air blade&#8208;coated organic solar cells with a state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art power conversion efficiency of 19.67%.









Abstract
Blade coating is a promising tool for upscaling organic solar cells (OSCs). However, the performances of blade&#8208;coated OSCs still lag behind their spin&#8208;coated counterparts, limiting their competitive edge towards commercialization. One of the main reasons is that controlling the film aggregation kinetics and morphology becomes challenging during the transition from spin coating to blade coating, especially when using high boiling point solvents, which can result in excessive aggregation. Therefore, a deeper understanding and appraisal of film formation kinetics influenced by coating methods is crucial. In this work, it is demonstrated that ink solubility tuning by incorporating a twisted third component (BTP&#8208;4Cl) can induce rapid crystallization behavior and promote fine phase separation between the donor polymer (PM6) and the acceptor (BTP&#8208;eC9) in blade coating. As a result, a high power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.67% is obtained in OSCs (0.04 cm2), one of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art efficiencies among the reported blade&#8208;coated OSCs (19.76% for the spin&#8208;coated devices). In addition, it is found that the inhibited phase aggregation contributes to enhancing the light stability of the device. This strategy offered novel insights into the effectiveness of solubility&#8208;tuning approaches for achieving highly efficient and stable OSCs under open&#8208;air coating conditions.

         <title>Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeted Type I Photodynamic Therapy for Agonist Independent cGAS&#8208;STING Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents the synthesis of mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanodrugs containing a BODIPY&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer and a dual nanozyme for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. Their tumor therapeutic ability, dual nanozyme activities, mitochondrion&#8208;targeted cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation, and intratumoral and systemic immunositimulation capacity underscore their potential as a paradigm for efficient photoimmunotherapy.








Abstract
CGAS&#8208;STING agonists generally lead to hyperimmunity and systemic toxicity, hindering their immunotherapeutic outcomes. Herein, a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist (termed HABH) containing boron dipyrromethene (BODIPY)&#8208;derived type I photosensitizer (BDP) and Au&#160;nanoparticle&#8208;engineered hollow mesoporous silica (HMSN/AuNPs) has been fabricated for light&#8208;controlled mitochondrial stress&#8208;inducing and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING pathway activation. The HABH nanoagonist can actively target tumor tissues and release the mitochondrion&#8208;targeted BDP. Under light illumination, BDP achieves type I photodynamic therapy (PDT) in mitochondria, generating massive hydroxyl radicals (&#8226;OH) and inducing mitochondrial stress in an oxygen&#8208;independent manner, promoting the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA). Simultaneously, the HMSN/AuNPs act as dual nanozymes to derive cascade reactions for &#8226;OH production, elevating the intracellular oxidative state, and together with the BDP&#8208;induced mitochondrial stress, finally evoking the cGAS&#8208;STING pathway and facilitating the release of type I interferon. In the orthotopic breast tumor models, the HABH nanoagonist achieved intratumoral and systemic immunoactivation for eradicating primary tumors and preventing metastasis tumors. Therefore, the constructed mitochondrion&#8208;targeted nanoagonist enabled light&#8208;controlled and agonist&#8208;independent cGAS&#8208;STING activation, providing a paradigm for photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>An Integrated Virtual Screening Platform to Identify Potent Co&#8208;Assembled Nanodrugs for Cancer Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work uses ligand&#8208;based virtual screening&#160;(LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to construct a high&#8208;throughput screening platform, which can be used to identify small molecule combinations with potential co&#8208;assembly ability.








Abstract
Co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs provide significant advantages in cancer treatment and drug delivery, yet effective screening methods to identify molecular combinations for co&#8208;assembly are lacking. This study presents a screening strategy integrating ligand&#8208;based virtual screening (LBVS) and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to explore new molecular combinations with co&#8208;assembly capabilities. The accuracy of this screening was validated by synthesizing various co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs under mild conditions. Vinpocetine (Vin) and lenvatinib (Len) are representative co&#8208;assembly combinations that can directly co&#8208;assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) through hydrogen bonding, van der Waals forces, and &#960;&#8208;&#960; interactions. These NPs were further functionalized with polyethylene glycol (PEG), resulting in PEG&#8208;L/V NPs that exhibited enhanced stability and biocompatibility. In addition, PEG&#8208;L/V NPs can respond to acidic conditions and release Vin and Len, working synergistically to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in tumor cells in vitro while also inhibiting xenograft tumor growth in vivo. RNA sequencing (RNA&#8208;seq) analysis revealed that the co&#8208;assembled nanodrugs exhibited mechanisms that are distinct from those of single drugs. This study demonstrates the feasibility of utilizing a computational approach combining LBVS and DFT to identify small molecules with co&#8208;assembly capabilities, leading to innovative anticancer strategies.

         <title>Lab&#8208;in&#8208;Cell: A Covalent Photosensitizer Reverses Hypoxia and Evokes Ferroptosis and Pyroptosis for Enhanced Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
The covalent warhead alkynamide is incorporated into an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer, developing a redox systems&#8208;targeting covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;PA. It is aimed at disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system, alleviating hypoxia, and evoking ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA&#8208;NPs at the tumor led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects.








Abstract
Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non&#8208;invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor&#8208;associated antigens and damage&#8208;associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP&#8208;PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis&#8208; and pyroptosis&#8208;mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol&#8208;yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non&#8208;covalent photosensitizer MBTP&#8208;A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP&#8208;PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol&#8208;yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.

&lt;p&gt;Photodynamic immunotherapy presents a non-invasive strategy characterized by spatiotemporal control and minimal side effects to induce immunogenic cell death (ICD). This approach significantly enhances the release of tumor-associated antigens and damage-associated molecular patterns, thereby improving cancer immunotherapy outcomes. However, hypoxia and antioxidant defenses at tumor sites considerably diminish the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy. In this work, a covalent warhead, alkyneamide, is introduced into an AIE photosensitizer to develop a novel covalent photosensitizer, MBTP-PA, which targets redox systems and facilitates ferroptosis- and pyroptosis-mediated photodynamic immunotherapy by thiol-yne click reactions. The covalent photosensitizer interacts with intracellular thiol compounds such as cysteine and glutathione, disrupting the intracellular antioxidant system and alleviating hypoxia. This results in enhanced photodynamic therapy (PDT) efficacy compared to the non-covalent photosensitizer MBTP-A. Furthermore, in conjunction with PDT, this reaction therapy can activate ICD through ferroptosis and pyroptosis, thereby enhancing anti-tumor immunity. Notably, in vivo injection of MBTP-PA nanoparticles at the tumor site led to the elimination of primary tumors, inhibiting distal tumors and exhibiting minimal side effects. Therefore, this work not only integrates the thiol-yne click reactions into cellular systems, significantly enhancing the efficacy of photodynamic immunotherapy but also paves the way for developing novel photosensitizers.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Strong Proquinoidal Acceptor Enables High&#8208;Performance Ambipolar Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Proquinoidal building blocks are demonstrated that could enable a narrow bandgap while facilitating the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, making them ideal for high&#8208;performance ambipolar OECTs. Using this strategy, a record&#8208;breaking ambipolar OECT material featuring high &#181;C*, low operating voltage, and rapid response is developed.








Abstract
Ambipolar organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) can simplify manufacturing processes and reduce device footprints, yet their performance still lags behind their p&#8208;type and n&#8208;type counterparts due to limited molecular design strategies. Here, incorporating strong proquinoidal building blocks effectively addresses this challenge is demonstrated. Using a computational acceptor screening approach, three TBDOPV&#8208;based polymers are designed and synthesized: P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;T), P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT), and P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;MeOT2), all exhibiting ambipolar behavior across various donor moieties. Remarkably, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) achieves record&#8208;high figure&#8208;of&#8208;merit (&#181;C*) values, reaching 268&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for p&#8208;type and 107&#160;F&#160;cm&#8722;1&#160;V&#8722;1&#160;s&#8722;1 for n&#8208;type operations. Additionally, P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) exhibits low operation voltages (VTh,p&#160;=&#160;&#8722;0.55&#160;V and VTh,n&#160;=&#160;0.32&#160;V), with fast response times (&#964;on/&#964;off = 0.48/0.36&#160;ms for p&#8208;type and 0.41/0.41&#160;ms for n&#8208;type) and enhanced operational stability. Inverter devices based on P(bgTBDOPV&#8208;EDOT) show high voltage gains of 173&#160;V/V. Theoretical calculations and data analysis confirm that strong proquinoidal acceptors significantly enhance the delocalization of both positive and negative polarons, offering an effective pathway for higher&#8208;performance ambipolar OECT materials.

         <title>Homo&#8208;Hetero Double Junction Coupling Weakens Exciton Effects to Enhance Selective Photocatalytic O2 Activation on Carbon Nitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Through the homo&#8208;hetero double&#8208;junction coupling strategy, the directional electron&#8211;hole migration is precisely regulated, and the exciton effect is substantially weakened. Under the strong built&#8208;in electric field, the FO/HCCN surface exhibits typical charge&#8208;carrier behavior, which achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2.








Abstract
Exciton effects caused by the inherent dielectric confinement in the 2D material carbon nitride (CN) severely limit the transfer of photogenerated carriers and the selective generation of free radicals. Herein, a homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy is reported to address these challenges. Ternary homojunction carbon nitride (HCCN) functionalized with cyano and cyanamide groups is constructed with a built&#8208;in electric field that efficiently separates the electron&#8211;hole into different structural units, thereby reducing reverse charge recombination and weakening exciton effects. The introduction of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 (FO) subsequently constructs the homo&#8208;hetero double junction catalyst FO/HCCN with a built&#8208;in electric field 127 times stronger than HCCN, which promotes the directional migration of carriers after exciton dissociation and achieves &#8776;100% selective generation of &#183;O2&#8722; from O2. These results suggest that FO/HCCN achieves 99.6% removal of tetracycline within 20&#160;min, with a degradation rate 12 and 46 times higher than FO/CN and HCCN, respectively. In addition, the system shows excellent stability and cyclability in real&#8208;life light experiments and trace organic contaminant removal. This homo&#8208;hetero double junction coupling strategy opens up new avenues in weakening exciton effects and precisely controlling the generation of free radicals.

         <title>Radioactive Diselenide Bonded Covalent Organic Framework</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A covalent organic framework (COF) with a diselenide bond is rationally designed as a radioactive PANoptosis inducer to potentiate tumor radiosensitivity. This diselenide COF effectively promotes the formation of Z&#8208;DNA, and reprograms the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy, and making it a promising candidate for cancer treatment.








Abstract
Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) are porous crystals of high potential in biomedical applications. The chemical bonds within COF structures are critical for the overall therapeutic performance. Here, the design and synthesis of radioactive COF are reported by introducing labile diselenide bonds into the structure backbone. This diselenide bonded COF, PorSe&#8208;CuPt, constructed from Cu and Pt ion porphyrin units, is capable of bond cleavage upon irradiation, thus releasing the drug molecule, CBL0137, carried in the pores. Concerted with the promotion of X&#8208;ray absorption by Pt2&#8314; and the enrichment of oxygen by Cu2&#8314;, robust PANoptosis is achieved as well as improved immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, thereby drastically enhancing the overall effectiveness of radiotherapy. The integration of diselenide bonds into the COF backbone demonstrates the possible application of clip&#8208;off chemistry in the search for highly responsible and compatible biomaterials.

         <title>Directly Printed 3D Soft Microwave Plasmonic Enhanced&#8208;Q Resonators by Decoupling from Lossy Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional 2D plasmonic resonators are limited to be employed onto soft electronic platforms owing to the attenuation caused by lossy media. To overcome this, directly printed 3D plasmonic resonator configurations are developed with highly conductive elastomeric composites. These 3D soft resonators demonstrate wireless, multidirectional strain&#8208;sensing capabilities with higher quality factor resonances than their 2D counterparts, enabling advanced sensing applications.









Abstract
Soft electronic components are essential building blocks for realizing form&#8208;factor&#8208;free applications; however, most designs are confined to 2D or 2.5D structures due to challenges in maintaining 3D structural integrity. This limitation is particularly critical for electromagnetic devices, such as resonators, where dielectric losses from elastomeric substrates severely hinder high&#8208;performance functionality. Here, directly printed 3D electromagnetic soft plasmonic enhanced&#8208;quality(Q) factor resonators are proposed, using highly conductive composites. By incorporating an immiscible solvent into an elastomer matrix, emulsion phases are formed that significantly enhance the storage modulus, enabling the fabrication of 3D&#8208;printed structures while improving their electrical conductivity. 3D microwave plasmonic resonators with a high degree of design freedom, such as pillars and hooks are demonstrated. These structures exhibit improved resistance to dielectric interference by leveraging the resonance in lossless air. Moreover, integrating a coplanar ground plane further decouples the resonators from lossy substrates, resulting in a 3.4&#8208;fold enhancement in the Q&#8208;factor (octupole mode) compared to 2D resonators. This improvement enables stable operation on high&#8208;permittivity surfaces, such as human skin. Additionally, a single 3D resonator demonstrates wireless deformation&#8208;sensing capabilities, facilitating the simultaneous detection of strain amplitude and orientation. This result can pave the way for advanced sensing applications in soft electronics.

         <title>A Universal Solution for Direct Regeneration of Spent Lithium Iron Phosphate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
Design criteria for a lithiation solution that enables spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions for the direct regeneration of spent LiFePO4 are proposed. Using machine learning (ML), the redox potentials of various solution systems are identified and revealed a critical relationship: the lower the redox potential, the more effective the lithiation of degraded LiFePO4 materials.








Abstract
Lithiation reactions driven by chemical potential offer a promising avenue for directly regenerating degraded lithium iron phosphate (LFP). However, the choice of solution system significantly influences the lithium supplementation where improper selection may result in poor lithium recovery or extremely slow kinetics. Herein, it is identified that the most critical factor affecting solution repair effectiveness is the redox potential of the anions in the solution, which determines whether spent LFP (SLFP) can undergo spontaneous lithiation under ambient conditions. Then, machine learning (ML) is used for prediction and screening of huge potential solution systems, and finally a general strategy is proposed: creating a low redox potential solution system that incorporates anions with either low redox potential or moderate redox potential at high concentrations. As a demonstration, the regenerated LFP by ascorbic acid and LiOH solution systems exhibits a high discharge capacity of 144 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C, retaining 96% of its capacity after 500 cycles at 5 C. This work establishes an important criteria for designing solution systems to restore degraded LFP, marking a significant advancement in the direct regeneration of cathode materials from spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs).

         <title>Exploring Structure Diversity in Atomic Resolution Microscopy With Graph</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work describes a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network to automatically analyze a library of atomic structures (vacancies, grain boundaries, stacking configurations, etc.) represented by graphs. This framework significantly promotes robustness, reduces computing parameters by three orders of magnitude compared to the image&#8208;driven learning framework, and facilitates new structure and knowledge discovery.








Abstract
The emergence of deep learning (DL) has provided great opportunities for the high&#8208;throughput analysis of atomic&#8208;resolution micrographs. However, the DL models trained by image patches in fixed size generally lack efficiency and flexibility when processing micrographs containing diversified atomic configurations. Herein, inspired by the similarity between the atomic structures and graphs, a few&#8208;shot learning framework based on an equivariant graph neural network (EGNN) to analyze a library of atomic structures (e.g., vacancies, phases, grain boundaries, doping, etc.) is described, showing significantly promoted robustness and three orders of magnitude reduced computing parameters compared to the image&#8208;driven DL models, which is especially evident for those aggregated vacancy lines with flexible lattice distortion. Besides, the intuitiveness of graphs enables quantitative and straightforward extraction of the atomic&#8208;scale structural features in batches, thus statistically unveiling the self&#8208;assembly dynamics of vacancy lines under electron beam irradiation. A versatile model toolkit is established by integrating EGNN sub&#8208;models for single structure recognition to process images involving varied configurations in the form of a task chain, leading to the discovery of novel doping configurations with superior electrocatalytic properties for hydrogen evolution reactions. This work provides a powerful tool to explore structure diversity in a fast, accurate, and intelligent manner.

         <title>Biomimetic rhCOL17&#8208;P334 Conjugate for Enhanced Wound Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a novel bioscaffold combining recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to create a transparent, injectable hydrogel (GCP) for enhanced wound healing. GCP integrates extracellular matrix&#8208;like cues with UVA shielding properties, preventing fibroblast senescence and improving repair outcomes. This platform offers significant potential for advanced, protective wound management.








Abstract
Wound healing remains a significant global health challenge, affecting millions annually and imposing substantial economic burdens. Most commercially available biomaterials for wound management primarily address external symptoms, including hemostasis, exudation, scarring, and infection. Advanced biomaterials derived from endogenous molecules aim to better replicate the native wound microenvironment, promoting enhanced repair. Since wounds frequently occur on exposed skin, which is vulnerable to UVA radiation and requires protective yet invisible materials, traditional wound care products often lack these essential features. Inspired by natural UV protection mechanisms, a novel bioscaffold is developed using recombinant human collagen XVII (rhCOL17) crosslinked with porphyra&#8208;334 (P334) to improve wound healing under UVA exposure. The resulting rhCOL17&#8208;P334 conjugate integrates extracellular matrix (ECM)&#8208;like cues with UVA&#8208;shielding properties provided by P334. This conjugate is used to construct a transparent, injectable hydrogel combining gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) and rhCOL17&#8208;P334 (GCP). GCP significantly inhibits UVA&#8208;induced fibroblast senescence and improves wound healing outcomes by targeting integrin &#945;6&#946;4 through rhCOL17. Its transparency facilitates convenient wound monitoring while also addressing the aesthetic requirement for invisibility. By combining UVA shielding with wound repair capabilities, GCP presents a promising platform for advanced wound management.

         <title>Nonlocal Conduction in a Metawire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, EarlyView. </description>
         <dc:description>
A 1D metawire composed of twisted copper wires is designed and realized. This metamaterial exhibits pronounced effects of nonlocal electric conduction according to Ohm's law. The current at one location not only depends on the electric field at that location but also on other locations. As a result, the resistance of the metawire oscillates as a function of its length.








Abstract
Ohm's law of electric conduction is local in the sense that the current density at one position only depends on the electric field at that same position. For a nonlocal medium, the current density at one position depends on the electric field at other positions within the medium as well. As a result of Ohm's law, doubling the length of a wire doubles its resistance. Here, electrically conducting nonlocal architectures are discussed theoretically and experimentally for which changing the length of the metawire rather leads to a complex oscillatory behavior versus wire length. This oscillatory behavior is connected to local currents inside of the metawire flowing in the opposite direction than the externally applied field. The theoretical and experimental results for electric conduction can directly be transferred to thermal conduction or particle diffusion and may enable remote sensing applications.

         <title>Performance&#8208;Oriented and Deformation&#8208;Constrained Dual&#8208;topology Metamaterial with High&#8208;Stress Uniformity and Extraordinary Plastic Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The TCPL based on a multidimensional performance expansion strategy has performance indexes that are much higher than those of existing multicellular materials. By incorporating a deformation constraint strategy into TCPL, ETCPL has high&#8208;stress uniformity and extraordinary plastic properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. Besides, the strength&#8208;density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed predictions of Gibson&#8211;Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum.








Abstract
The study of classical mechanical metamaterials has overwhelmingly remained at the elastic stage, while the increase in extreme speeds of vehicles and aircraft has created an urgent need and demanding requirements for excellent plasticity performance. Although some plastically deformable metamaterials exist, high initial peak stresses, short plastic strokes, and low plastic stresses limit their applications considerably. Here, an ideal malleable large&#8208;deformation metamaterial featuring high&#8208;stress levels and stability is reported. A performance&#8208;oriented multidimensional performance expansion strategy is adopted to obtain the bionic triangular corrugation&#8208;based plate lattice (TCPL) metamaterial. Then, the deformation constraint strategy that TCPL is innovatively used as the main topology with lateral expansion and buckling inhibited by the inserted enhancing topology is proposed, thus obtaining the built&#8208;in dual&#8208;topology enhanced TCPL (ETCPL). The ETCPL is again substantially strengthened in stress uniformity with almost no gradient and mechanical properties with strain energy improved by 51.56%. They are much more robust than typical multicellular materials, with the largest performance enhancement reaching 18 667.19%. In addition, the strength&#8208;density performances of both metamaterials significantly exceed the predictions of Gibson&#8211;Ashby model up to 75.2% maximum. The unprecedented performance confirms that multidimensional performance expansion strategy and deformation constraint strategy have created new design guidelines for ideal high&#8208;performance plastic metamaterials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Fast, Unidirectional Water Absorption on Wood Ear</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption is observed on the abaxial surface of wood ear, featuring dense micro&#8208;sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;pores. The synergistic lateral and vertical wicking reduces droplet absorption time by two orders of magnitude compared to the un&#8208;hairy porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). This unique absorption mechanism holds significant potential for liquid manipulation in porous media.








Abstract
Materials exhibiting rapid, unidirectional liquid absorption are desirable for comfort textiles and wound dressings. Implementing chemical or structural gradient along the vertical axis of substrates is an effective way to achieve such properties. Liquid's lateral spreading across the substrate affects area occurring vertical imbibition. However, the influence of lateral spreading on liquid's overall absorption remains unexplored. Findings on ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption on the abhymenium of wood ear fungi are presented, featuring dense micro&#8208;sized hairs atop a porous sublayer containing smaller micro&#8208;/nano&#8208;pores. These hairs facilitate lateral spreading, and the gradient&#8208;sized structures from the surface hairs to the internal pores enhance capillary force, promoting efficient vertical imbibition. The synergistic wicking mechanism in both directions shortens absorption time of a 1&#8208;&#181;L droplet by two orders of magnitude compared to a solely porous surface (35 ms vs 5.2 s). An artificial micro&#8208;pillar array on a porous substrate also exhibits ultra&#8208;fast, unidirectional water absorption. This study advances the understanding of liquid dynamics in porous media and provides a blueprint for engineering materials with superior liquid management.

         <title>Molecular Imaging of Ovarian Follicles and Tumors With Near&#8208;Infrared II Bioconjugates</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Employing near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) imaging with indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;conjugated recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein allows for precise visualization of early follicles. This technique aids in the tracking of follicular development, ovarian vasculature, and ovarian tumors, exceeding the spatial capabilities of ultrasound and MRI. The approach provides new perspectives into infertility conditions and tumor monitoring.








Abstract
Follicular tracking is typically conducted using ultrasound technology, but its effectiveness is constrained by limited resolution. High&#8208;resolution imaging of deep tissues can be accomplished using luminescence imaging in the near&#8208;infrared II window (NIR&#8208;II, 1000&#8211;1700&#160;nm); however, the contrast agents that are used lack specificity. Here, it is reported that the FDA&#8208;approved indocyanine green (ICG)&#8208;conjugated recombinant human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) protein can target early follicles with long&#8208;term effectiveness. A novel high&#8208;resolution NIR&#8208;II imaging approach is developed for monitoring follicular development as well as ovulation using multi&#8208;color imaging of ovarian vessels with a combination of non&#8208;overlapping downconversion nanoparticles (DCNPs). The results showed that the ability to monitor early follicles of around 50&#160;&#181;m in diameter exceeded the spatial and temporal resolution of ultrasound or MRI without the reproductive damage associated with computed tomography radiation, and this enabled the clinical identification of the follicular reserve in patients with infertility diseases such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). In addition, NIR&#8208;II imaging clearly targeted ovarian tumors and showed micro&#8208;metastatic lesions, thus providing a new tool for monitoring tumors in vivo and guiding surgical resection.

         <title>Efficient Blade&#8208;Coated Wide&#8208;Bandgap and Tandem Perovskite Solar Cells via a Three&#8208;Step Restraining Strategy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Strict control of crystal growth has historically limited the efficiency of blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells compared to spin&#8208;coated devices. Here, a three&#8208;step restraining strategy that employs a functional additive to regulate crystal growth enables efficient blade&#8208;coated perovskite solar cells. This approach achieves a 19.97% efficiency for single&#8208;junction 1.77 eV wide&#8208;bandgap cells and a 27.11% efficiency for 2&#8208;terminal all&#8208;perovskite tandem solar cells.








Abstract
Blade&#8208;coating techniques have attracted significant attention for perovskite solar cells (PSCs)&#160;due to their high precursor utilization and simplicity. However, the power conversion efficiency (PCE) of blade&#8208;coated PSCs often lags behind that of spin&#8208;coated devices, mainly due to difficulties in precisely controlling perovskite film formation during pre&#8208;nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation, and crystallization in the blade&#8208;coating and N2&#8208;knife drying processes. In this work, a three&#8208;step restraining strategy is introduced utilizing functional glycine amide hydrochloride to regulate pre&#8208;nucleation clustering, suppress excessive heterogeneous nucleation, and decelerate crystallization, enabling comprehensive control of the perovskite film formation processes. This approach results in enlarged grains, reduced defect densities, and highly oriented crystalline wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite films with significantly prolonged carrier lifetimes, achieving a maximum PCE of 19.97% for 1.77 eV&#8208;bandgap blade&#8208;coated PSCs. Furthermore, two&#8208;terminal tandem cells, composed of wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite top cells and 1.25 eV&#8208;bandgap perovskite bottom cells fabricated via blade coating, yield an impressive PCE of 27.11% (stabilized at 26.87%). This study offers comprehensive insights into controlling pre&#8208;nucleation, heterogeneous nucleation, and crystallization during blade coating, providing valuable guidance for developing high&#8208;performance, large&#8208;area devices in the future.

Abstract
Lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems seek to leverage microfluidic chips to enable small&#8208;scale fluid manipulation, holding significant potential to revolutionize science and industry. However, existing microfluidic chips have been largely designed with static fluid structures for specific single&#8208;purpose applications, which lack adaptability and flexibility for diverse applications. Inspired by the general&#8208;purpose design strategy of the customizable chip of integrated circuit &#8211; field programmable gate array whose hardware can be reconfigured via software programming for multifunctionality after manufacturing, a conceptual&#8208;new reconfigurable microfluidic chip &#8212; field programmable topographic morphing array (FPTMA) is devised with exceptional structural reconfiguration, field programmability, and function scalability for general&#8208;purpose lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems that beyond the reach of current state&#8208;of&#8208;art lab&#8208;on&#8208;chip systems. FPTMA can be software programmed to dynamically shape an elastic meta&#8208;interface from the initial smooth structure into desired time&#8208;varying topographic structures and thus generate spatiotemporal topographic&#8208;morphing&#8208;induced capillary forces to actively manipulate multidroplets in parallel and enable real&#8208;time reconfiguring diverse microfluidic operations/functions/flow networks as well as workflows. It is envisioned that the development of the FPTMA&#8208;driven lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip systems that leverage dynamic interfacial topographies to digitally handle microfluidics would significantly stimulate numerous technological innovations in biology/medicine/chemistry.

Combining the pixelated design with multi&#8208;materials of different photocarrier responses and triggering switches, the photon&#8208;induced multitemporal ultrafast programming is achieved in a Terahertz metadevice with the broadband and multiple polarization states. With this, time&#8208; and frequency&#8208;switchable logic devices are demonstrated at a picosecond scale, which facilitates miniaturized light&#8208;driven devices and integrated wave elements for optical computing, high&#8208;quality communication, quantum, nonlinear optics, and others.








Abstract
Dynamic terahertz (THz) metasurface can feature modulated and multiplexed electromagnetic functionalities, important for wave&#8208;based computation, six&#8208;generation communications, and other applications. The versatile dynamic switching typically relies on a series of complex or incompatible multifield activations, with excessive system complexity, additional loss, slow modulation speed, and inertial time&#8208;varying properties, limiting more widespread applications. Here, a photon&#8208;induced ultrafast programmable THz metadevice is reoprted in time&#8208;frequency dimensions with polarization&#8208;decoupled temporal responses. By the pixelated design with multi&#8208;materials and triggering switches, the multimodal modulation transcends the constraints inherent in materials, enabling the ultrafast programmable temporal evolution. All the resonances can be independently programmed at the working band from 0.6 to 2 THz. The tri&#8208;temporal (with switching time of 1.25, 1, and 4.75&#160;ps) and bi&#8208;temporal (with switching time of 2.25 and 4.75&#160;ps) dynamic manipulations are performed by all&#8208;optical driven molecularization process of hybrid metasurfaces loaded with silicon (Si)&#160;and germanium (Ge) under different polarizations. Combining these features, the temporally programmed THz logic gates are last experimentally demonstrated, possessing basic operation of XNOR, NOR, and OR,&#160;as a proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application. This reported light&#8208;driven programmable THz flat&#8208;optics allows ultrafast hybrid molecularization processes and new possibilities for miniaturized, flexible, multifunctional, and temporally programmable integrated devices.

Fast Liquid Absorption
A type of delicious fungus, wood ear, displays exceptional water absorption capability on one of its surfaces due to the dense micro&#8208;sized hairs on its porous sublayer. This unique structure facilitates simultaneous lateral spreading and vertical imbibition, resulting in rapid, unidirectional water absorption. More details can be found in article number 2413364 by Yu&#8208;Qiong Luo, Jie Ju, and co&#8208;workers.

         <title>Critical Role of Nanomaterial Mechanical Properties in Drug Delivery, Nanovaccines and Beyond</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous nanomedicines are developed to revolutionize disease management. Due to the diverse materials and methods used in fabricating nanomedicines, their mechanical properties can vary significantly, which have increasingly been recognized as a critical factor influencing therapeutic efficacy. This review systematically addresses the impact of nanomedicines&#8217; mechanical properties on their biomedical performance, offering valuable insights for future developments in the field.








Abstract
Nanomaterials have become essential in the daily lives, finding applications in food, skincare, drugs, and vaccines. Traditionally, the surface chemistry of nanoparticles (NPs) is considered the key factor in determining their interactions with biological systems. However, recent studies have shown that the mechanical properties of nanomaterials are equally important in regulating nano&#8208;bio interactions, though they have often been overlooked. Tuning the mechanical properties of nanomaterials and designing&#160;them for biomedical applications is thus crucial. This review begins by discussing the various mechanical cues in biological processes, including how viruses and cells adjust their mechanical properties throughout their life cycles. Basic concepts and terminology related to NP mechanical properties are introduced. Next, five different groups of nanomaterials with tunable mechanical properties are explored. The review then examines the impact of NP mechanical properties on their interactions in vitro and in vivo, covering tumor&#8208;targeted drug delivery, nanovaccines, and emerging applications such as oral and intranasal drug delivery. Current challenges in the field and perspectives on future developments are also provided.

         <title>Understanding the Dynamic Evolution of Active Sites among Single Atoms, Clusters, and Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review highlights the dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles under reaction conditions and the subsequent the influence on catalytic property. This review is instrumental in providing enlightening insights into the dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles and contributes to in&#8208;depth understanding of changes in catalytic activity under reaction conditions.








Abstract
Catalysis remains a cornerstone of chemical research, with the active sites of catalysts being crucial for their functionality. Identifying active sites, particularly during the reaction process, is crucial for elucidating the relationship between a catalyst's structure and its catalytic property. However, the dynamic evolution of active sites within heterogeneous metal catalysts presents a substantial challenge for accurately pinpointing the real active sites. The advent of in situ and operando characterization techniques has illuminated the path toward understanding the dynamic changes of active sites, offering robust scientific evidence to support the rational design of catalysts. There is a pressing need for a comprehensive review that systematically explores the dynamic evolution among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles as active sites during the reaction process, utilizing in situ and operando characterization techniques. This review aims to delineate the effects of various reaction factors on dynamic evolution of active sites among single atoms, clusters, and nanoparticles. Moreover, several in situ and operando techniques are elaborated with emphases on tracking the dynamic evolution of active sites, linking them to catalytic properties. Finally, it discusses challenges and future perspectives in identifying active sites during the reaction process and advancing in situ and operando characterization techniques.

This review discusses defect engineering strategies for metal&#8208;based atomically thin materials (M&#8208;ATMs) to enhance their catalytic performance in electrochemical reactions, addressing challenges like insufficient active sites and slow kinetics, while exploring their potential in promoting a circular economy.








Abstract
Recently, metal&#8208;based atomically thin materials (M&#8208;ATMs) have experienced rapid development due to their large specific surface areas, abundant electrochemically accessible sites, attractive surface chemistry, and strong in&#8208;plane chemical bonds. These characteristics make them highly desirable for energy&#8208;related conversion reactions. However, the insufficient active sites and slow reaction kinetics leading to unsatisfactory electrocatalytic performance limited their commercial application. To address these issues, defect engineering of M&#8208;ATMs has emerged to increase the active sites, modify the electronic structure, and enhance the catalytic reactivity and stability. This review provides a comprehensive summary of defect engineering strategies for M&#8208;ATM nanostructures, including vacancy creation, heteroatom doping, amorphous phase/grain boundary generation, and heterointerface construction. Introducing recent advancements in the application of M&#8208;ATMs in electrochemical small molecule conversion reactions (e.g., hydrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, nitrogen, and sulfur), which can contribute to a circular economy by recycling molecules like H2, O2, CO2, N2, and S. Furthermore, a crucial link between the reconstruction of atomic&#8208;level structure and catalytic activity via analyzing the dynamic evolution of M&#8208;ATMs during the reaction process is established. The review also outlines the challenges and prospects associated with M&#8208;ATM&#8208;based catalysts to inspire further research efforts in developing high&#8208;performance M&#8208;ATMs.

         <title>Single Atom Cocatalysts in Photocatalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Single&#8208;atom cocatalysts (SACs) in photocatalysis are comprehensively discussed, with a focus on often&#8208;overlooked aspects of general concepts and understanding. Key principles, challenges, and recent advancements are covered, highlighting the self&#8208;homing effect as a promising avenue for designing SACs with maximized efficiency and unexpected features.








Abstract
Single&#8208;atom (SA) cocatalysts (SACs) have garnered significant attention in photocatalysis due to their unique electronic properties and high atom utilization efficiency. This review provides an overview of the concept and principles of SA cocatalyst in photocatalysis, emphasizing the intrinsic differences to SAs used in classic chemical catalysis. Key factors that influence the efficiency of SAs in photocatalytic reactions, particularly in photocatalytic hydrogen (H2) production, are highlighted. This review further covers synthesis methods, stabilization strategies, and characterization techniques for common SAs used in photocatalysis. Notably, &#8220;reactive deposition&#8221; method, which often shows a self&#8208;homing effect and thus achieves a maximum utilization efficiency of SA cocatalysts, is emphasized. Furthermore, the applications of SA cocatalysts in various photocatalytic processes, including H2 evolution, carbon dioxide reduction, nitrogen fixation, and organic synthesis, are comprehensively reviewed, along with insights into common artifacts in these applications. This review concludes by addressing the challenges faced by SACs in photocatalysis and offering perspectives on future developments, with the aim of informing and advancing research on SAs for photocatalytic energy conversion.

         <title>PEDOTs&#8208;Based Conductive Hydrogels: Design, Fabrications, and Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this review, the authors comprehensively examine the design strategies, fabrication technologies, and diverse applications of P&#8208;CHs. By summarizing design strategies, such as molecular, network, phase, and structural engineering, and exploring both 2D and 3D fabrication techniques, it offers a comprehensive overview of P&#8208;CHs applications in diverse fields including bioelectronics, soft actuators, energy devices, and solar evaporators.








Abstract
Conductive hydrogels combine the benefits of soft hydrogels with electrical conductivity and have gained significant attention over the past decade. These innovative materials, including poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOTs)&#8208;based conductive hydrogels (P&#8208;CHs), are promising for flexible electronics and biological applications due to their tunable flexibility, biocompatibility, and hydrophilicity. Despite the recent advances, the intrinsic correlation between the design, fabrications, and applications of P&#8208;CHs has been mostly based on trial&#8208;and&#8208;error&#8208;based Edisonian approaches, significantly limiting their further development. This review comprehensively examines the design strategies, fabrication technologies, and diverse applications of P&#8208;CHs. By summarizing design strategies, such as molecular, network, phase, and structural engineering, and exploring both 2D and 3D fabrication techniques, this review offers a comprehensive overview of P&#8208;CHs applications in diverse fields including bioelectronics, soft actuators, energy devices, and solar evaporators. Establishing this critical internal connection between design, fabrication, and application aims to guide future research and stimulate innovation in the field of functional P&#8208;CHs, offering broad benefits to multidisciplinary researchers.

         <title>Emerging 0D Hybrid Metal Halide Luminescent Glasses</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review performs the thermodynamic analysis to elaborate the solid&#8208;liquid phase transition in 0D hybrid metal halide (HMH) glasses and further summarizes the chemical design and structural characterization, luminescence properties, and glass crystallization behaviors. The perspective can provide guidance for the future research direction of 0D HMH glasses and promote their development in optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
0D hybrid metal halide (HMH) luminescent glasses have garnered significant attentions for its chemical diversity in optoelectronic applications and it also retains the skeleton connectivity and coordination mode of the crystalline counterparts while exhibiting various physics/chemistry characteristics distinct from the crystalline states. However, understanding of the glass&#8208;forming ability and the specific structural origins underpinning the luminescent properties of 0D HMH glasses remains elusive. In this review, it is started from the solid&#8208;liquid phase transition and thermodynamic analysis of 0D HMHs formed through melt&#8208;quenching, and summarize the current compounds capable of stably forming glassy phases via chemical structural design. The structural characterization methods are further discussed and highlight the exceptional transparency, specific luminescent properties, and glass crystallization behaviors. Moreover, the application prospects demonstrated by these 0D HMH glasses have been presented accordingly in X&#8208;ray detection and imaging, anti&#8208;counterfeiting, and information encryption. Finally, perspective is offered into the future development of this emerging family of 0D HMH glasses and their applications.

         <title>Experimental and Theoretical Force Constants as Meaningful Indicator for Interatomic Bonding Characteristics and the Specific Case of Elemental Antimony</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study investigates experimental and theoretical force constants of antimony. Comparison with other materials indicates a continuous transition from multicenter bonding to covalent bonding characteristics. This makes the force constants a clear indicator for the degree of multicenter bonding in electron&#8208;rich materials and a fingerprint in material screening for future phase change material or thermoelectric applications. 








Abstract
Stable Sb exhibits a rhombohedral structure, often referred to as distorted primitive cubic, with each Sb atom having three short and three longer first neighbor bonds. However, this crystal structure can also be interpreted as being layered, putting emphasis on only three short first neighbor bonds. Therefore, temperature&#8208;dependent extended X&#8208;ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopy is carried out at the Sb K&#8208;edge in order to obtain more detailed information on local structural and vibrational properties. Evaluation of the temperature&#8208;dependent bond lengths provides the temperature&#8208;dependent Peierls distortion while the temperature dependence of the variance of the interatomic distance distribution yields the EXAFS force constants. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) calculations are used for determining projected force constants. Both EXAFS and DFT force constants are compared to those of other materials with different bonding characteristics, including two&#8208;center covalently bonded semiconductors, multicenter bonded IV&#8211;VI and V2VI3 compounds, and metallic Cu. Clearly, Sb exhibits characteristics of both localized covalent bonding and delocalized multicenter bonding. This suggests a continuous transition between these two bonding scenarios and adds to the understanding of bonding in elemental Sb in particular and in IV&#8211;VI and V2VI3 materials in general.

         <title>Efficient Electrosynthesis of Hydrogen Peroxide Enabled by a Hierarchical Hollow RE&#8211;P&#8211;O (RE = Sm, La, Gd) Architecture with Open Channels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Rare earth phosphates with hexagonal crystal structure have been demonstrated to exhibit impressive 2e&#8722; ORR performance over a wide potential and pH range, which can be attributed to their enriched open channels, large specific surface feature, optimal metal spatial distance, unwavering compositional stability as well as favorable electronic structure.








Abstract
The electrochemical two&#8208;electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e&#8722; ORR) offers a sustainable pathway for the production of H2O2; however, the development of electrocatalysts with exceptional activity, selectivity, and long&#8208;term stability remains a challenging task. Herein, a novel approach is presented to addressing this challenge by synthesizing hierarchical hollow SmPO4 nanospheres with open channels via a two&#8208;step hydrothermal treatment. The produced compound demonstrates remarkable 2e&#8722; selectivity, exceeding 93% across a wide potential range of 0.0&#8211;0.6&#160;V in 0.1&#160;m KOH, with a peak of 96% at 0.45&#160;V. When employed as the cathode in a flow cell, the synthesized SmPO4 exhibits impressive stability at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 12&#160;h, consistently achieving a Faradaic efficiency above 90%. Using X&#8208;ray absorption, in situ Raman and Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopies, theoretical calculations, and post&#8208;ORR assessments, it is found that this hollow compound possesses intrinsic open channels and is characterized by the optimal metal atomic spacing, and exceptional structural and compositional stabilities. These factors significantly enhance the thermodynamics, kinetics, and stability of the 2e&#8722; ORR process. Notably, the produced compound also exhibits outstanding 2e&#8722; ORR performance in neutral environments. Furthermore, this strategy can be extended to other hollow rare&#8208;earth&#8211;P&#8211;O compounds, demonstrating excellent 2e&#8722; ORR performance under both neutral and alkaline conditions.

         <title>Dynamic Redox Induced Localized Charge Accumulation Accelerating Proton Exchange Membrane Electrolysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Introducing capacitive Mn into IrO2 modulates the local electronic structure and adsorption behavior. Under applied bias, dynamic redox reactions induce localized charge accumulation, leading to significant pseudocapacitance and improved OER kinetics at the Ir sites. Furthermore, the higher energy for oxygen vacancy formation inhibits lattice oxygen activation, thereby improving stability.








Abstract
The sluggish anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in proton exchange membrane (PEM) electrolysis necessitates applied bias to facilitate electron transfer as well as bond cleavage and formation. Traditional electrocatalysis focuses on analyzing the effects of electron transfer, while the role of charge accumulation induced by the applied overpotential has not been thoroughly investigated. To explore the influence mechanism of bias&#8208;driven&#160;charge accumulation, capacitive Mn is incorporated into IrO2 to regulate the local electronic structure and the adsorption behavior. The applied bias triggers dynamic redox reactions at the active sites, which introduce local charge accumulation on the surface of electrocatalyst. Under bias, Mn oxidation induced a noticeable pseudocapacitance in the pre&#8208;OER region, promoting the OER kinetics of iridium sites. Meanwhile, the increased oxygen vacancy formation energy further prevents the lattice oxygen activation. The PEM electrolyzer, equipped with optimal materials as an anode, operates at a low driving voltage of 1.637&#160;V under 2.0 A cm&#8722;2, maintaining stable performance for over 800&#160;h with a low degradation rate (19.4 &#181;V h&#8722;1). This work provides insights into the performance of metal oxide catalysts in acidic environments and offers forward&#8208;looking strategies for enhancing the catalytic performance through dynamic redox induced capacitive behavior.

         <title>Rejuvenation Modulation of Nucleus Pulposus Progenitor Cells Reverses Senescence&#8208;Associated Intervertebral Disc Degeneration</title>

The declined regeneration potential of aging NPPCs fails to antagonize IVDD. The in&#8208;house&#8208;customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduce Klotho circRNA into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotypic and attune the balance of ECM synthesis/catabolism. Moreover, chemokine&#8208;scavenging hydrogel reservoir in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT&#8208;LNPs enlists the regenerative capacity of resident NPPCs and restoration of youthful structure and functional features to the IVD.








Abstract
The decreased regeneration potential of aging nucleus pulposus resident progenitor cells (NPPCs) fails to resist intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD), and strategies to remodel the regeneration capacity of senescent NPPC are urgently needed. A decrease in Klotho gene expression in NPPCs of both old mice and humans exacerbates the impaired regenerative functionality of NPPC. Here, an NPPC&#8208;targeted lipid thymine nanoparticle (NT&#8208;LNP) is reported for the in situ manipulation of the regenerative repair potential of NPPCs, restoration of degenerated nucleus pulposus tissue, and mitigation of IVDD. Specifically, the results showed that the in&#8208;house customized lipid nanoparticles efficiently introduced Klotho circular ribonucleic acid (circRNA) into NPPCs to engender a renascent phenotype and tuned the balance of extracellular matrix synthesis/catabolism in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, an intradiscal injectable hydrogel system that scavenges chemokines (MCP1 and IL8) in tandem with NPPCs rejuvenated NT&#8208;LNPs in the IVD, modulating the inflammatory environment and synergistically promoting the regeneration of degenerated intervertebral discs. In summary, the findings establish that NPPCs can be re&#8208;engineered to be youthful and pluripotent to maintain homeostasis and rejuvenation, thereby providing a reversible treatment strategy for IVDD with broad application in other senescence&#8208;related diseases.

         <title>Tunable Bicontinuous Macroporous Cell Culture Scaffolds via Kinetically Controlled Phase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Kinetic control of photopolymerization tunes pore size during the formation of macroporous hydrogel scaffolds via liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation. The fabrication process is cytocompatible for direct 3D cell culture within tunable macroporous biomaterials.








Abstract
3D scaffolds enable biological investigations with a more natural cell conformation. However, the porosity of synthetic hydrogels is often limited to the nanometer scale, which confines the movement of 3D encapsulated cells and restricts dynamic cell processes. Precise control of hydrogel porosity across length scales remains a challenge and the development of porous materials that allow cell infiltration, spreading, and migration in a manner more similar to natural ECM environments is desirable. Here, a straightforward and reliable method is presented for generating kinetically&#8208;controlled macroporous biomaterials using liquid&#8211;liquid phase separation between poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) and dextran. Photopolymerization&#8208;induced phase separation resulted in macroporous hydrogels with tunable pore size. Varying light intensity and hydrogel composition controlled polymerization kinetics, time to percolation, and complete gelation, which defined the average pore diameter (&#216; = 1&#8211;200 &#181;m) and final gel stiffness of the formed hydrogels. Critically, for biological applications, macroporous hydrogels are prepared from aqueous polymer solutions at physiological pH and temperature using visible light, allowing for direct cell encapsulation. Human dermal fibroblasts in a range of macroporous gels are encapsulated with different pore sizes. Porosity improved cell spreading with respect to bulk gels and allowed migration in the porous biomaterials.

         <title>Electro&#8208; and Photo&#8208; Dual Responsive Chromatic Devices for High&#8208;Contrast Dimmers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly transparent photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is developed, which not only serves as an electrolyte for zinc anode&#8208;based electrochromic devices but also provides a photochromic effect to reduce tinted transmittance. These dual&#8208;responsive dimmers address concerns about low transmittance contrast in electrochromic devices, representing a significant step forward for high&#8208;contrast dimming in dynamic windows and AR glasses.








Abstract
Electrochromism stands out as a highly promising technology for applications including variable optical attenuators, optical switches, transparent displays, and dynamic windows. The pursuit of high&#8208;contrast tunability in electrochromic devices remains a challenging goal. Here, the first photochromic hydrogel electrolyte is reported for electro&#8208; and photo&#8208;dual responsive chromatic devices that yield a high transmittance contrast at 633&#160;nm (&#916;T = 83.1%), along with a tinted transmittance below 1.5%. Such high&#8208;contrast devices not only hold great promise for dynamic windows but also enable seamless transitions between transparent augmented reality (AR) glass and opaque virtual reality (VR) glass. These findings introduce an innovative strategy for the design of high&#8208;contrast dimmers, opening new avenues for the development of chromatic devices.

         <title>Inorganic/Inorganic Composites Through Emulsion Templating</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The combination of emulsions, slip casting, and inorganic particle loaded suspensions forms a processing platform that allows the controlled fabrication of intricate inorganic/inorganic composites. This new platform can be used for example to produce strong and lightweight porous samples with pores coated by a conformal layer of a second material or tough fiber&#8208;reinforced composites.








Abstract
Inorganic/inorganic composites are found in multiple applications crucial for the energy transition, from nuclear reactors to energy storage devices. Their microstructures dictate their properties from mass transport to fracture resistance. Consequently, there has been a multitude of processes developed to control them, from powder mixing and the use of short or long fibers, to tape casting for laminates up to recent 3D printing. Here, emulsions and slip casting are combined into a simpler, broadly available, inexpensive processing platform that allows for in situ control of composite microstructure while also enabling complex 3D shaping. This study shows that slip casting of emulsions triggers a two&#8208;step solvent removal, opening the possibility for the conformal coating of pores. This process is showcased by producing strong and lightweight alumina scaffolds reinforced by a conformal zirconia coating. In addition, by manipulating magnetically responsive droplets, their distribution can be controlled, allowing for the formation of inorganic fibers inside an inorganic matrix in situ during slip casting. Using this approach, alumina has been reinforced with aligned metallic iron fibers to prepare composites with a work of fracture an order of magnitude higher than the pure ceramics.

         <title>Tailoring Acid&#8208;Salt Hybrid Electrolyte Structure for Stable Proton Storage at Ultralow Temperature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An anti&#8208;freezing acid&#8208;salt hybrid electrolyte with the stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O (Cl&#8722;&#8722;Zn2+&#8722;H2O) solvation structure is developed, which achieves unconventional proton transport through strong interactions between hydrophilic ions and H2O and improves cycling stability by avoiding severe structure destruction of &#945;&#8208;MoO3 anodes, resulting in providing a steady power supply for the VHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 proton storage device at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C.









Abstract
The critical challenges in developing ultralow&#8208;temperature proton&#8208;based energy storage systems are enhancing the diffusion kinetics of charge carriers and inhibiting water&#8208;triggered interfacial side reactions between electrolytes and electrodes. Here an acid&#8208;salt hybrid electrolyte with a stable anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O solvation structure that realizes unconventional proton transport at ultralow temperature is shown, which is crucial for electrodes and devices to achieve high rate&#8208;capacity and stable interface compatibility with electrodes. Through multiscale simulations and experimental investigations in the electrolyte employing ZnCl2 introduced into 0.2 M H2SO4 solution, it is discovered that unique anion&#8722;cation&#8722;H2O solvation structure endows the electrolyte with low&#8208;temperature&#8208;adaptive feature and favorable water network channels for rapid proton transport. In situ XRD and multiple spectroscopic techniques further reveal that the stable 3D network structure inhibits free water&#8208;triggered deleterious electrode structure distortion by immobilizing free water molecules to achieve outstanding cycling stability. Hence, VHCF//&#945;&#8208;MoO3 hybrid proton capacitors deliver an unexpected capacity of 39.8 mAh g&#8722;1 at a high current density of 1 A g&#8722;1 (&#8722;80&#160;&#176;C) and steady power supply under ultralow temperatures (96% capacity retention after 1500 cycles at &#8722;80&#160;&#176;C). The anti&#8208;freezing hybrid electrolyte design provides an effective strategy to improve the application of energy storage devices in ultralow temperatures.

         <title>Selective Recycling of Mixed Polyesters via Heterogeneous Photothermal Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The advent of heterogenous photothermal catalysis technology for the selective upcycling of mixed plastics represents a revolutionary breakthrough amidst the resolving global crisis of plastic pollution. This transformative technology not only addresses the inefficiencies and exorbitant costs associated with conventional plastic recycling methods but also heralds a profound impact on the realms of energy and environmental science.








Abstract
The selective recycling of mixed plastic wastes with similar structural units is challenging. While heterogeneous catalysis shows potential for selective recycling, challenges such as complex mass transfer at multiphase interfaces and unclear catalytic mechanisms have slowed progress. In this study, a breakthrough in recycling mixed polyester wastes is introduced using heterogeneous photothermal catalysis. By adding co&#8208;solvents, the difficulties associated with multiphase interfacial mass transfer are overcome. Grain boundary (GB)&#8208;rich CeO2 photothermal catalysts are used to selectively glycolyze mixed poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET) and poly(bisphenol A carbonate) (PC) plastics into bisphenol A (BPA) and bis(2&#8208;hydroxyethyl) terephthalate (BHET), achieving yields of 97.8% and 93.4%, respectively. The high concentration of oxygen vacancies in GB&#8208;rich CeO2 catalysts adjusts the adsorption energy of intermediates, leading to more selective and efficient depolymerization compared to GB&#8208;poor CeO2 catalysts. The economic and environmental analysis demonstrates that this process, which utilizes heterogeneous photothermal catalysis, provides significant energy savings and carbon reduction, representing a major advancement in mixed plastic waste recycling.

         <title>Permanent Electride Magnets Induced by Quasi&#8208;Atomic Non&#8208;Nucleus&#8208;Bound Electrons</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The interstitial quasi&#8208;atomic electrons (IQE) located in cationic cavities have driven diverse magnetic phases by inherited magnetic properties. This reports, the IQEs first carry the permanent magnet via spin&#8208;orbit coupling (SOC) with rare&#8208;earth cations in the ferrite&#8208;like magnetic structure 2D electride [Re2C]2+2e&#8722;. This finding suggests a platform for exploring the relationship between SOC and coercivity using the smallest magnetic particles.








Abstract
Interstitial quasi&#8208;atomic electrons (IQEs) in the quantized energy levels of positively charged cavities possess a substantial own magnetic moment and control the magnetism of crystalline electrides depending on the interaction with surrounding cations. However, weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling and gentle exchange interaction restricted by the IQEs preclude a large magnetic anisotropic, remaining a challenge for a hard magnetism. It is reported that 2D [Re2C]2+&#183;2e&#8722; electrides (Re = Er, Ho, Dy, and Tb) show the permanent magnetism in a ferrimagnetic ground state, mimicking the ferrites composed of magnetic sublattices with different spin polarizations. Magnetic interaction between Re&#8208;spin lattice and IQE&#8208;spin lattice in the [Re2C]2+&#183;2e&#8722; electrides results in a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and high coercivity, giving a maximum energy product of 15 MGOe. It is demonstrated that the spontaneous breaking of magnetic IQE&#8208;sublattice through substitution with paramagnetic elements produces a crossover into an antiferromagnetic spin ordering of Re&#8208;sublattice, implying that the magnetic sublattice of IQEs drives the permanent magnetism.

&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interstitial quasi-atomic electrons (IQEs) in the quantized energy levels of positively charged cavities possess a substantial own magnetic moment and control the magnetism of crystalline electrides depending on the interaction with surrounding cations. However, weak spin-orbit coupling and gentle exchange interaction restricted by the IQEs preclude a large magnetic anisotropic, remaining a challenge for a hard magnetism. It is reported that 2D [&lt;i&gt;Re&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; electrides (Re = Er, Ho, Dy, and Tb) show the permanent magnetism in a ferrimagnetic ground state, mimicking the ferrites composed of magnetic sublattices with different spin polarizations. Magnetic interaction between Re-spin lattice and IQE-spin lattice in the [&lt;i&gt;Re&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;&#183;2e&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt; electrides results in a large magnetocrystalline anisotropy and high coercivity, giving a maximum energy product of 15 MGOe. It is demonstrated that the spontaneous breaking of magnetic IQE-sublattice through substitution with paramagnetic elements produces a crossover into an antiferromagnetic spin ordering of Re-sublattice, implying that the magnetic sublattice of IQEs drives the permanent magnetism.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Slide&#8208;Ring Structured Stress&#8208;Electric Coupling Hydrogel Microspheres for Low&#8208;Loss Transduction Between Tissues</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stress&#8208;electric coupling hydrogel microsphere is developed to restore low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues. The synergistic effects of the molecular slippage mechanism of slide&#8208;ring structure, the conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron movement of polypyrrole, and the piezoelectric properties of barium titanate minimize the energy loss during electromechanical conversion between tissues, enhance chondrogenic differentiation of stem cells and remodel inflammatory microenvironment, thereby promoting osteoarthritis treatment.








Abstract
High transductive loss at tissue injury sites impedes repair. The high dissipation characteristics in the electromechanical conversion of piezoelectric biomaterials pose a challenge. Therefore, supramolecular engineering and microfluidic technology is utilized to introduce slide&#8208;ring polyrotaxane and conductive polypyrrole to construct stress&#8208;electric coupling hydrogel microspheres. The molecular slippage mechanism of slide&#8208;ring structure stores and releases mechanical energy, reducing mechanical loss, the piezoelectric barium titanate enables stress&#8208;electricity conversion, and conjugated &#960;&#8208;electron movement in conductive network improves the internal electron transfer efficiency of microspheres, thereby reducing the loss in stress&#8208;electricity conversion for the first time. Compared to traditional piezoelectric hydrogel microspheres, the stress&#8208;electric coupling efficiency of low&#8208;dissipation microspheres increased by 2.3 times, and the energy dissipation decreased to 43%. At cellular level, electrical signals generated by the microspheres triggered Ca2+ influx into stem cells and upregulated the cAMP signaling pathways, promoting chondrogenic differentiation. Enhanced electrical signals induced macrophage polarization to the M2 phenotype, reshaping inflammation and promoting tissue repair. In vivo, the low&#8208;dissipation microspheres restored low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues, alleviated cartilage damage, improved behavioral outcomes, and promoted the treatment of osteoarthritis in rats. Therefore, this study proposes a new strategy for restoring low&#8208;loss transduction between tissues, particularly in mechanically sensitive tissues.

         <title>An Adaptable Structure of Metal&#8208;Organic Framework Glass Interlayer Enables Superior Performance in Aqueous Zinc&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) glass, i.e., Zn&#8208;ZIF62 glass, is used to overcome the inadequate structural stability and rapid failure of the Zn&#8208;ZIF62 crystal. When prepared as an artificial interlayer on the Zn metal anode, the heightened configuration freedom of MOF glass endows the stress&#8208;resisted ion transport and the extended Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway, thus achieving high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
The practical application of safe and cost&#8208;effective aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries is enhanced by the metal&#8208;organic frameworks (MOFs), which possess tunable porous structures and chemical compositions that can facilitate the desolvation and transport of Zn2+ ions at the anode interface. However, ensuring the structural stability and operational life of crystalline MOFs in batteries remains a challenge. Here, a breakthrough is presented in tackling this dilemma. A MOF glass interlayer, specifically the ZIF&#8208;62 glass interlayer, is designed and fabricated for the Zn anode. The integration of this interlayer endows the Zn anode with a remarkable cyclic lifespan. It also achieves outstanding cyclability in Zn||MnO2 full&#8208;cell with limited Zn excess, showing no capacity decay after 600 cycles at 0.5 A g&#8722;1, and in a Zn||iodine pouch battery with a mass loading of 12.85&#160;mg cm&#8722;2. This superior cyclicity is attributed to the ease of distortion of Zn[ligand]4 tetrahedra and the reduced likelihood of disconnection between adjacent tetrahedra within the glass interlayer, as compared to its crystalline counterpart. The unique structure of ZIF&#8208;62 glass provides an increased degree of configurational freedom, allowing it to withstand mechanical stress and extend the Zn2+ ion diffusion pathway. This ensures high cycling stability and rapid interfacial diffusion kinetics.

         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper explores ultra&#8208;flexible silicon nanomembrane synaptic transistors on polyethylene terephthalate substrates, which maintain stable electrical performance after 10&#160;000 bending cycles at a 2.2 mm curvature radius. These devices effectively emulate synaptic functions with high linearity, achieving 93.2% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, underscoring their suitability for flexible neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
The increasing demand for mobile artificial intelligence applications has elevated edge computing to a prominent research area. Silicon materials, renowned for their excellent electrical properties, are extensively utilized in traditional electronic devices. However, the development of silicon materials for flexible neuromorphic computing devices encounters great challenges. To address these limitations, ultrasoft silicon nanomembranes have emerged as a focal point due to their capability to preserve the superior electrical properties of silicon while providing substantial mechanical flexibility and interfacial tunability. Despite these advantages, difficulties remain in the transfer process of silicon nanomembranes and their integration for flexible synaptic transistors. In this work, an organic&#8211;inorganic hybrid polyimide&#8208;Al2O3 dielectric layer has been designed for synaptic behavior grown by an atomic layer deposition process, and integrated with a silicon nanomembrane to realize highly flexible synaptic transistors. These transistors demonstrate stable electrical performance even after undergoing 10&#160;000 bending cycles at an extreme curvature radius of 2.2&#160;mm. Furthermore, the silicon nanomembrane transistors effectively emulate synaptic functions, exhibiting exceptional linearity in their long&#8208;term characteristics, making them suitable for the application scenarios of detecting subtle signals. When applied to handwritten digit recognition simulations, these synaptic transistors have achieved a high accuracy rate of 93.2%.

         <title>Multifunctional Quasi&#8208;Homogeneous Catalysts as a New Catalytic Strategy to Boost the Performance of Li&#8208;O2 Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multifunctional quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalyst strategy with Ru&#8208;loaded amino&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) well&#8208;dispersed in the electrolyte is developed. Together with the ability to facilitate Li2O2 formation and decomposition, modify electrolytes, and protect Li metal anode, RuApCPDs render Li&#8208;O2 batteries with comprehensively improved performance, offering brand&#8208;new catalyst design strategies for Li&#8208;O2 batteries.








Abstract
Li&#8208;O2 batteries have been considered as a kind of prospective next&#8208;generation batteries due to their ultrahigh energy densities. However, limited capacities, high charge overpotentials, and short lifetime are troubling obstacles for realizing their real&#8208;world implementation. Common strategies, including introducing solid&#8208;state catalysts (SSCs) and redox mediators (RMs), are insufficient to solve these issues. Herein, Ru&#8208;loaded amino&#8208;phenanthroline&#8208;based carbonized polymer dots (RuApCPDs) integrating the catalytic activity of SSCs with the mobility of RMs have been designed to behave as quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalysts in the electrolyte. Their mobile nature can ensure the avoidance of complete coverage of active sites, and the catalytic ability decreases the charge overpotential through co&#8208;deposition with the discharge products. Additionally, the RuApCPDs can also adjust the Li+ solvation structure and well protect the Li metal anodes with high stability. As a result, the introduction of RuApCPDs leads to a fivefold increase in discharge capacity, a low charge voltage of 3.75 V, and a running life of 168 cycles (79 cycles without RuApCPDs). The multifunctional quasi&#8208;homogeneous catalyst developed here demonstrates its advantageous potential as a new catalytic strategy for bringing Li&#8208;O2 batteries to become a viable technology.

The multifunctional quasi-homogeneous catalyst developed here demonstrates its advantageous potential as a new catalytic strategy for bringing Li-O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; batteries to become a viable technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Toward Fast&#8208;Charging and Dendritic&#8208;Free Li Growth on Natural Graphite Through Intercalation/Conversion on MoS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) anodes improves fast&#8208;charging capability and cycling performance in lithium&#8208;ion batteries. The MoS2&#8208;NG anode reduces charging time and interfacial resistance by modifying the SEI layer, achieving an 80% state of charge in 14.7 minutes, making it ideal for electric vehicles.








Abstract
During fast&#8208;charging, uneven lithium plating on the surface of commercial graphite anode impedes the electrochemical performance of lithium&#8208;ion batteries, causing a safety issue. The formation of a passivation layer, the solid&#8208;electrolyte interphase (SEI), due to side reactions with the organic electrolyte, correlates with long&#8208;term cycling performance under fast&#8208;charging conditions, necessitating comprehensive analysis. Herein, it is demonstrated that a molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) coating on natural graphite (NG) modulates the properties of the SEI layer, enabling reduction of the charging time and the enhancement of long&#8208;term cycling performance. MoS2 spontaneously transforms into Li2S and Mo nanoclusters through intercalation and conversion with Li+, altering the chemical composition and stability of the SEI layer on the NG, promoting faster Li+ transport, and reducing interfacial resistance. The MoS2&#8208;NG anode shows improved fast&#8208;charging capability and cycling performance under 3.0 C&#8208;charging and 1.0 C&#8208;discharging over 300 cycles without compromising energy density. In the full&#8208;cell configuration, a charging time of 14.7 min at 80% state of charge is achieved, making it suitable for electric vehicle applications.

         <title>Creating Single&#8208;Crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 for High&#8208;Performance Electronic Packaging Substrate</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Aluminum doping strategy is used to form less aggregated structural domains, creating a favorable environment for the precipitation of nanoscale polycrystalline CaSiO3. Through the process of anomalous grain growth, the nanoscale &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals are fully absorbed, rearranged, and transformed into micrometer&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3. The highly ordered layered structure of &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 provides efficient pathways for ion and electron transport, reducing its dielectric constant, while the single&#8208;crystalline structure enhances the mechanical properties of the electronic substrate.








Abstract
&#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 based glass&#8208;ceramics are among the most reliable materials for electronic packaging. However, developing a CaSiO3 glass&#8208;ceramic substrate with both high strength (&gt;230&#160;MPa) and low dielectric constant (&lt;5) remains challenging due to its polycrystalline nature. The present work has succeeded in synthesizing single&#8208;crystalline &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 for a high&#8208;performance glass&#8208;ceramic substrate. This is accomplished by introducing Al3+ into the CaO&#8208;B2O3&#8208;SiO2 glass system, and by optimizing the sintering condition. Al3+ doping facilitates a heterogeneous network structure that energetically favors the precipitation of polycrystalline particles, including nanosized &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals and sub&#8208;nanosized &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals. As the sintering temperature increases, the nano &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals (2&#8211;10&#160;nm) are gradually absorbed by the &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals. Through atomic rearrangement, &#945;&#8208;CaSiO3 crystals transform into micrometer&#8208;sized single crystal &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 (1&#8211;2&#160;&#181;m) with layered structure. The low temperature co&#8208;fired &#946;&#8208;CaSiO3 glass&#8208;ceramics exhibit exceptional properties, including a low dielectric constant of 4.04, a low dielectric loss of 3.15 &#215; 10&#8722;3 at 15&#160;GHz, and a high flexural strength of 256&#160;MPa. This work provides a new strategy for fabricating high&#8208;performance single&#8208;crystalline glass&#8208;ceramics for electronic packaging and other applications.

         <title>Light&#8208;Triggered Reversible Assembly of Halide Perovskite Nanoplatelets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work demonstrates sunlight&#8208;triggered perpetual flipping of halide perovskite nanoplatelets between stacked and scattered configurations, under light and dark, respectively. The photo&#8208;switchable mechanical response is driven by sulfide linkage dynamics and accompanied by a brown&#8208;to&#8208;red color change. The switchable control over electric current and reversible topographical oscillations offers possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.








Abstract
Advancements in stimuli&#8208;driven nanoactuators necessitate the discovery of photo&#8208;switchable, self&#8208;contained semiconductor nanostructures capable of precise mechanical responses. The reversible assembly of 0D Cs3Bi2I9 halide perovskite nanoplatelets (NPLs) between stacked and scattered configurations are demonstrated under light and dark, respectively. This sunlight&#8208;triggered perpetual flipping of the NPLs, occurring in less than a minute, is associated with a color change between brown and red. The photomechanical response is driven by the formation and cleavage of sulfide linkages at the NPL surface. In the stacked configuration, various stacking modes create moir&#233; superstructures, enhancing the interlayer charge distribution, and increasing the electronic conductivity and optical absorbance. This leads to a decrease in exciton binding energy from 247 meV for scattered NPLs to 162 meV for stacked NPLs, resulting in a 3.5&#8208;fold enhancement in dark current for the stacked NPL films. The switchable control over color and electric current is continuously reversible and retraceable, exhibiting a minor memory effect observed during extended cycling. The self&#8208;flipping NPL nanoactuators demonstrate reversible mechanical responses, with topographical oscillations ranging from 14 nm in scattered NPLs to 50 nm in the vertically stacked configuration. This seamless reversible nano&#8208;assembly with color interchangeability offers numerous possibilities for nanorobotics, nanoscale switches, and sensors.

         <title>Directional Chiral Exciton Emission via Topological Polarization Singularities in all Van der Waals Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low&#8208;symmetry metasurfaces directly patterned in WS2 thin film engender topological polarization singularities in the momentum space, which strongly interact with the exciton emission from the heterogeneously integrated monolayer MoSe2. Consequently, exciton emission with controllable chirality and directionality is achieved by combining both strong exciton emission and optical field manipulation in all van der Waals metasurfaces fully based on 2D materials.








Abstract
Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with strong exciton effects have enabled diverse light emitting devices, however, their &#197;ngstrom thickness makes it challenging to efficiently manipulate exciton emission by themselves. Although their nanostructured multi&#8208;layer counterparts can effectively manipulate optical field at deep subwavelength thickness scale, these indirect band gap multi&#8208;layer TMDs are lack of strong luminescence, hindering their applications in light emitting devices. Here, the integration of monolayer TMDs is presented with nanostructured multi&#8208;layer TMDs, combining both strong exciton emission and optical manipulation in a single ultra&#8208;thin platform. Leveraging the topological polarization singularities in the all van der Waals metasurfaces, chiral exciton emission is experimentally demonstrated whose directionality can be controlled by tailoring metasurface's symmetry. These results provide an approach that can realize exciton emitting devices fully based on 2D materials with controllable polarization and directionality, and may unfold a new avenue for multi&#8208;functional 2D semiconductor light sources.

         <title>Voltage&#8208;Induced Bromide Redox Enables Capacity Restoration of Fast&#8208;Charging Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>

The bromide (Br&#8722;/Br3&#8722;) redox couple is successfully activated and maximized in 2 mm lithium bromide containing electrolyte via voltage control strategy to function as de&#8208;passivaion reagent to react with Li2O and wrapped Li0 species, which provide more accessible Li+ ions and restore the decayed capacity of fast&#8208;charging LiFePO4||Graphite cells.








Abstract
Fast&#8208;charging lithium&#8208;ion batteries (LIBs) are essential for electric vehicles (EVs) to compete with conventional gasoline ones in terms of charging viability, yet the aggressive capacity drop in fast&#8208;charging scenarios gives rise to concerns regarding durability and sustainability. Herein, it is clarified that for fast&#8208;charging batteries, the excessive lithium (Li) plating on graphite anode inevitably brings capacity fading, and the concurrent accumulation of Li2O&#8208;dominant passivation species that form dead Li is the main reason for their poor rechargeability. To refresh the passivated graphite, a voltage&#8208;induced activation mechanism is developed to leverage bromide (Br&#8722;/Br3&#8722;) redox couple for Li2O and isolated Li0 activation in situ. Along with a tiny amount of lithium bromide (LiBr) added into the&#160;electrolyte, the cut&#8208;off voltage of activation processes is controlled to initiate and maximize the effectiveness of Br&#8722;/Br3&#8722; redox couple. The capacity of degraded fast&#8208;charging cells can increase from lower than 30 to &#8776;118 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1 before and after the activation, respectively. Notably, the process is not one&#8208;off; a subsequent activation is feasible. For the same battery that suffered from another round of fast charging, this design still restores the reversible capacity to &#8776;100 mAh&#160;g&#8722;1. Such a voltage&#8208;mediated mechanism can effectively prolong the service life of practical fast&#8208;charging batteries.

         <dc:description>
A COF&#8208;based biomimetic artificial photosynthesis system integrates ATP synthase and a light&#8208;responsive photoacid to generate a proton gradient driving ATP production. The system demonstrates regenerative ATP synthesis through repeated light on/off cycles, enabling the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides and showcasing a sustainable approach for converting solar energy into chemical energy.








Abstract
Biomimetic photosynthesis, which leverages nanomaterials with light&#8208;responsive capabilities, represents an innovative approach for replicating natural photosynthetic processes for green and sustainable energy conversion. In this study, a covalent&#8208;organic framework (COF)&#8208;based artificial photosynthesis system is realized through the co&#8208;assembly of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) synthase and a light&#8208;responsive proton generator onto an imine&#8208;based COF, RT&#8208;COF&#8208;1. This system demonstrates an ATP production rate of 0.64 &#181;mol ATP per mg protein within 90 s of light exposure and, for the first time, exhibites regenerative ATP production through multiple light on/off cycles. Furthermore, the ATP generated by the system facilitates the biocoupling of monosaccharides into disaccharides, confirming the hybrid system's capability to convert solar energy into chemical energy in the form of organic molecules. This approach shows significant potential for renewable bioenergy generation, offering precise and reliable control over biochemical processes through artificial photosynthesis.

         <title>Self&#8208;Wrinkling&#8208;Induced Mechanically Adaptive Patterned Surface of Photocuring Coating for Abrasion Resistance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unravels a self&#8208;wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) by a one&#8208;step UV&#8208;curing and self&#8208;wrinkling technique. Thanks to the mechanically adaptive performance of the bionic wrinkled microstructure, the SWMAPS with both random and programmable&#8208;irradiated wrinkles can withstand more than 600 cycles of reciprocating friction, which establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surface for mechanical enhancement.








Abstract
Providing mechanically adaptive performance to surfaces is significant in preserving materials from damage in variable environments, however, it has rarely been studied. Inspired by the mechanically adaptive behaviors of the surface microstructure on the carapace of desert scorpions and bark of desert tamarisks, a self&#8208;wrinkled mechanically adaptive patterned surface (SWMAPS) using one&#8208;step UV&#8208;curing and self&#8208;wrinkling technique is reported. Because of the fluorinated polyurethane photo&#8208;initiator formed by self&#8208;assembly at the top surface, UV&#8208;induced photo&#8208;crosslinking can spontaneously generate a gradient&#8208;crosslinked structure and wrinkled patterns with different morphology. With mechanically adaptive behavior originating from self&#8208;assembled fluorinated polyurethane photo&#8208;initiators, gradient&#8208;crosslinked structures, and self&#8208;wrinkled patterns, the SWMAPS remains intact under 600 cycles of reciprocating friction with little variation in the coefficient of friction and water contact angle. The SWMAPS prepared by programmable UV irradiation maintains integral under 1800 cycles of reciprocating friction with a stable friction coefficient. Furthermore, the SWMAPS is fabricated with high efficiency, regulated morphology, good surface mechanical properties, and self&#8208;recovery performance. This strategy establishes a new field of mechanically adaptive patterned surfaces, which significantly improves durability and prolongs the service life of materials in variable environments.

         <title>Successive Reactions of Trimethylgermanium Chloride to Achieve &gt; 26% Efficiency MA&#8208;Free Perovskite Solar Cell With 3000&#8208;Hour Unattenuated Operation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) is introduced into the perovskite precursor solution. Comprehensive experiments find that TGC triggers the successive interactions involving the hydrolysis of Ge&#9472;Cl bond forming Ge&#9472;OH group, then forming O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N/O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I bonds. Benefiting from these successive interactions, the TGC&#8208;treated device realizes a PCE of 26.03% and 26.38% for the conventional (n&#8208;i&#8208;p) and inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) FACsPbI3 PSCs with 3000 h unattenuated operation.








Abstract
The rapidly increased efficiency of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) indicates their broad commercial prospects, but the commercialization of perovskite faces complex optimization processes and stability issues. In this work, a simple optimized strategy is developed by the addition of trimethylgermanium chloride (TGC) into FACsPbI3 precursor solution. TGC triggers the successive interactions in perovskite solution and film, involving the hydrolysis of vulnerable Ge&#9472;Cl bond forming Ge&#9472;OH group, then forming the hydrogen bonds (O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;N and O&#9472;H&#183;&#183;&#183;I) with FAI. These successive interactions effectively safeguard FA+ from decomposition, accelerate crystallization, restrict ion migration, and passivate film defects. Thus, a high&#8208;quality perovskite is obtained with the super&#8208;hydrophobic surface, maintaining the light&#8208;active phase (&#945;&#8208;phase) even after exposure to high&#8208;humidity air (RH: 85%) for 10 days. Consequently, the TGC&#8208;treated conventional (n&#8208;i&#8208;p) and inverted (p&#8208;i&#8208;n) FACsPbI3 PSCs achieve 26.03%&#8208; and 26.38%&#8208; efficiencies, respectively, retaining unattenuated operation initial efficiency after tracking at the maximum power point (MPP) under illumination for 3000&#160;h.

         <title>Anti&#8208;Fatigue Cellular Graphene Aerogel Through Multiscale Joint Strengthening</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, and multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed to improve fatigue performance of CGA.








Abstract
Despite fatigue free of monolayer graphene, its assemblies, like cellular graphene aerogels (CGA), are usually suffering of frequent fatigue and inherent strength degradation in repeated loading. In this work, by employing multiscale modeling, the highly intrinsic anisotropic mechanical properties of the cell wall due to the layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer stacked graphene sheets are uncovered, which easily trigger the unique skeleton joints damage during repeated loading and contribute the primary fatigue mechanism of CGA. Conversely, multiscale joint strengthening strategies are proposed by interlayer crosslinking and joint curvation, improving the interlayer interaction, and decreasing interlayer stress during compression, respectively, so as to effectively suppress joint damage to improve fatigue performance of CGA. This work not only clarifies the underlying fatigue mechanism of 2D cellular materials but also highlights optimal design strategies for developing anti&#8208;fatigue graphene cellular structures.

         <title>Precise Cell Type Electrical Stimulation Therapy Via Force&#8208;electric Hydrogel Microspheres for Cartilage Healing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrated that injectable force&#8208;electric hydrogel microspheres generate sustained electrical stimulation under pressure, actively inducing the aggregation of specific cell types. At the microscale, this process facilitates precise regulation of calcium ion influx, guiding the differentiation fate of targeted cells. Overall, this piezoelectric hydrogel offers a novel method for the precise repair of cartilage injuries.








Abstract
Electrical stimulation enhances cellular activity, promoting tissue regeneration and repair. However, specific cells and maintaining a stable energy supply are challenges for precise cell electrical stimulation therapy. Here, force&#8208;electric conversion hydrogel microspheres (Piezo@CR MPs) is devloped to induce specific stem cell aggregation and promote chondrogenic differentiation through localized electrical stimulation. These MPs contain barium titanate (BT) nanoparticles embedded in hyaluronic acid methacrylate hydrogel MPs, with a polydopamine (pDA) coating bound to stem cell recruitment peptides (CR) via &#960;&#8208;&#960; conjugation and electrostatic forces. Piezo@CR MPs convert pressure (ultrasound) into electrical stimulation, directing BMSCs for colonization and chondrogenesis. In vitro, directionally migrated stem cells almost covered the Piezo@CR MP surface, generating up to 451&#160;mV of electrical output that enhanced chondrogenic differentiation. In a rabbit osteochondral defect model, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration, nearly resembling native cartilage. In a rat osteoarthritis model, they reduced cartilage degeneration and improved behavioral outcomes. Additionally, Piezo@CR MPs promoted cartilage regeneration by driving the influx of extracellular calcium and activating the p38 mitogen&#8208;activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. In conclusion, Piezo@CR MPs offer a new approach for precise cell type electrical stimulation therapy in treating of cartilage injuries and degeneration.

         <title>Self&#8208;Poled Bismuth Ferrite Thin Film Micromachined for Piezoelectric Ultrasound Transducers</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A compositionally downgraded BiFeO3 is developed to produce enhanced self&#8208;poling by introducing compressive strain. Utilizing this large&#8208;area film over a 6&#8208;inch wafer, pMUTs with 6 &#215; 6 arrays at the device level are designed and micromanufactured. pMUT demonstrates sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a low frequency of 500 Hz and a high temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C.








Abstract
Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasound transducers (pMUTs), especially those using lead&#8208;free materials, are crucial next&#8208;generation microdevices for precise actuation and sensing, driving advancements in medical, industrial, and environmental applications. Bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3) is emerging as a promising lead&#8208;free piezoelectric material to replace Pb(Zr,Ti)O3 in pMUTs. Despite its potential, the integration of BiFeO3 thin films into pMUTs has been hindered by poling issues. Here, a BiFeO3 heterostructure compositionally downgraded with Gd doping is developed to introduce compressive strain, resulting in strong self&#8208;poling. Utilizing a large&#8208;area self&#8208;poled thin film over an entire 6&#8208;inch wafer, a pMUT with a 6 &#215; 6 array at the device level is designed and evaluated. At a resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the dynamic vibration displacement can reach 24.0 nm. At 500 Hz, far below the resonant frequency of 21 kHz, the pMUT also displays sensitive converse piezoelectric response, even at a high temperature of 200&#160;&#176;C. This work represents a significant breakthrough in lead&#8208;free BiFeO3 thin film for practical sensing applications, paving the way for the transformation of macro&#8208;transducers into next&#8208;generation functional microdevices.

         <title>Antifouling Immunomodulatory Copolymer Architectures That Inhibit the Fibrosis of Implants</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Novel copolymer coatings dramatically reduce the formation of fibrotic tissue on medical implants, extending device longevity. In vivo screening reveals that optimizing copolymer architecture is critical for synergizing state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art antifouling and immunomodulatory antifibrotic moieties.








Abstract
Immune reactions to medical implants often lead to encapsulation by fibrotic tissue and impaired device function. This process is thought to initiate by protein adsorption, which enables immune cells to attach and mount an inflammatory response. Previously, several antifibrotic materials have been either designed to reduce protein adsorption or discovered via high&#8208;throughput screens (HTS) to favorably regulate inflammation. The present work introduces antifouling immunomodulatory (AIM) copolymer coatings, which combine both strategies to effectively enhance&#160;implant protection. AIM copolymers synergistically integrate zwitterionic moieties to resist protein fouling, HTS&#8208;derived antifibrotics for immunomodulation, and silane monomers for grafting to diverse substrates including elastomers, ceramics, and metals. Interestingly, simply combining these monomers into conventional random or block copolymer architectures yielded no significant advantage over homopolymers. By contrast, an unusual polymer chain architecture &#8212; a zwitterionic block flanked by a mixed zwitterionic immunomodulatory segment &#8212; showed superior fibrosis resistance in both peritoneal and subcutaneous sites over one month in immunocompetent mice. This architecture also improved the performance of two different HTS&#8208;derived antifibrotic monomers, suggesting that tailoring AIM architectures may broadly complement immunomodulatory chemistries and provide a versatile approach to improving implant longevity.

         <title>Soft, Modular Power for Composing Robots with Embodied Energy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A worm&#8208;like robot composed of modular, self&#8208;contained actuators is developed. The modules with embodied zinc&#8208;iodide redox flow batteries are fabricated using a novel bonding method, allowing for reliable power supply over extended periods more than 35 h. Each module operates independently to create various gait patterns, demonstrating efficient locomotion.








Abstract
The adaptable, modular structure of muscles, combined with their confluent energy storage allows for numerous architectures found in nature: trunks, tongues, and tentacles to name some more complex ones. To provide an artificial analog to this biological soft muscle, a self&#8208;powered, soft hydrostat actuator is presented. As an example of how to use these modules, a worm robot is assembled where the near totality of the body stores electrochemical potential. The robot exhibits an extremely high system energy density (51.3 J g&#8722;1), using a redox flow battery motif, with a long theoretical operational range of more than 100 m on a single charge. The innovation lies in the battery pouch, fabricated with a dry&#8208;adhesion method, automatically bonding Nafion separators to a silicone&#8208;urethane copolymer body. These pouches contain anolyte within a hydrostat pod filled with catholyte, increasing current density per pod. Each pod has a motor and tendon actuator for radial compression and expansion. By linking these self&#8208;contained pods in series, the robot worm is created that automatically navigates an enclosed, curved path. This high&#8208;capacity soft worm also climbs up and down a vertical pipe, using a two&#8208;anchor crawling gait, with an extra payload equivalent to 1.5 times its body weight.

&lt;p&gt;The adaptable, modular structure of muscles, combined with their confluent energy storage allows for numerous architectures found in nature: trunks, tongues, and tentacles to name some more complex ones. To provide an artificial analog to this biological soft muscle, a self-powered, soft hydrostat actuator is presented. As an example of how to use these modules, a worm robot is assembled where the near totality of the body stores electrochemical potential. The robot exhibits an extremely high system energy density (51.3 J g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;), using a redox flow battery motif, with a long theoretical operational range of more than 100 m on a single charge. The innovation lies in the battery pouch, fabricated with a dry-adhesion method, automatically bonding Nafion separators to a silicone-urethane copolymer body. These pouches contain anolyte within a hydrostat pod filled with catholyte, increasing current density per pod. Each pod has a motor and tendon actuator for radial compression and expansion. By linking these self-contained pods in series, the robot worm is created that automatically navigates an enclosed, curved path. This high-capacity soft worm also climbs up and down a vertical pipe, using a two-anchor crawling gait, with an extra payload equivalent to 1.5 times its body weight.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>An Efficient Biosynthetic System for Developing Functional Silk Fibroin&#8208;Based Biomaterials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study reports a novel silk gland biosynthetic system for efficient expression and large&#8208;scale production of exogenous protein with bioactivity in silk fibers of transgenic silkworms, realizing cost&#8208;effective fabrications of fluorescent and antibacterial silk fibroin biomaterials, and providing an opportunity for genetic functionalization of silk fibroin to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.








Abstract
Long historical evolution and domestication endow silkworms with the super ability to synthesize and secrete massive silk proteins using silk glands. The major component of this secretion consists of silk fibroin, considered a promising biomaterial for tissue repairs and engineering. To further expand the utility of this unique protein, there is a continuing need for silk fibroin functionalization. Here, a highly&#8208;efficient Fib&#8208;HEXP biosynthetic system is established to synthesize massive recombinant RFP in silk fibers using transgenic silkworms, which accounts for &#8776;7.86% of silk mass and achieves fabrication of fluorescent silk fibroin (SF) biomaterials. The universality of the Fib&#8208;HEXP system is validated by genetic engineering glucose oxidase (GOx) functionalized silk fibers for fabricating GOx&#8208;SF hydrogels with antimicrobial activity to promote healing of infected diabetic wounds in mouse through the enzyme&#8208;catalyzed reaction of glucose to gluconic acid and H2O2. These findings demonstrate that the Fib&#8208;HEXP system provides an opportunity for genetic functionalization of SF to broaden the utility of this biomaterial for a range of potential applications.

Transparent Al2O3&#8208;LaMgAl11O19: Mn2+ composite ceramic is fabricated via vacuum sintering, producing high&#8208;color&#8208;purity (95.4%) green emission with FWHM of 24 nm, as well as superior thermal and moisture and laser irradiation stability.

Abstract
Laser&#8208;driven projection displays face a critical challenge in developing laser&#8208;excitable and high&#8208;performance narrowband green emitters. Herein, new Al2O3&#8208;LaMgAl11O19: Mn2+ (Al2O3&#8208;LMA: Mn2+) transparent composite ceramics are reported via high&#8208;temperature vacuum sintering, which produces a high&#8208;color&#8208;purity (95.4%) green emission with full width at half maximum of 24&#160;nm and superior thermal and moisture and laser irradiation stability. These are attributed to low electron&#8208;phonon couple, weak crystal&#8208;field effect, an individual lattice location of Mn2+ activators in high structural rigid host, and the incorporation of a high&#8208;thermal&#8208;conductivity Al2O3 secondary phase. As a result, the composite ceramics are demonstrated as an attractive color converter with a high external quantum efficiency (38%) and absorption coefficient (53%), which ensures a luminous flux of 2012&#160;lm @40.0&#160;W, a luminous efficacy of 67.7&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1, and a green light conversion efficiency of 20.3% upon blue laser irradiation. This enables to construct a brand&#8208;new laser&#8208;driven prototype display with a record color gamut beyond Rec.2020 standard (100.8%), outperforming commercial YAG: Ce3+ and &#946;&#8208;SiAlON: Eu2+. This exploration in ultra&#8208;narrowband green luminescent materials is poised to accelerate the development of &#8220;ideal displays&#8221; for laser&#8208;driven projection display technology.

         <title>Realizing C&#8211;C Coupling via Accumulation of C1 Intermediates within Dual&#8208;Vacancy&#8208;Induced Dipole&#8208;Limited Domain Field to Propel Photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 Fuel</title>

This study addresses the challenges of photocatalytic CO2 reduction by introducing C, N dual&#8208;vacancy sites into ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4, forming a localized dipole&#8208;limited domain electric field (DLDF). This design enhances CO2 activation and promotes efficient C&#8211;C coupling, leading to high&#8208;yield photocatalytic production of C2H6. The DLDF effect significantly improves electron transferability and stabilizes intermediates, facilitating the multi&#8208;electron reduction processes.








Abstract
Photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value&#8208;added C2 fuels remains a tough challenge, mainly due to the insufficient concentration of photogenerated electrons for the instability of C1 intermediates, which often tend to desorb easily and disable to form C&#9472;C bonds. In this work, photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2H6 is successfully achieved by introducing adjacent C, N dual&#8208;vacancy sites within the heptazine rings of ultrathin g&#8208;C3N4, which results in the opening of two neighboring heptazine rings and forms a distinctive dipole&#8208;limited domain field (DLDF) structure. In situ X&#8208;ray photoelectron spectra and in situ fourier transform infrared spectra provide direct evidence of the rapid accumulation and transformation of C1 intermediates, especially CO* and CHO*, within the DLDF. Ab initio molecular dynamics further substantiates the role of DLDF in promoting C&#8211;C coupling between CO* and CHO*, through the analysis of interaction trajectories and energy changes of their central atoms, ultimately achieving a high yield of C2H6 up to 57.86&#160;&#181;mol&#160;g&#8722;1&#160;h&#8722;1. It is for the first time to propose the concept of DLDF for significant advancement in photoreduction of CO2&#8208;to&#8208;C2 fuel with the evident breakthrough to address the challenge of coupling carbon&#8208;containing intermediates between active sites, offering new insights for the design of C&#8211;C coupling sites in single&#8208;component photocatalysts.

         <title>Large Dipole Moment Enhanced CO2 Adsorption on Copper Surface: Achieving 68.9% Catalytic Ethylene Faradaic Efficiency at 1.0 A cm&#8722;2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>

Poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene), featured with a substantial dipole moment and abundant Lewis base amino groups, enhances the adsorption and boosts the reduction of carbon dioxide on Cu surface, yielding impressive ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% at 1 A cm&#8722;2.








Abstract
The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO2) into hydrocarbon products emerges as a pivotal sustainable strategy for carbon utilization. Cu&#8208;based catalysts are currently prioritized as the most effective means for this process, yet it remains a long&#8208;term goal to achieve high product selectivity at elevated current densities. This study delved into exploring the influence of a topological poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene) with a substantial dipole moment on modulating the Cu surface dipole field to augment the catalytic activity involved in CO2 reduction. The resulting Cu/poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene) heterojunction showcases a remarkable ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% even at a substantial current density of 1 A cm&#8722;2. Through in situ Raman and in situ Fourier&#8208;transform infrared spectroscopy, poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene)&#8208;modified Cu electrode exhibits a heightened concentration of intermediates as compared to the bare Cu, proving advantageous for C&#8722;C dimerization. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the reduced energy barrier for C&#8722;C dimerization, and meanwhile impeding hydrogen evolution reaction on Cu/poly(2&#8208;aminoazulene) heterojunction, which are beneficial to CO2 reduction.

&lt;p&gt;Poly(2-aminoazulene), featured with a substantial dipole moment and abundant Lewis base amino groups, enhances the adsorption and boosts the reduction of carbon dioxide on Cu surface, yielding impressive ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% at 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The electrochemical conversion of carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) into hydrocarbon products emerges as a pivotal sustainable strategy for carbon utilization. Cu-based catalysts are currently prioritized as the most effective means for this process, yet it remains a long-term goal to achieve high product selectivity at elevated current densities. This study delved into exploring the influence of a topological poly(2-aminoazulene) with a substantial dipole moment on modulating the Cu surface dipole field to augment the catalytic activity involved in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The resulting Cu/poly(2-aminoazulene) heterojunction showcases a remarkable ethylene Faradaic efficiency of 68.9% even at a substantial current density of 1 A cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Through in situ Raman and in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy, poly(2-aminoazulene)-modified Cu electrode exhibits a heightened concentration of intermediates as compared to the bare Cu, proving advantageous for C&#8722;C dimerization. Theoretical calculations demonstrate the reduced energy barrier for C&#8722;C dimerization, and meanwhile impeding hydrogen evolution reaction on Cu/poly(2-aminoazulene) heterojunction, which are beneficial to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reduction. The catalyst design in this study, incorporating dipole moment considerations, not only investigates the influence of dipole moment on electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction but also pioneers an innovative strategy to augment catalytic activity by elevating the micro-concentration of reactants on catalyst surfaces.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Triplet Exciton Sensitization of Silicon Mediated by Defect States in Hafnium Oxynitride</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work investigates the influence of hafnium oxynitride interlayer composition on triplet exciton sensitization of singlet fission solar cells. Nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band&#8208;edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process.








Abstract
Singlet exciton fission has the potential to increase the efficiency of crystalline silicon solar cells beyond the conventional single junction limit. Perhaps the largest obstacle to achieving this enhancement is uncertainty about energy coupling mechanisms at the interfaces between silicon and exciton fission materials such as tetracene. Here, the previously reported silicon&#8208;hafnium oxynitride&#8208;tetracene structure is studied and a combination of magnetic&#8208;field&#8208;dependent silicon photoluminescence measurements and density functional theory calculations is used to probe the influence of the interlayer composition on the triplet transfer process across the hafnium oxynitride interlayer. It is found that hafnium oxide interlayers do not show triplet exciton sensitization of silicon, and that nitrogen content in hafnium oxynitride layers is correlated with enhanced sensitization. Calculation results reveal that defects in hafnium oxynitride interlayers with higher nitrogen content introduce states close to the band&#8208;edge of silicon, which can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process. Some defects introduce additional deleterious mid&#8208;gap states, which may explain observed silicon photoluminescence quenching. These results show that band&#8208;edge states can mediate the triplet exciton transfer process, potentially through a sequential charge transfer mechanism.

         <dc:description>
This study advances electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps by introducing a 3D&#8208;printable anti&#8208;swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP) technology, precise components are fabricated, resulting in a pump with 90.2&#160;kPa pressure and 800&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1 flow rate. A novel organohydrogel with low swelling and excellent mechanical properties enhances pump performance, supporting diverse soft robotics applications.








Abstract
This study introduces advancements in electrohydrodynamic (EHD) pumps and the development of a 3D&#8208;printable anti&#8208;swelling organohydrogel for soft robotics. Using digital light processing (DLP)technology, precise components with less than 1% size variation are fabricated, enabling a unique manifold pump array. This design achieves an output pressure of 90.2&#160;kPa&#8212;18 times higher than traditional configurations&#8212;and a flow rate of 800&#160;mL&#160;min&#8722;1, surpassing previous EHD pumps. To address swelling issues in dielectric liquids, a novel organohydrogel is developed with Young's modulus of 0.33&#160;MPa, 300% stretchability, and a swelling ratio under 10%. Its low swelling is attributed to the shield effect and edge length confinement effect. This durable material ensures consistent pump performance under mechanical stresses like bending and twisting, crucial for dynamic soft robotic environments. These innovations significantly improve EHD pump efficiency and reliability, expanding their potential applications in soft robotics, bioengineering, and vertical farming.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Dependent Nonlinear Optical Effects in Spiral WS2 Nanosheets</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The nonlinear response of spiral 2D transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides can be tailored on&#8208;demand through novel structural designs (such as aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;triangular spiral nanosheets) with scalable and reproducible method, which is beneficial to the integrated photonics and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip quantum devices.








Abstract
Spiral transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenides with broken crystal inversion symmetry and significant second&#8208;order nonlinear responses have shown great promise for further nonlinear optical applications. However, various spiral structures will be formed during their synthesis process, their second harmonic generation (SHG) varying with the layer thickness and which of them manifesting the most promising SHG response are still unresolved. Here, the layer&#8208;dependent SHG response is investigated for four representative spiral WS2 with different screw and twist angles, including aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;triangular spiral structures, aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;hexagonal spiral structures, respectively. Experimental results demonstrate that both aligned&#8208; and twisted&#8208;hexagonal spiral WS2 present weak SHG response. In contrast, the SHG signal of the aligned&#8208;triangular spiral WS2 almost quadratically increases with the lift of their thickness, which is two orders of magnitude stronger than hexagonal structures. Moreover, an oscillating layer&#8208;dependence SHG response for twisted&#8208;triangular spiral WS2 has been attributed to the restored inversion symmetry. The underlying mechanism has been explored by the evolution of their crystal symmetry. The results not only disclose that the nonlinear response of the spiral WS2 can be tailored on&#8208;demand through the novel structural designs, but also pave the way to scalable integrated photonics and lab&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip quantum devices based on spiral layered materials.

         <title>Solvent&#8208;Tuned Plasticity for Various Binder&#8208;Free Applications of a New Lead&#8208;Free Manganese Halide</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The lead&#8208;free metal halide CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits solvent&#8208;tuned plasticity, enabling the formation of binder&#8208;free thin films without requiring heat treatment. This unique property allows versatile processing into luminescent clay, direct ink writing patterns, and uniform thin layers, overcoming the limitations of conventional binder systems. These characteristics highlight its potential for applications in WLEDs, scintillators, and next&#8208;generation &#956;&#8208;LED displays.








Abstract
The development of efficient color conversion layers for &#956;&#8208;LED technology faces significant challenges owing to the limitations of materials that require binders. Binders are typically used to ensure uniform film formation in color&#8208;conversion layers, but they often cause optical losses, increase layer thickness, and introduce long&#8208;term stability issues. To address the limitations of materials requiring binders, cyclopropyltriphenylphosphonium manganese tetrabromide (CPTP2MnBr4) is synthesized, a novel lead&#8208;free metal halide. CPTP2MnBr4 exhibits unique solvent&#8208;based plasticity, which enables the formation of uniform films thinner than those formed with binders without the need for either heat treatment or binders. This approach eliminates the performance degradation typically associated with conventional binder systems such as optical losses and stability issues. Structural and optical analyses confirm its high luminescence efficiency and stability, supporting its potential applications in luminescent clays, direct ink writing, pattern printing, and ink drawing. Moreover, its successful application in white light&#8208;emitting diodes (WLEDs) and scintillators demonstrates that CPTP2MnBr4 can replace traditional binder systems, offering a solution to overcome the technical challenges in next&#8208;generation displays, lighting, and scintillator technologies.

         <title>Performance Enhancement of Carbon Nanotube Network Transistors via SbI3 Inner&#8208;Doping in Selected Regions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new structural device is constructed through contact engineering, where carbon nanotubes in the electrode area are filled with SbI3 molecular chains, resulting in low contact resistance, high carrier mobility, and an extremely low subthreshold swing.








Abstract
Semiconducting single&#8208;wall carbon nanotubes (s&#8208;SWCNTs) represent one of the most promising materials for surpassing Moore's Law and developing the next generation of electronic devices. Despite numerous developed approaches, reducing the contact resistance of s&#8208;SWCNTs networks remains a significant challenge in achieving further enhancements in electronic performance. In this study, antimony triiodide&#160;(SbI3) is efficiently encapsulated within high&#8208;purity s&#8208;SWCNTs films at low temperatures, forming 1D SbI3@s&#8208;SWCNTs vdW heterostructures. The semiconductor&#8211;metal transition of individual SbI3@s&#8208;SWCNTs is characterized via sensitive dielectric force microscopy, with the results confirmed through electrical device tests. The electrical behavior transition is attributed to an interlayer charge transfer, as demonstrated by Kelvin probe force microscopy. Moreover, the electrical performance of s&#8208;SWCNTs thin&#8208;film transistors improves significantly with SbI3@s&#8208;SWCNTs networks as contact electrodes. This process reduces the contact resistance between the s&#8208;SWCNTs channel and the electrodes, enhancing electrical performance. Specifically, the contact resistance decreases to one&#8208;third of the original, the carrier mobility increases by &#8776;10&#160;times, the on&#8208;off ratio exceeds 106, and the subthreshold swing reduces significantly to &#8776;65&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of inner&#8208;doping&#8208;induced metallization of s&#8208;SWCNTs in the contact region, essential for advancing&#160;carbon nanotube electronic devices and circuits.

         <title>Hydrolysis of 2D Nanosheets Reverses Rheumatoid Arthritis Through Anti&#8208;Inflammation and Osteogenesis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The hydrolysis of the fabricated calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) produces anti&#8208;oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammatory, and pro&#8208;osteogenesis resulting in&#160;considerably outperformed RA therapeutics. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility.








Abstract
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a kind of inflammation homeostasis disorder that dysfunctions the joints. Clinically, medications against RA focus simply on mitigating the focal inflammation, without considering pro&#8208;osteogenesis re&#8208;modeling of the bone microenvironment. In the present work, 2D layered calcium disilicide nanoparticles (CSNs) are fabricated by facile aqueous exfoliation. The hydrolysis of CSNs produces anti&#8208;oxidative H2, alkaline Ca(OH)2, and silica. These moieties play significant roles in anti&#8208;oxidation, anti&#8208;inflammation, and pro&#8208;osteogenesis resulting in&#160;considerably better RA therapeutic consequences than anti&#8208;inflammation alone. Hydrogen gas is validated to eliminate excessive hydroxyl radicals and regulate macrophage re&#8208;polarization; the generated Ca(OH)2 can neutralize the acidic microenvironment and inhibit the osteoclast activity; and, the dissolved Ca2+ can effectively complex with phosphates to mineralize Ca3(PO4)2, promoting the osteogenesis of the focal joint. The multifunctional performances of CSNs are further confirmed in arthritic mouse and rabbit models, providing an advanced and robust therapeutic strategy against RA with high biocompatibility and clinical transformable promises.

         <title>In Situ Reconstructed Hydroxyl&#8208;Rich Atomic&#8208;Thin Bi2O2CO3 Enables Ampere&#8208;Scale Synthesis of Formate from CO2 with Activated Water Dissociation</title>

         <dc:description>
The hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized atomic&#8208;thin bismuth subcarbonate in situ transformed from bismuth hydroxide nanotubes enables highly efficient and durable carbon dioxide electroreduction into formate. The unique OH&#8208;decoration facilitates active hydrogen supply in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes by enhanced water dissociation and strengthened the adsorption of the critical oxygenated intermediate with highly localized surface electron configuration.








Abstract
Renewable electricity&#8208;driven CO2 electroreduction provides a promising route toward carbon neutrality and sustainable chemical production. Nevertheless, the viability of this route faces constraints of catalytic efficiency and durability in near&#8208;neutral electrolytes at industrial&#8208;scale current densities, mechanistically originating from unfavorable accommodation of *H species from water dissociation. Herein, a new strategy is reported to accelerate water dissociation by the rich surface hydroxyl on bismuth subcarbonate nanosheets in situ electrochemical transformed from bismuth hydroxide nanotube precursors. This catalyst enables the electrosynthesis of formate at current densities up to 1000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 with &gt;96% faradaic efficiencies in flow cells, and a 200&#160;h durable membrane electrode assembly in a dilute near&#8208;neutral environment. Combined kinetic studies, in situ characterizations, and theoretical calculations reveal that the atomic thickness strengthens the hydroxyl adsorption, and with a highly localized electron configuration, the hydroxyl&#8208;functionalized surface is more affinitive to oxygenated species, thus lowering the barrier for water dissociation and the crucial hydrogenation step in the proton&#8208;coupled electron transfer from *OCHO to *HCOOH.

Chiral MnO2 supraparticles as renal&#8208;clearance biosensors for dual&#8208;mode in vivo detection of metalloproteinase&#8208;9 in early cancer diagnosis via circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).








Abstract
In this study, polypeptide TGGGPLGVARGKGGC&#8208;induced chiral manganese dioxide supraparticles (MnO2 SPs) are prepared for sensitive quantification of matrix metalloproteinase&#8208;9 (MMP&#8208;9) in vitro and in vivo. The results show that L&#8208;type manganese dioxide supraparticles (L&#8208;MnO2 SPs) exhibited twice the affinity for the cancer cell membrane receptor CD47 (cluster of differentiation, integrin&#8208;associated protein) than D&#8208;type manganese dioxide supraparticles (D&#8208;MnO2 SPs) to accumulate at the tumor site after surface modification of the internalizing arginine&#8208;glycine&#8208;aspartic acid (iRGD) ligand, specifically reacting with the MMP&#8208;9, disassembling into ultrasmall nanoparticles (NPs), and efficiently underwent renal clearance. Furthermore, L&#8208;MnO2 facilitates the quantification of MMP&#8208;9 in mouse tumor xenografts, as demonstrated by circular dichroism (CD) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 2 h. A strong linear relationship is observed between MMP&#8208;9 concentration and both CD and MRI intensity, ranging from 0.01 to 10&#160;ng&#160;mL&#8722;1. The corresponding limits of detection (LOD) are 0.0054&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 for CD and 0.0062&#160;ng mL&#8722;1 for MRI, respectively. hese SPs provide a new approach for exploring chiral advanced biosensors for early diagnosis of cancer.

         <title>Time&#8208;Reversal Symmetry Breaking Superconductivity in HfRhGe: A Noncentrosymmetric Weyl Semimetal</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
HfRhGe, a promising noncentrosymmetric material for topological superconductivity, exhibits time&#8208;reversal symmetry (TRS)&#8208;protected Weyl topology in its normal state, featuring disconnected Fermi sheets and multiple surface Fermi arcs. It enters a superconducting phase at low temperatures with a TRS&#8208;breaking ground state, evidenced by muon&#8208;spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) measurements, detecting a spontaneous magnetic field offering potential applications in quantum electronics.








Abstract
Weyl semimetals are a novel class of topological materials with unique electronic structures and distinct properties. HfRhGe stands out as a noncentrosymmetric Weyl semimetal with unconventional superconducting characteristics. Using muon&#8208;spin rotation and relaxation (&#181;SR) spectroscopy and thermodynamic measurements, a fully gapped superconducting state is identified in HfRhGe that breaks time&#8208;reversal symmetry at the superconducting transition. This breaking can trigger a topological phase transition, as time&#8208;reversal symmetry protects the normal&#8208;state Weyl topology characterized by comprehensive first&#8208;principles calculations. Ginzburg&#8208;Landau analysis suggests an unconventional loop supercurrent superconducting state realized in HfRhGe. The presence of multiple Weyl points near the Fermi level and surface Fermi arcs dispersing across the Fermi level further support HfRhGe as a promising platform for topological superconductivity. Additionally, its noncentrosymmetric nature with time&#8208;reversal symmetry breaking superconducting state suggests that it can exhibit an intrinsic superconducting diode effect, offering novel optical and transport properties, with potential applications in dissipationless quantum&#160;electronics.

         <title>Solid&#8208;State Oxide&#8208;Ion Synaptic Transistor for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel all&#8208;solid&#8208;state oxide&#8208;ion synaptic transistor is developed, based on a Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 oxide&#8208;ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3&#8208;&#948; variable&#8208;resistance electrodes (channel, gate). This synaptic transistor efficiently operates at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics, exhibiting key synaptic behaviors with low energy consumption and high endurance. Integrated into an artificial neural network simulation, it achieved 96% accuracy in handwritten digit recognition, demonstrating significant potential for neuromorphic computing applications.








Abstract
Neuromorphic hardware facilitates rapid and energy&#8208;efficient training and operation of neural network models for artificial intelligence. However, existing analog in&#8208;memory computing devices, like memristors, continue to face significant challenges that impede their commercialization. These challenges include high variability due to their stochastic nature. Microfabricated electrochemical synapses offer a promising approach by functioning as an analog programmable resistor based on deterministic ion&#8208;insertion mechanisms. Here, an all&#8208;solid&#8208;state oxide&#8208;ion synaptic transistor is developed, employing Bi2V0.9Cu0.1O5.35 as a superior oxide&#8208;ion conductor electrolyte and La0.5Sr0.5FeO3&#8208;&#948; as a variable&#8208;resistance channel able to efficiently operate at temperatures compatible with conventional electronics. This transistor exhibits essential synaptic behaviors such as long&#8208; and short&#8208;term potentiation, paired&#8208;pulse facilitation, and post&#8208;tetanic potentiation, mimicking fundamental properties of biological neural networks. Key criteria for efficient neuromorphic computing are satisfied, including excellent linear and symmetric synaptic plasticity, low energy consumption per programming pulse, and high endurance with minimal cycle&#8208;to&#8208;cycle variation. Integrated into an artificial neural network (ANN) simulation for handwritten digit recognition, the presented synaptic transistor achieved a 96% accuracy on the Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology&#160;(MNIST) dataset, illustrating the effective implementation of the device in ANNs. These findings demonstrate the potential of oxide&#8208;ion based synaptic transistors for effective implementation in analog neuromorphic computing based on&#160;iontronics.

         <title>An &#8220;Outer Piezoelectric and Inner Epigenetic&#8221; Logic&#8208;Gated PANoptosis for Osteosarcoma Sono&#8208;Immunotherapy and Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
3D&#8208;printed biomaterials equipped with an &#8220;outer AND inner&#8221; logic gate are developed by integrating porous piezoelectric sonosensitizers with bioactive glass scaffolds. Ultrasound, acting as the &#8220;outer&#8221; input signal, can generate reactive oxygen species, and bioactive drugs loaded in sonosensitizers serve as the &#8220;inner&#8221; input signal to implement epigenetic demethylation regulation. Combining the AND logic&#8208;triggered effects, cancer&#8208;specific PANoptosis activation is achieved to boost antitumor immune response. Thus, the biomaterial platform enables enhanced sono&#8208;piezoelectric immunotherapy for osteosarcoma, along with related antibacterial effects and bone defect repair.








Abstract
The precise manipulation of PANoptosis, a newly defined cell death pathway encompassing pyroptosis, apoptosis, and necroptosis, is highly desired to achieve safer cancer immunotherapy with tumor&#8208;specific inflammatory responses and minimal side effects. Nonetheless, this objective remains a formidable challenge. Herein, an &#8220;AND&#8221; logic&#8208;gated strategy for accurately localized PANoptosis activation, utilizing composite 3D&#8208;printed bioactive glasses scaffolds integrated with epigenetic regulator&#8208;loaded porous piezoelectric SrTiO3 nanoparticles is proposed. The &#8220;logic&#8208;gated&#8221; strategy is co&#8208;programmed by an &#8220;outer&#8221; input signal of exogenous ultrasound irradiation to produce reactive oxygen species and an &#8220;inner&#8221; input signal of acid tumor microenvironment to ensure the epigenetic demethylation regulation, guaranteeing the tumor&#8208;specific PANoptosis. Specifically, immunogenic PANoptosis triggers dendritic cell maturation and cytotoxic T cell activation, amplifying antitumor immune responses and significantly suppressing osteosarcoma growth, with a suppression rate of &#8776;73.47&#160;&#177;&#160;5.2%. In addition, the well&#8208;known bioactivities of Sr&#8208;doped scaffolds expedite osteogenic differentiation and reinforce bone regeneration. Therefore, this work provides a paradigm of logic&#8208;gated sono&#8208;piezoelectric biomaterial platform with concurrently exogenous/endogenous activated PANoptosis for controlled sono&#8208;immunotherapy of osteosarcoma, and related bone defects repair.

         <title>In Situ Conversion of Artificial Proton&#8208;Rich Shell to Inorganic Maskant Toward Stable Single&#8208;Crystal Ni&#8208;Rich Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In situ conversion of proton&#8208;rich shell to sub&#8208;nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant, which protects the single&#8208;crystal Ni&#8208;rich cathode from the attack of electrolyte in the long&#8208;term cycling and enables superhigh capacity retention of 83% after 800 cycles.








Abstract
Single&#8208;crystal high&#8208;nickel oxide with an integral structure can prevent intergranular cracks and the associated detrimental reactions. Yet, its low surface&#8208;to&#8208;volume ratio makes surficial degradation a more critical factor in electrochemical performance. Herein, artificial proton&#8208;rich (ammonium bicarbonate) shell is successfully introduced on the nickel&#8208;rich LiNi0.92Co0.06Mn0.02O2 single crystals for in situ electrochemically conversing into inorganic maskant to enhance stability of cathode. The process is that the surficial enriched proton, once released from the ammonium bicarbonate shell (proton reservoir) during 1st charge, is immediately captured by LiPF6, in situ electrochemically conversing to LiF and Li3PO4 sub&#8208;nano particle dense maskant (sub&#8208;nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant). The in situ formed compact nano F&#8208;&amp;P&#8208;maskant significantly resists the cathode against electrolyte attack and improves the surface stability of particles during long&#8208;term cycling. Consequently, this surface modification enables 95% capacity retention after 100 cycles at a high voltage of 4.5&#160;V in the half cell and 83% capacity retention after 800 cycles in the full cell. This work demonstrates a strategy for reconstructing the protective layer using the rational design of surficial enriched proton shells for advanced lithium batteries.

         <title>Multidirectional Sliding Ferroelectricity of Rhombohedral&#8208;Stacked InSe for Reconfigurable Photovoltaics and Imaging Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity in &#947;&#8208;InSe with a tunable bulk photovoltaic effect due to the existence of multiple polarization states is reported. The multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity is predicted by the theoretical calculations and multiple domain walls are observed experimentally. The multidirectional sliding ferroelectric polarization paves the path to explore novel optoelectronic applications like real&#8208;time imaging and neuromorphic computing.








Abstract
Through the stacking technique of 2D materials, the interfacial polarization can be switched by an interlayer sliding, known as sliding ferroelectricity, which is advantageous in ultra&#8208;thin thickness, high switching speed, and high fatigue resistance. However, uncovering the relationship between the sliding path and the polarization state in rhombohedral&#8208;stacked materials remains a challenge, which is the key to 2D sliding ferroelectricity. Here, layer&#8208;dependent multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity in rhombohedral&#8208;stacked InSe (&#947;&#8208;InSe) is reported via dual&#8208;frequency resonance tracking piezoresponse force microscopy and conductive atomic force microscopy. The graphene/&#947;&#8208;InSe/graphene tunneling device exhibits a tunable bulk photovoltaic effect with a photovoltaic current density of &#8776;15&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2 due to multiple polarization states. The generation of dome&#8208;like domain walls is observed experimentally, which is attributed to the multidirectional sliding&#8208;induced domains based on the theoretical calculations. Furthermore, the ferroelectric polarization in &#947;&#8208;InSe ensures that the tunneling device has a high photo responsivity of &#8776;255 A&#160;W&#8722;1 and a fast response time for real&#8208;time imaging. The work not only provides insights into the multidirectional sliding ferroelectricity of rhombohedral&#8208;stacked 2D materials but also highlights their potential for tunable photovoltaics and imaging applications.

         <title>Clarifying the Active Structure and Reaction Mechanism of Atomically Dispersed Metal and Nonmetal Sites with Enhanced Activity for Oxygen Reduction Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel atomically dispersed catalyst (Co&#9472;Se/Co/NC) with the coexistence of Co single&#8208;atom sites and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites, exhibits outstanding ORR activity and stability. The introduction of Se single atoms and the synergistic effect of Co single&#8208;atom and Co&#9472;Se dual atom can modulate the d&#8208;band center of metal sites and promote the desorption of *OH, thereby significantly accelerating the ORR process.








Abstract
Atomically dispersed transition metal (ADTM) catalysts are widely implemented in energy conversion reactions, while the similar properties of TMs make it difficult to continuously improve the activity of ADTMs via tuning the composition of metals. Introducing nonmetal sites into ADTMs may help to effectively modulate the electronic structure of metals and significantly improve the activity. However, it is difficult to achieve the co&#8208;existence of ADTMs with nonmetal atoms and clarify their synergistic effect on the catalytic mechanism. Therefore, elucidating the active sites within atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nonmetal materials and unveiling catalytic mechanism is highly important. Herein, a novel hybrid catalyst, with coexistence of Co single&#8208;atoms and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites (Co&#9472;Se/Co/NC), is successfully synthesized and exhibits remarkable performance for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR). Theoretical results demonstrate that the Se sites can effectively modulate the charge redistribution at Co active sites. Furthermore, the synergistic effect between Co single&#8208;atom sites and Co&#9472;Se dual&#8208;atom sites can further adjust the d&#8208;band center, optimize the adsorption/desorption behavior of intermediates, and finally accelerate the ORR kinetics. This work has clearly clarified the reaction mechanism and shows the great potential of atomically dispersed metal&#8208;nonmetal nanomaterials for energy conversion and storage applications.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Alloy Nanoflower Array Electrodes with Optimizable Reaction Pathways for Low&#8208;Voltage Hydrogen Production at Industrial&#8208;Grade Current Density</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Developing sufficiently effective bifunctional electrodes for low&#8208;voltage hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current density is highly significant but challenging. This work innovatively engineers high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoflower array electrodes with abundant high&#8208;activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways, and achieves unprecedented performance for two&#8208;electrode hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current densities.








Abstract
Developing sufficiently effective non&#8208;precious metal catalysts for large&#8208;current&#8208;density hydrogen production is highly significant but challenging, especially in low&#8208;voltage hydrogen production systems. Here, we innovatively report high&#8208;entropy alloy nanoflower array (HEANFA) electrodes with optimizable reaction pathways for hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted hydrogen production at industrial&#8208;grade current densities. Atomic&#8208;resolution structural analyses confirm the single&#8208;phase solid&#8208;solution structure of HEANFA. The HEANFA electrodes exhibit the top&#8208;level electrocatalytic performance for both the alkaline hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and hydrazine oxidation reaction (HzOR). Furthermore, the hydrazine oxidation&#8208;assisted splitting (OHzS) system assembled with HEANFA as both anode and cathode exhibits a record&#8208;breaking performance for hydrogen production. It achieves ultralow working voltages of 0.003, 0.081, 0.260, 0.376, and 0.646&#160;V for current densities of 10, 100, 500, 1&#160;000, and 2&#160;000&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, respectively, and remarkable stability for 300&#160;h, significantly outperforming those of previously reported OHzS systems and other chemicals&#8208;assisted hydrogen production systems. Theoretical calculations reveal that extraordinary performance of HEANFA for OHzS is attributed to its abundant high&#8208;activity sites and optimizable reaction pathways in HER and HzOR. In particular, HEANFA enables intelligent migration of key intermediates during HzOR, thereby optimizing the reaction pathways and creating high&#8208;activity sites, ultimately endowing the extraordinary performance for OHzS.

         <title>Na+&#8208;Complexed Dendritic Polyglycerols for Recovery of Frozen Cells and Their Network in Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Cryoprotectants in biological buffer systems often struggle due to the presence of abundant salts. A precise topological control of polyglycerols provides unique retention&#8208;and&#8208;release of sodium ions, which activates the formation of hydrogen bonding with ice interfaces. This interaction allows the polymer to inhibit ice growths both in intra&#8208; and extracellular spaces, resulting in successful post&#8208;thaw cell survival and network&#8208;forming functionality.








Abstract
In this study, a novel phenomenon is identified where precise control of topology and generation of polyglycerol induce the retention of Na+ ions in biological buffer systems, effectively inhibiting ice crystal growth during cryopreservation. Unlike linear and hyperbranched counterparts, densely&#8208;packed hydroxyl and ether groups in 4th&#8208;generation dendritic polyglycerol interact with the ions, activating the formation of hydrogen bonding at the ice interface. By inhibiting both intra&#8208; and extracellular ice growth and recrystallization, this biocompatible dendritic polyglycerol proves highly effective as a cryoprotectant; hence, achieving the cell recovery rates of &#8776;134&#8211;147%, relative to those of 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, which is a conventional cryoprotectant for human tongue squamous carcinoma (HSC&#8208;3) cell line and human umbilical vein endothelial (HUVEC) cells. Further, it successfully recovers the network&#8208;forming capabilities of HUVEC cells to &#8776;89% in tube formation after thawing. The Na+ ion retention&#8208;driven ice&#8208;growth inhibition activity in biological media highlights the unique properties of dendritic polyglycerol and introduces a new topological concept for cell&#8208;cryoprotectant development.

The in situ dynamic transformation of the planar Ni&#8722;N4 to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configuration is revealed, showing enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 reduction. The integrated merits of network support and in situ tailored low&#8208;valance&#8208;state Ni site endow outstanding performance in acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.








Abstract
Carbon&#8208;supported single&#8208;atom catalysts exhibit exceptional properties in acidic CO2 reduction. However, traditional carbon supports fall short in building high&#8208;site&#8208;utilization and CO2&#8208;rich interfacial environments, and the structural evolution of single&#8208;atom metals and catalytic mechanisms under realistic conditions remain ambiguous. Herein, an interconnected mesoporous carbon nanofiber and carbon nanosheet network (IPCF@CS) is reported, derived from microphase&#8208;separated block copolymer, to improve catalytic efficiency of isolated Ni. In IPCF@CS nanostructure, highly mesoporous IPCF hinders stacking of CS that provides additional fully exposed sites and abundant bicontinuous mesochannels of IPCF facilitate smooth CO2 transport. Such unique features enable enhanced Ni utilization and local CO2 enrichment, which cannot be achieved over conventional pore&#8208;deficient and discontinuous porous carbon fibers&#8208;based supports. In situ X&#8208;ray and Infrared spectroscopy coupling constant&#8208;potential calculations reveal the dynamic distortion of the planar Ni&#8722;N4 to an out&#8208;of&#8208;plane configuration with expanded Ni&#8722;N bond during operating CO2 electroreduction. The potential&#8208;driven low&#8208;valance&#8208;state Ni&#8722;N4 possesses enhanced intrinsic electrokinetics for CO2 activation and CO desorption yet inhibiting hydrogen evolution. The favorable electronic and interfacial reaction environments, resulted from the in situ tailored Ni site and IPCF@CS support, achieve an FE of near 100% at 540&#160;mA&#160;cm&#8722;2, a TOF of 55.5 s&#8722;1, and a SPCE of 89.2% in acidic CO2&#8208;to&#8208;CO electrolysis.

         <title>Chlorine Axial Coordination Activated Lanthanum Single Atoms for Efficient Oxygen Electroreduction with Maximum Utilization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a universal synthesis method for rare&#8208;earth single&#8208;atom catalysts with Cl axially coordination for oxygen reduction reaction (ORR), which exhibits excellent ORR activity and successful applications in zinc&#8208;air batteries. The strong d&#8208;p orbital coupling between La and Cl significantly improves the electronic structure of the La site, ensuring efficient activation of O2 and suitable adsorption of *OH.








Abstract
Currently, there are still obstacles to rationally designing the ligand fields to activate rare&#8208;earth (RE) elements with satisfactory intrinsic electrocatalytic reactivity. Herein, axial coordination strategies and nanostructure design are applied for the construction of La single atoms (La&#8208;Cl SAs/NHPC) with satisfactory oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) activity. The nontrivial LaN4Cl2 motifs configuration and the hierarchical porous carbon substrate that facilitates maximized metal atom utilization ensure high half&#8208;wave potential (0.91&#160;V) and significant robustness in alkaline media. The aqueous and flexible Zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB) integrating La&#8208;Cl SAs/NHPC as the cathode catalyst exhibits a maximum power density of 260.7 and 68.5&#160;mW cm&#8722;2, representing one of the most impressive RE&#8208;based ORR electrocatalysts to date. Theoretical calculations have demonstrated that the Cl coordination evidently modulate the electronic structures of La sites, which promoted electron transfer efficiency by d&#8208;p orbital couplings. With enhanced electroactivity of La sites, the adsorptions of key intermediates are optimized to alleviate the energy barriers of the potential&#8208;determining step. Importantly, this preparation strategy is also successfully applied to other REs. This work provides perspectives for near&#8208;range electronic structure modulation of RE&#8208;SAs based on a nonplanar coordination micro&#8208;environment for efficient electrocatalysis.

         <title>Bio&#8208;Inspired Multiple Responsive NIR II Nanophosphors for Reversible and Environment&#8208;Interactive Information Encryption</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Zn1.2Ga1.6Ge0.2O4:Ni2+ nanophosphor with NIR II emission that is responsive to environmental stimuli including temperature and specific solvent variations has been successfully prepared. Leveraging the unique properties of ZGGO:Ni NIR II nanophosphors, an innovative environment&#8208;interactive information encryption strategy with multiple dimensions, including wavelength, luminescence lifetime, and external stimuli like temperature and humidity has been developed to enhance information security.








Abstract
Inspired by the natural responsive phenomena, herein the multiple responsive persistent luminescent Zn1.2Ga1.6Ge0.2O4:Ni2+ (ZGGO:Ni) nanoparticles with near&#8208;infrared &#160;(NIR) II&#160;emission peak &#8776;1330&#160;nm derived from the Ni2+ doping through controlled synthesis based on hydrothermal method are obtained. The obtained NIR II persistent luminescent ZGGO:Ni can not only respond to temperature but also the specific solvent stimulus. The results demonstrate that the NIR II persistent luminescence intensity decreases in hydroxyl containing solvent such as water (H2O) and ethyl alcohol (C2H6O), while the PL intensity remains in solvent without hydroxyl groups such as n&#8208;hexane (C6H14) and deuterated water (D2O). This NIR II luminescence quenching is attributed to the adsorption of interaction hydroxyl groups in specific solvents with the amino group on the surface of ZGGO:Ni and the subsequent fluorescence resonance energy transfer mechanism. Benefiting from the multiple responsive properties, the obtained NIR II persistent luminescent ZGGO:Ni is utilized for high&#8208;order dynamic optical information encryption, providing increased security level. The multi&#8208;responsive NIR II persistent luminescence strategy outlined in this study is anticipated to offer a straightforward methodology for optimizing the optical characteristics of NIR II persistent luminescent materials. Moreover, it is set to expand the scope of their applications in the realm of dynamic and environment&#8208;interactive information encryption, thereby opening frontiers for their utilization in advanced security measures.

         <title>Cu&#8208;ZnS Modulated Multi&#8208;Carbon Coupling Enables High Selectivity Photoreduction CO2 to CH3CH2COOH</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The as&#8208;prepared Cu&#8208;ZnS exhibits excellent performance in the selective photoreduction of CO&#8322; to CH&#8323;CH&#8322;COOH, achieving a production rate of 0.45 &#181;mol h&#8722;&#185;, which increases to 16.9 &#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with triethanolamine while maintaining a high product selectivity of 97%. Using in situ experimental techniques and theoretical calculations, the key C&#8323; intermediates are identified providing crucial insights into the CH&#8323;CH&#8322;COOH formation pathway.








Abstract
The direct photocatalytic conversion of CO2 and H2O into high&#8208;value C3 chemicals holds great promise but remains challenging due to the intrinsic difficulty of C1&#8211;C1 and C2&#8211;C1 coupling processes and the lack of clarity regarding the underlying reaction mechanisms. Here, the design and synthesis of a Cu&#8208;ZnS photocatalyst featuring dispersed Cu single atoms are reported. These Cu single atoms are coordinated with S atoms, forming unique Cu&#8208;S&#8208;Zn active units with tunable charge distributions that interact favorably with surface&#8208;adsorbed intermediates. This configuration stabilizes the *COHCO intermediate and facilitates its subsequent coupling with *CO to form *COCOHCO both thermodynamically and kinetically favorable on the Cu&#8208;ZnS surface. Notably, multiple critical C3 intermediates, including *COCOHCO, *OCCCO, and *CHCHCO, are identified, providing a clear reaction pathway for CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion. The Cu&#8208;ZnS photocatalyst achieves a CO2 to CH3CH2COOH conversion rate of 0.45&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with an electron selectivity of 91.2%. Remarkably, in the presence of triethanolamine, the production rate increases to 16.9&#160;&#181;mol h&#8722;&#185; with a selectivity of 99.8%. These findings underscore the importance of modulating multicarbon coupling processes to enable the efficient photocatalytic transformation of CO2 into C3 products, paving the way for future advancements in sustainable chemical synthesis.

         <title>High&#8208;Entropy Metal Interstitials Activate TiO2 for Robust Catalytic Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel category of high&#8208;entropy metal oxides, functionalized by multiple metal interstitials, exhibits significant lattice distortion that inhibits metal leaching and enhances electron contribution for efficient catalytic oxidation.








Abstract
Substitution metal doping strategies are crucial for developing catalysts capable of activating O2, but the leaching of metal dopants has greatly hindered their potential for extensive oxidation reactions under mild conditions. Here, the study develops an entropy&#8208;increase strategy to synthesize high&#8208;entropy metal (Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, and Co) interstitial functionalized anatase TiO2 (HE&#8208;TiO2) nanosheets, demonstrating remarkable degradation efficiency across a wide pH range and exceptional stability in a flow&#8208;by electro&#8208;catalytic reactor. Relative to that of pristine TiO2, the intense lattice distortion on the (001) plane, an average lattice expansion of 2% on the (100) plane, and decrease of second shell peak of X&#8208;ray absorption spectra serve as compelling evidence for the formation of metal interstitials in HE&#8208;TiO2. Theoretical analysis and in situ synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared studies reveal that the electron of metal interstitials can populate the subgap states within the host TiO2, enabling a moderate adsorption band for robust and efficient O2 activation. This study introduces a universal strategy for synthesizing a novel class of high&#8208;entropy materials with integrated metal interstitials in metal oxides, promising to enhance the stability and efficiency of O2 activation catalysts and broaden their potential applications.

         <title>A Universal Strategy to Mitigate Microphase Separation via Cellulose Nanocrystal Hydration in Fabricating Strong, Tough, and Fatigue&#8208;Resistant Hydrogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A universal phase&#8208;engineering strategy is reported to achieve mechanically robust hydrogels by tuning microphase separation using cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) and common compatible polymer systems. CNC plays a crucial role in contributing to mitigating microphase separation for strengthening and toughening hydrogels. Benefiting from the CNC&#8208;mitigated microphase separation structure, the enabling hydrogel exhibits unprecedented combinations in mechanical properties.








Abstract
As a common natural phenomenon, phase separation is exploited for the development of high&#8208;performance hydrogels. Using supersaturated salt to create microphase&#8208;separated hydrogels with strengthened mechanical properties has gained widespread attention. However, such strengthened hydrogel loses its intrinsic flexibility, making the phase separation strategy unsuitable for the fabrication of stretchable and tough hydrogels. Here, a phase&#8208;engineering design strategy is introduced to produce stretchable yet tough hydrogels using supersaturated NaAc salt, by leveraging the hydration effect of cellulose nanocrystal (CNC) to mitigate microphase separation. The CNC&#8208;mitigated microphase&#8208;separated hydrogel presents unprecedented mechanical properties, for example, tensile strength of 1.8&#160;MPa with a fracture strain of 4730%, toughness of 43.1&#160;MJ m&#8722;3, fracture energy of 75.4&#160;kJ m&#8722;2, and fatigue threshold up to 3884.7 J m&#8722;2. Furthermore, this approach is universal in synthesizing various microphase separation&#8208;enhanced polymer gels, including polyacrylic acid, poly(acrylic acid&#8208;co&#8208;acrylamide), gelatin, and alginate. These advancements provide insights into the incorporation of CNC&#8208;mediated microphase separation structures in hydrogels, which will foster the future development of high&#8208;performance soft materials.

         <title>Bond Confinement&#8208;Dependent Peierls Distortion in Epitaxially Grown Bismuth Films</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper investigates the influence of thickness on the properties of thin epitaxial Bi films. It discusses results from optical, vibrational, and structural analyses, highlighting notable changes in dielectric function, phonon frequencies, and Peierls distortion. The competition between electron localization and delocalization is emphasized, showing how thickness reduction can tailor material properties without changing stoichiometry.








Abstract
A systematic study of the impact of film thickness on the properties of thin Bi films is presented. To this end, epitaxial films of high quality have been grown on a Si&#160;(111) substrate with thicknesses ranging from 1.9 to 29.9&#160;nm. Broadband optical spectroscopy reveals a notable decline in the optical dielectric constant and the absorption peak height as the film thickness decreases, alongside a shift of the absorption maximum to higher photon energies. Raman and pump&#8208;probe spectroscopy show that the phonon mode frequencies increase upon decreasing film thickness, with the in&#8208;plane mode frequency rising by 10% from the thickest to the thinnest sample. The X&#8208;ray diffraction analysis reveals an increasing Peierls distortion for thinner films, explaining the observed property changes. Quantum chemical bonding analysis and density functional theory calculations show that the properties of thin bismuth are influenced by the interplay between electron localization and delocalization, characteristic of metavalently bonded solids. This study shows that for solids that utilize metavalent bonding, a thickness reduction leads to significant property changes. The effect can even be employed to tailor material properties without the need to change material stoichiometry.

         <title>Machine Learning Driven Optimization of Electrolyte for Highly Reversible Zn&#8208;Air Batteries with Superior Long&#8208;Term Cycling Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Machine learning has been successfully employed to optimize the compositions of multicomponent electrolytes. As a result, the as&#8208;obtained novel Zn&#8208;air batteries can deliver superior battery reversibility and stability (1700 h at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1400 h at 20 mA cm&#8722;2), and greatly improved round&#8208;trip efficiency as high as 76.3%.








Abstract
Aqueous alkaline Zn&#8208;air batteries (ZABs) have garnered widespread attention due to their high energy density and safety, however, the poor electrochemical reversibility of Zn and low battery round&#8208;trip efficiency strongly limit their further development. The manipulation of an intricate microscopic balance among anode/electrolyte/cathode, to enhance the performance of ZABs, critically relies on the formula of electrolytes. Herein, the Bayesian optimization approach is employed to achieve the effective design of optimal compositions of multicomponent electrolytes, resulting in the remarkable enhancement of ZAB performance. Notably, ethylene glycol has been successfully employed as both electrolyte additive and fuel, playing key roles in changing the reaction pathways of ZABs, especially the storage form of discharge products from ZnO deposition on the anode to Zn2+&#8208;based hybrid particle colloids in the electrolyte. As a result, the as&#8208;obtained novel ZABs can deliver superior battery reversibility and stability (1700 h at 2 mA cm&#8722;2 and 1400 h at 20 mA cm&#8722;2), greatly improved round&#8208;trip efficiency as high as 76.3%, and even continuous discharge until complete Zn anode depletion. This work has demonstrated enormous potential for long&#8208;term energy storage applications and holds promise for bringing new opportunities to the development of ZABs.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Stiff yet Super&#8208;Elastic Graphene Aerogels by Topological Cellular Hierarchy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ultra&#8208;stiff yet super&#8208;elastic aerogel is realized through the design of a topological cellular hierarchy, enabling it to support high loads through preferably reversible buckling deformation, thereby overcoming the intrinsic conflict between high stiffness and superior recoverability.








Abstract
Lightweight cellular materials with high stiffness and excellent recoverability are critically important in structural engineering applications, but the intrinsic conflict between these two properties presents a significant challenge. Here, a topological cellular hierarchy is presented, designed to fabricate ultra&#8208;stiff (&gt;10 MPa modulus) yet super&#8208;elastic (&gt;90% recoverable strain) graphene aerogels.

&lt;p&gt;An ultra-stiff yet super-elastic aerogel is realized through the design of a topological cellular hierarchy, enabling it to support high loads through preferably reversible buckling deformation, thereby overcoming the intrinsic conflict between high stiffness and superior recoverability.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lightweight cellular materials with high stiffness and excellent recoverability are critically important in structural engineering applications, but the intrinsic conflict between these two properties presents a significant challenge. Here, a topological cellular hierarchy is presented, designed to fabricate ultra-stiff (&amp;gt;10 MPa modulus) yet super-elastic (&amp;gt;90% recoverable strain) graphene aerogels. This topological cellular hierarchy, composed of massive corrugated pores and nanowalls, is designed to carry high loads through predominantly reversible buckling within the honeycomb framework. The compressive modulus of the as-prepared graphene aerogel is nearly twice that of conventional graphene aerogel. This high-stiff graphene aerogel also exhibits exceptional mechanical recoverability, achieving up to 60% strain recovery over 10&#160;000 fatigue cycles without significant structural failure, outperforming most previously reported porous lattices and monoliths. It is further demonstrated that this graphene aerogel exhibits superior energy dissipation and anti-fatigue dynamic impact properties, with an energy absorption capacity nearly an order of magnitude greater than that of conventional aerogels. These exceptional properties of the topological cellular graphene aerogel open new avenues for high-energy bullet protection, offering great promise for the development of lightweight, armor-like protective materials in transportation and aerospace applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Concurrent Pressure&#8208;Induced Superconductivity and Photoconductivity Transitions in PbSe0.5Te0.5</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are discovered in PbSe0.5Te0.5 accompanying pressure&#8208;induced phase transitions. Both have a strong structure dependence and are jointly mediated by electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which is switchable via illumination or cooling at high&#8208;pressure. New findings offer more new insights into understanding the essence of photoelectric&#8208;lattice coupling and developing versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.








Abstract
Concurrent superconductivity and negative photoconductivity (NPC) are rarely observed. Here, the discovery in PbSe0.5Te0.5 of superconductivity and photoconductivity transitions between positive photoconductivity (PPC) and NPC during compression is reported to &#8776;40&#160;GPa and subsequent decompression, which are also accompanied by reversible structure transitions (3D Fm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m &#8652; 2D Pnma &#8652; 3D Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m). Superconductivity with a maximum Tc of &#8776;6.7 K coincides with NPC and structure transition of Pnma to Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m at &#8776;18&#160;GPa and the latter phase is preserved down to &#8776;5&#160;GPa with enhanced Tc of &#8776;6.9 K during decompression. The observations imply the simultaneous superconducting and photoconductive transitions are closely related to the metallic Pm3&#175;${{\bar{3}}}$m phase. First&#8208;principles calculations suggest the enhanced p&#8208;p hybridization and charge transfer between Pb&#8208;5p and ligand&#8208;p orbitals near the Fermi surface play key roles in electron&#8208;phonon interaction of mediating the Cooper pairs in PbSe0.5Te0.5. Hall coefficient measurements reveal that photothermal effect enhances electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which decreases carrier concentration and mobility and results in the reversal of PPC&#8208;NPC. Structure&#8208;dependent superconductivity and NPC are jointly mediated by electron&#8208;phonon interplay, which is tunable through illumination or cooling at high&#8208;pressure. The findings shed light on the origin of superconductive and photoconductive transitions in versatile materials of lead chalcogenides.

         <title>Matching P&#8208; and N&#8208;type Organic Electrochemical Transistor Performance Enables a Record High&#8208;gain Complementary Inverter</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A &#8220;smart&#8221; n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains that forms a more ordered assembly when electrochemically doped, is reported along with a newly synthesized p&#8208;type conjugated polymer. The n&#8208;type and p&#8208;type polymers complement each other perfectly to construct an organic complementary inverter, achieving a record voltage gain of 307 VV&#8722;1.








Abstract
The charge transport of channel materials in n&#8208;type organic electrochemical transistors (OECTs) is greatly limited by the adverse effects of electrochemical doping, posing a long&#8208;standing puzzle for the community. Herein, an&#160;n&#8208;type conjugated polymer with glycolated side chains (n&#8208;PT3) is introduced. This polymer can adapt to electrochemical doping and create more organized nanostructures, mitigating the adverse effects of electrochemical doping. This unique characteristic gives n&#8208;PT3 excellent charge transport in the doped state and reversible ion storage, making it highly suitable as an n&#8208;type organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conducting (OMIEC) material. n&#8208;PT3 exhibits a high electron mobility of &#181; &#8776; 1.0 cm2 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1 and a figure of merit value of &#181;C* &#8776; 100 F cm&#8722;1 V&#8722;1 s&#8722;1, representing one of the best results for n&#8208;type OMIEC materials. A new p&#8208;type OMIEC polymer has been synthesized as the channel material for constructing a complementary inverter to match the n&#8208;type OECT channel layer based on n&#8208;PT3. As a result, a voltage gain value of up to 307 VV&#8722;1 has been achieved, which is a record value for sub&#8722;1&#160;V complementary inverters based on OECTs. This work offers valuable insights into designing electrochemical doping adaptive n&#8208;type OMIEC materials and fabricating high&#8208;gain organic complementary inverters.

         <title>Guided and Space Waves Multiplexed Metasurface for Advanced Electromagnetic Functionalities in Microwave Region</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A class of metasurfaces capable of multiplexing guided and space waves is proposed to achieve advanced EM functionalities in microwave regions, which can find great application potentials in radar systems, wireless communications, and wireless power transfer. The findings significantly expand the capabilities of metasurfaces in manipulating EM waves and stimulate advanced multifunctional meta devices facing more challenging and diversified application demands.








Abstract
Nowadays, metasurfaces have attracted considerable attention due to their promising and advanced control of electromagnetic (EM) waves. However, it is still challenging to shape guided waves into desired free&#8208;space mode, while simultaneously manipulating spatial incident waves using a single metasurface. Herein, a class of metasurfaces capable of multiplexing guided and space waves is proposed to achieve advanced EM functionalities in microwave regions, which can find great application potentials in radar systems, wireless communications, and wireless power transfer (WPT). The proposed metasurface, composed of specially designed meta&#8208;atoms with polarization&#8208;dependent radiation and reflection properties, provides the capability to fully manipulate complex amplitude of guided waves and reflection phase of space incident wave independently and simultaneously, thus enabling arbitrary radiation and reflection functionalities without encountering crosstalk issues. As examples of potential applications, three advanced EM functionalities operating in both far&#8208;field and near&#8208;field regions are presented: low&#8208;sidelobe microwave antenna with reduced radar cross section (RCS), multifunctional WPT, and feed multiplexed holograms, respectively. The far&#8208;field characteristics of the low sidelobe level antennas showing radiated beams at &#177;&#160;30&#176; together with RCS reduction under arbitrarily polarized incidences are validated by both simulations and measurements. A good agreement between experiments and simulations is also observed for the near&#8208;field intensity distribution of the hologram, which further validates the feasibility of near&#8208;field shaping. The findings significantly expand the capabilities of metasurfaces in manipulating EM waves and stimulate advanced multifunctional metadevices facing more challenging and diversified application demands.

However, it encounters challenges such as inadequate drug accumulation and limited efficacy against &#8220;cold&#8221; tumors characterized by lack of T cell infiltration and immunosuppressive microenvironments. Here, a controlled antibody production and releasing nanoparticle (CAPRN) is introduced, designed to augment ICB efficacy by facilitating tumor&#8208;targeted antibody production and inducing photodynamic cell death. CAPRN achieves tumor&#8208;specific accumulation via pH&#8208;responsive PEG detachment, enabling efficient intracellular gene delivery encoding anti&#8208;PD&#8208;L1 antibody. Laser&#8208;induced photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only triggers cancer cell death but also facilitates targeted antibody release from dying tumor cells. CAPRN demonstrates significant anti&#8208;tumor efficacy, attributed to multiple effects including enhanced antibody release, dendritic cell (DC) maturation, and T cell activation. Moreover, CAPRN exhibits substantial tumor suppression in both primary and bilateral tumor models, accompanied by activated T cell infiltration and enhanced immune responses. This study presents a novel strategy for priming robust immunotherapy, offering targeted antibody release through laser&#8208;assisted photodynamic nanoparticles.

         <title>Unveiling the Oxidation Mechanisms of High&#8208;entropy Carbides Through Atomic&#8208;scale Dynamic Observation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C high&#8208;entropy carbide nanoparticles during oxidation is tracked in situ by using an environmental aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key oxidation stages are discerned at the atomic level: i) increased amorphization (300&#8211;500 &#176;C); ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered oxide nanoclusters (500&#8211;800 &#176;C); and iii) final one&#8208;step crystallization of high&#8208;entropy oxides.








Abstract
Understanding the behavior of high&#8208;entropy carbides (HECs) under oxygen&#8208;containing environments is of particular importance for their promising applications in structural components, catalysis, and energy&#8208;related fields. Herein, the structural evolution of (Ta, Ti, Cr, Nb)C (HEC&#8208;1) nanoparticles (NPs) is tracked in situ during the oxidation at the atomic scale by using an open&#8208;cell environmental aberration&#8208;corrected scanning transmission electron microscope. Three key stages are clearly discerned during the oxidation of HEC&#8208;1 NPs at the atomic level below 900 &#176;C: i) increased amorphization of HEC&#8208;1 NPs from 300 to 500 &#176;C due to the energetically favorable formation of carbon vacancies and substitution of carbon with oxygen atoms; ii) nucleation and subsequent growth of locally ordered nanocluster intermediates within the generated amorphous oxides from 500 to 800 &#176;C; and iii) final one&#8208;step crystallization of non&#8208;equimolar MeO2 and Me2O5 (Me = metallic elements, Ta, Ti, Cr, and Nb) high&#8208;entropy oxides above 800 &#176;C, accompanied with the reduction in atomic defects. This result is further confirmed by theoretical calculations that these observed high&#8208;entropy oxide phases are thermodynamically preferable to generate above 830 &#176;C. The study provides direct evidence of the ordered&#8211;disordered&#8211;ordered structural transition of HECs during oxidation.

         <title>A Separator with Double Layers Individually Modified by LiAlO2 Solid Electrolyte and Conductive Carbon for High&#8208;performance Lithium&#8211;Sulfur Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The charge transfer resistance of Li&#8211;S using the modified separator is reduced. In addition, there is no corrosion and the lithium anode is dendrite&#8208;free. The &#8216;shuttle effect&#8217; of polysulfides is greatly suppressed.








Abstract
The &#8220;shuttle effect&#8221; and the unchecked growth of lithium dendrites during operation in lithium&#8211;sulfur (Li&#8211;S) batteries seriously impact their practical applications. Besides, the performances of Li&#8211;S batteries at high current densities and sulfur loadings hold the key to bridge the gap between laboratory research and practical applications. To address the above issues and facilitate the practical utilization of Li&#8211;S batteries, the commercial separator is modified with solid electrolyte (nanorod LiAlO2, LAO) and conductive carbon (Super P) to obtain a double coated separator (SPLAOMS). The SPLAOMS can physically barrier polysulfides and accelerate reaction kinetics. In addition, it enhances uniform lithium deposition, boosts ionic conductivity, and increases the utilization of active sulfur substances. The prepared Li&#8211;S batteries exhibit excellent cycling stability under harsh conditions (high sulfur loadings and high current densities) with an initial capacity of 733 mAh g&#8722;1 and a capacity attenuation of 0.03% per cycle at 5C in 500 cycle life. Under ultra&#8208;high sulfur loading (8.2&#160;mg cm&#8722;2), the prepared battery maintains a satisfactory capacity of 800 mAh g&#8722;1 during cycling, demonstrating enormous commercial application potential. This study serves as a pivotal reference for the commercialization of high&#8208;performance Li&#8211;S batteries.

Abstract
High contact resistance remains the primary obstacle that hinders further advancements of organic semiconductors (OSCs) in electronic circuits. While significant effort has been directed toward lowering the energy barrier at OSC/metal contact interfaces, approaches toward reducing another major contributor to overall contact resistance &#8211; the bulk resistance &#8211; have been limited to minimizing the thickness of OSC films. However, the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane conductivity of OSCs, a critical aspect of bulk resistance, has largely remained unaddressed. In this study, multi&#8208;layered 2D crystalline, solution&#8208;processed films of the high&#8208;mobility molecular semiconductor 2,9&#8208;dioctylnaphtho[2,3&#8208;b] naphtha[2&#8242;,3&#8242;:4,5]thieno[2,3&#8208;d]thiophene (C8&#8208;DNTT&#8208;C8) are investigated using conductive&#8208;probe atomic force microscopy (C&#8208;AFM) to evaluate out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport. The findings reveal a linear increase in out&#8208;of&#8208;plane resistance with the number of molecular layers in the film, which is modeled using an equivalent circuit model with multiple tunneling barriers connected in series. Building upon these results, a vertical transfer length method (V&#8208;TLM) is developed, allowing one to determine the out&#8208;of&#8208;plane resistivity of OSC and providing insights into charge transport properties at a single molecule length scale. The V&#8208;TLM approach highlights the potential of C&#8208;AFM for investigating out&#8208;of&#8208;plane charge transport in OSC thin films and holds promise for accelerating the screening of molecules for high&#8208;performance electronic devices.

         <title>Stabilizing the Fe Species of Nickel&#8208;Iron Double Hydroxide via Chelating Asymmetric Aldehyde&#8208;Containing THB Ligand for Long&#8208;Lasting Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stabilization of Fe species is achieved through the chelation of asymmetric aldehyde&#8208;containing ligand THB, which enhances OER performance of NiFeOOH/THB in long&#8208;lasting overall water splitting by suppressing the dissolution of Fe and facilitating the rapid formation of highly valent active Fe (III) species.








Abstract
Nickel&#8208;iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long&#8208;term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation.

     alt="Stabilizing the Fe Species of Nickel-Iron Double Hydroxide via Chelating Asymmetric Aldehyde-Containing THB Ligand for Long-Lasting Water Oxidation"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The stabilization of Fe species is achieved through the chelation of asymmetric aldehyde-containing ligand THB, which enhances OER performance of NiFeOOH/THB in long-lasting overall water splitting by suppressing the dissolution of Fe and facilitating the rapid formation of highly valent active Fe (III) species.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nickel-iron layered double hydroxides (NiFe LDHs) are considered as promising substitutes for precious metals in oxygen evolution reaction (OER). However, most of the reported NiFe LDHs suffer from poor long-term stability because of the Fe loss during OER resulting in severe inactivation. Herein, a dynamically stable chelating interface through in situ transformation of asymmetric aldehyde-ligand (THB, 1,3,5-Tris(3&#8242;-hydroxy-4&#8242;-formylphenyl)-benzene) modified NiFe LDHs to anchor Fe and significantly enhance the OER stability is reported. The fabricated asymmetric aldehyde-containing ligand THB is capable of stimulating much more interfacial charge transfer from NiFe LDHs to the oxygen group of THB and accelerating the formation of highly valent active Fe species leading to the strong combination between Fe and ligand and the reduced activation energy barrier of the intermediate, respectively. The optimized aldehyde-ligand-chelated NiFe LDHs (NiFe LDH/THB) shows enhanced OER performance featuring an overpotential of 224&#160;mV at 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; and robust stability for over 3860&#160;h at 100&#160;mA cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; in a water splitting device maintaining a cell voltage of only 1.68&#160;V, which paves a new avenue to improve the water electrolysis performance of non-noble metal catalysts.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Novel Selectivity: Target of Gas Sensing Defined by Behavior</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The selectivity of the sensing material can be expressed through the idiosyncratic behavior of the gas sensing process, meanwhile, the identification of the target gas becomes more accurate.








Abstract
Traditional selectivity of gas sensors determined by the magnitude of the response value has significant limitations. The distinctive inversion sensing behavior not only defies the traditional sensing theory but also provides insight into defining selectivity. Herein, the novel definition of selectivity is established in a study with VO2(M1). The sensing behavior of VO2(M1) is investigated after its synthesis conditions optimization by machine learning. In gases of the same nature, VO2(M1) shows remarkably selective for NH3 marked with unique resistance increase behavior. Such anomalous behavior is attributed to the formation of the Schottky junction between VO2(M1) and the electrode. The &#8220;work function&#8208;electron affinity&#8221; relation is summarized as the selectivity coefficient, a parameter for predicting the selectivity of the sensing material effectively.

         <title>Operando Studies Redirect Spatiotemporal Restructuration of Model Coordinated Oxides in Electrochemical Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For the first time, a suite of advanced surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk operando characterizations and systematic computations are combined to successfully establish a link between oxygen&#8208;evolving performance and operational spatiotemporal behaviors on model&#8208;coordinated oxides during electrochemical oxidation. The underlying catalysis mechanism and activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off are further revealed and solved in electrode and device.








Abstract
Tetrahedral, pyramidal, and octahedral metal&#8208;oxygen coordinated ligands are fundamental components in all metal&#8208;oxide structures. Understanding the impacts of their spatiotemporal behaviors during electrochemical oxidation is crucial for diverse applications, yet remains unsolved due to challenges in designing model oxides and conducting operando characterizations. Herein, combining a suite of advanced operando characterizations and systematic computations, a link between oxygen&#8208;evolving performance and operational structural properties is established on model oxides. Compared with tetrahedral and octahedral structures, pyramidal structure is more susceptible to OH&#8722; attack due to its pristine unsaturated and asymmetric features and constant single&#8208;electron occupancy on the active z2 orbital during reaction, leading to surface&#8208;to&#8208;bulk restructuration into active amorphous high&#8208;valence CoOOHx with edge&#8208;sharing configurations. This is accompanied by ion leaching to create nanoscale space, following a leaching tendency of Sr2+ &gt; Ba2+ &gt; La3+ &gt; Y3+. Operando soft X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy demonstrates a harder non&#8208;uniform dehydrogenation process over time (Co3+OOH &#8594; Co3+/4+OOHx &#8594; Co4+OO) because of the enhanced Co&#63743;O covalency with higher energy barriers. Lattice oxygen participates in active CoOOHx formation but sacrifices stability. To address this activity&#8208;stability trade&#8208;off, an ion&#8208;tuning strategy is proposed to simultaneously enhance both activity and stability in electrode and device.

         <title>In Operando Locally&#8208;Resolved Photophysics in Perovskite Solar Cells by Correlation Clustering Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Correlation clustering imaging (CLIM) exploits local intensity fluctuations observed by fluorescence microscopy in metal&#8208;halide perovskite films and their solar cells to generate novel contrasts uncovering the spatial dynamics of charge carrier transport, recombination losses, and material restructuring.








Abstract
The instability of metal halide perovskites limits the commercialization of solar cells despite their impressive efficiencies. This instability, driven by photo&#8208;induced ion migration, leads to material restructuring, defect formation, degradation, and defect healing. However, these same &#8220;unwanted&#8221; properties enable to propose Correlation Clustering Imaging (CLIM), a technique that detects local photoluminescence (PL) fluctuations through wide&#8208;field fluorescence microscopy. It is shown that such fluctuations are present in high&#8208;quality perovskites and their corresponding solar cells. CLIM successfully visualizes the polycrystalline grain structure in perovskite films, closely matching electron microscopy images. The analysis of fluctuations reveals a dominant metastable defect responsible for the fluctuations. In solar cells in short&#8208;circuit conditions, these fluctuations are significantly larger, and corresponding correlated regions extend up to 10 micrometers, compared to 2 micrometers in films. It is proposed that the regions resolved by CLIM in solar cells possess a common pool of charge extraction channels, which fluctuate and cause PL to vary. Since PL fluctuations reflect non&#8208;radiative recombination processes, CLIM provides valuable insights into the structural and functional dynamics of carrier transport, ion migration, defect behavior, and recombination losses. CLIM offers a non&#8208;invasive approach to understanding luminescent materials and devices in operando, utilizing contrasts based on previously untapped properties.

         <title>The Critical Isomerization Effect of Core Bromination on Nonfullerene Acceptors in Achieving High&#8208;Performance Organic Solar Cells with Low Energy Loss</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The precise bromination of the quinoxaline&#8208;fused core affords two isomeric nonfullerene acceptors, contributing to improved electronic and aggregation structures. AQx&#8208;22&#8208;based devices exhibit a superior PCE of 19.5% with a high open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.97&#160;V and the lowest energy loss of 0.476&#160;eV reported to date for binary OSCs. Such an isomerization strategy shows great promise for developing next&#8208;generation high&#8208;performance OSCs.








Abstract
Highly efficient nonfullerene acceptors (NFAs) for organic solar cells (OSCs) with low energy loss (Eloss) and favorable morphology are critical for breaking the efficiency bottleneck and achieving commercial applications of OSCs. In this work, quinoxaline&#8208;based NFAs are designed and synthesized using a synergistic isomerization and bromination approach. The &#960;&#8208;expanded quinoxaline&#8208;fused core exhibits different bromination sites for isomeric NFAs, namely AQx&#8208;21 and AQx&#8208;22. Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the isomerization effect of core bromination significantly influences molecular intrinsic properties, including electrostatic potentials, polarizability, dielectric constant, exciton binding energy, crystallinity, and miscibility with donor materials, thereby improving molecular packing and bulk&#8208;heterojunction morphology. Consequently, the AQx&#8208;22&#8208;based blend exhibits enhanced crystallinity, reduced domain size, and optimized phase distribution, which facilitates charge transport, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. The AQx&#8208;22&#8208;treated OSCs obtain an impressive efficiency of 19.5% with a remarkable open&#8208;circuit voltage of 0.970&#160;V and a low Eloss of 0.476&#160;eV. This study provides deep insights into NFA design and elucidates the potential working mechanisms for optimizing morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of core bromination, highlighting its significance in advancing OSC technology.

Theoretical and experimental analyses reveal that the isomerization effect of core bromination significantly influences molecular intrinsic properties, including electrostatic potentials, polarizability, dielectric constant, exciton binding energy, crystallinity, and miscibility with donor materials, thereby improving molecular packing and bulk-heterojunction morphology. Consequently, the AQx-22-based blend exhibits enhanced crystallinity, reduced domain size, and optimized phase distribution, which facilitates charge transport, suppresses charge recombination, and improves charge extraction. The AQx-22-treated OSCs obtain an impressive efficiency of 19.5% with a remarkable open-circuit voltage of 0.970&#160;V and a low &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;loss&lt;/sub&gt; of 0.476&#160;eV. This study provides deep insights into NFA design and elucidates the potential working mechanisms for optimizing morphology and device performance through isomerization engineering of core bromination, highlighting its significance in advancing OSC technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Decoupling the Effects of Interface Chemical Degradation and Mechanical Cracking in Solid&#8208;State Batteries with Silicon Electrode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Silicon's high capacity and dendrite suppression potential make it a promising negative electrode in solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs), yet cycling stability remains an issue. This study reveals that mechanical cracking, rather than chemical degradation, drives increased resistance in Si/Li6PS5Cl electrodes. Small&#8208;grained Li6PS5Cl improves microstructural stability, reducing cracks and enhancing cycling performance, providing insights for better silicon&#8208;based SSBs.








Abstract
Silicon is a promising negative electrode material for solid&#8208;state batteries (SSBs) due to its high specific capacity and ability to prevent lithium dendrite formation. However, SSBs with silicon electrodes currently suffer from poor cycling stability, despite chemical engineering efforts. This study investigates the cycling failure mechanism of composite Si/Li6PS5Cl electrodes by decoupling the effects of interface chemical degradation and mechanical cracking. Chlorine&#8208;rich Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5 suppresses interface chemical degradation when paired with silicon, while small&#8208;grained Li6PS5Cl shows 4.3&#8208;fold increase of interface resistance due to large Si/Li6PS5Cl contact area for interface degradation. Despite this, small&#8208;grained Li6PS5Cl improves the microstructure homogeneity of the electrode composites, effectively alleviating the stress accumulation caused by the expansion/shrinkage of silicon particles. This minimizes bulk cracks in Li6PS5Cl during the lithiation processes and interface delamination during the delithiation processes. Mechanical cracking shows a dominant role in increasing interface resistance than interface chemical degradation. Therefore, electrodes with small&#8208;grained Li6PS5Cl show better cycling stability than those with Li5.5PS4.5Cl1.5. This work not only provides an approach to decouple the complex effects for cycling failure analysis but also provides a guideline for better use of silicon in negative electrodes of SSBs.

         <title>Interface Storage Mechanism in Aqueous Ammonium&#8208;Ion Supercapacitors with Keggin&#8208;Type Polyoxometalates&#8208;Modified Ag&#8208;BTC</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
{PMo12} and {PW12}, which possess many metal&#8208;Ox active sites, have been used as aqueous ammonium&#8208;ion supercapacitor materials to achieve extremely high&#8208;activity charge storage through a surface&#8208;interface energy storage mechanism. Supercapacitor devices assembles with the same energy storage mechanism but different redox potential electrode materials for the positive and negative electrodes can attain ultrahigh energy density and effectively enhance stability.








Abstract
Ammonium&#8208;ion supercapacitors (AISCs) offer considerable potential for future development owing to their low cost, high safety, environmental sustainability, and efficient electrochemical energy storage capabilities. The rapid and efficient charge&#8208;transfer process at the AISC can endow them with high capacitive and cycling stabilities. However, the prolonged intercalation/deintercalation of NH4+ in layered and framework materials often results in the cleavage of the active sites and the deconstruction of the framework, which makes it difficult to achieve long&#8208;term stable energy storage while maintaining high capacitance in the electrode materials. Herein, highly redox&#8208;active polyoxometalates (POMs) modified [Ag3(&#181;&#8208;Hbtc)(&#181;&#8208;H2btc)]n (Ag&#8208;BTC) is used as electrode materials. POMs effectively promote the pseudocapacitance storage of NH4+ through a similar interface storage mechanism. At a current density of 1 A g&#8722;1, {PMo12}@Ag&#8208;BTC exhibited a specific capacitance of 619.4 mAh g&#8722;1 and retained 100% of its capacitance after 20,000 charge&#8211;discharge cycles. An asymmetrical battery with {PMo12}@Ag&#8208;BTC and {PW12}@Ag&#8208;BTC as positive and negative electrode materials, respectively, achieved an energy density of 125.3 Wh kg&#8722;1. The interface&#8208;capacitance process enables the full utilization of metal&#8208;Ox (x = b, c, t) sites within the POMs, significantly enhancing charge storage. This study emphasizes the considerable potential of POM&#8208;based electrode materials for NH4+ intercalation/deintercalation energy storage.

         <title>Highly Efficient Monolithic Perovskite/TOPCon Silicon Tandem Solar Cells Enabled by &#8220;Halide Locking&#8221;</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This paper reported a &#8220;Halide Locking&#8221; strategy to balance the crystalline rate of iodide and bromide anions on the rough silicon substrates, inducing the formation of homogenous and oriented perovskite crystal structure. The single&#8208;junction devices yield the highest VOC of 1.277 V, and monolithic perovskite/TOPCon silicon tandem devices enable the record efficiency of 31.32% with improved light stability.








Abstract
Perovskite/silicon tandem solar cells (TSCs) are promising candidates for commercialization due to their outstanding power conversion efficiencies (PCEs). However, controlling the crystallization process and alleviating the phases/composition inhomogeneity represent a considerable challenge for perovskite layers grown on rough silicon substrates, ultimately limiting the efficiency and stability of TSC. Here, this study reports a &#8220;halide locking&#8221; strategy that simultaneously modulates the nucleation and crystal growth process of wide bandgap perovskites by introducing a multifunctional ammonium salt, thioacetylacetamide hydrochloride (TAACl), to bind with all types of cations and anions in the mixed halide perovskite precursor. The approach not only enables excellent compositional uniformity in the wet&#8208;film stage but also induces preferred orientation along the (001) plane following nucleation, leading to enhanced homogeneity of the perovskite film in both vertical and horizontal directions over long&#8208;length scales. The resulting wide&#8208;bandgap perovskite solar cells yield exceptional open&#8208;circuit voltage&#8208;fill factor products (VOC &#215; FF) of 1.074 and 1.040 in small&#8208; (0.0414 cm2) and large&#8208;area (1.0208 cm2) devices, respectively. Corresponding large&#8208;area tandem solar cells based on the Tunnel Oxide Passivated Contact (TOPCon) silicon subcells achieve a record PCE of 31.32% with a remarkable VOC of 1.931&#160;V and FF of 81.54%.

         <title>Coherent&#8208;Precipitation&#8208;Stabilized Phase Formation in Over&#8208;Stoichiometric Rocksalt&#8208;Type Li Superionic Conductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The phase formation mechanisms of the over&#8208;stoichiometric rocksalt&#8208;type Li superionic conductor are systematically investigated. The spinel&#8208;like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the cation&#8208;disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling, preventing decomposition into equilibrium phases and kinetically trapping the metastable face&#8208;sharing configurations. The ionic conductivity is further optimized to 1.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&#8722;1 at room temperature through low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;annealing.








Abstract

&lt;p&gt;The phase formation mechanisms of the over-stoichiometric rocksalt-type Li superionic conductor are systematically investigated. The spinel-like phase with unconventional stoichiometry forms as coherent precipitate from the cation-disordered rocksalt phase upon fast cooling, preventing decomposition into equilibrium phases and kinetically trapping the metastable face-sharing configurations. The ionic conductivity is further optimized to 1.45&#160;mS&#160;cm&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; at room temperature through low-temperature post-annealing.

         <title>Angstrom&#8208;Scale Defect&#8208;Free Crystalline Membrane for Sieving Small Organic Molecules</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Re&#8208;designing the metal source to eliminate cluster&#8208;missing defects and then adding extra ligands to heal the linker&#8208;missing defects realize the construction of angstrom&#8208;scale defect&#8208;free MOF membranes. The MOF membrane with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice aperture shows an outstanding molecular sieving performance toward organic azeotropic mixtures, surpassing the upper&#8208;bound of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art membranes.








Abstract
Crystalline membranes, represented by the metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) with well&#8208;defined angstrom&#8208;sized apertures, have shown great potential for molecular separation. Nevertheless, it remains a challenge to separate small molecules with very similar molecular size differences due to angstrom&#8208;scale defects during membrane formation. Herein, a stepwise assembling strategy is reported for constructing MOF membranes with intrinsic angstrom&#8208;sized lattice aperture lattice to separate organic azeotropic mixtures separation. The membrane is synthesized by redesigning the metal source, which reduces the coordination reaction rate to avoid cluster&#8208;missing defects. Then, extra ligands are introduced to overcome the coordination steric hindrance to heal the linker&#8208;missing defects. Ultralow&#8208;dose transmission electron microscopy is used to realize a direct observation of the angstrom&#8208;scale defects. For separating the challenging methanol&#8208;containing ester or ether azeotropic mixtures with molecular size difference as small as &lt;1 &#197;, the angstrom&#8208;scale defect&#8208;free MOF membrane exhibits an outstanding flux of &#8776;3700 g&#183;m&#8722;2&#160;h&#8722;1 and separation factor of &#8776;247&#8211;524, far beyond the upper&#8208;bound of state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;arts membranes. This study offers a feasible strategy for precisely constructing angstrom&#8208;confined spaces for diverse applications (e.g., separation, catalysis, and storage).

         <title>Bipolar Modulation in a Self&#8208;Powered Ultra&#8208;Wide Photodetector Based on Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb Heterojunction for Wavelength&#8208;Sensitive Imaging and Encrypted Optical Communication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work constructs a wavelength&#8208;dependent, bipolarity&#8208;modulated self&#8208;powered ultra&#8208;wide Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction photodetector (PD) with a response range of 250&#8211;1900&#160;nm, achieving a detectivity&#160;greater than 1010 Jones across the entire spectrum under zero bias. It also enables high&#8208;contrast broad&#8208;spectrum imaging and high&#8208;encryption optical communication.








Abstract
Broadband photodetectors (PDs) have garnered significant attention due to their ability to detect optical signals across a wide wavelength range, with applications spanning military reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and medical imaging. However, existing broadband detectors face several practical challenges, including limited detection range, uneven photoresponse, and difficult to distinguish multispectral signals. To address these limitations, this study presents a self&#8208;powered ultra&#8208;wide PD based on the Bi2Se3/AlInAsSb heterojunction. The device can detect signals across a wide wavelength range from 250&#160;nm to 1900&#160;nm, exhibiting outstanding optoelectronic performance with a maximum responsivity of 0.5 A&#160;W&#8722;1, a detectivity of 4.2 &#215; 1012 Jones, a switching ratio of 1.1 &#215; 104, and an external quantum efficiency of 71.4%. Furthermore, the detector achieves a detectivity greater than 1010 Jones across the entire broadband range, significantly improving photoresponse uniformity. Notably, due to the differential band alignment of the two materials across spectral ranges, this detector exhibits a photocurrent polarity reversal in the 650&#8211;680&#160;nm range. Leveraging its broadband and bipolar characteristics, this PD successfully enables secure information encryption in communication systems. This study significantly advances broadband PD technology, enhancing its practical uses and introducing innovative solutions for secure communications, thus strengthening communication security and confidentiality.

Abstract
By manipulating their asymmetric electronic spin states, the unique electronic structures and unsaturated coordination environments of single atoms can be effectively harnessed to control their magnetic properties. In this research, the first investigation is presented into the regulation of magnetic properties through the electronic spin states of single atoms. Magnetic single&#8208;atom one&#8208;dimensional materials, M&#8208;N&#8208;C/ZrO2 (M = Fe, Co, Ni), with varying electronic spin states, are design and synthesize based on the electronic orbital structure model. The SAs 3d electron spin structure of the composite M&#8208;N&#8208;C modulates the magneto physical properties and triggers a unique natural resonance loss, which achieves a controllable tuning of the effective absorption band under low&#8208;frequency conditions. The minimum reflection loss (RLmin) of M&#8208;N&#8208;C can reach &#8208;69.71&#160;dB, and the effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) ratio is as high as 91% (2&#8211;18&#160;GHz). The current work provides a path toward achieving controllable modulation of low&#8208;frequency electromagnetic wave bands by exploring the mechanism through which atomic and even electronic level interactions influence magnetic modulation.

         <title>A Critical Perspective on Photothermal De&#8208;Icing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 7, February 19, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of three distinct photothermal mechanisms. It discusses recent advancements in photothermal de&#8208;icing and elucidates key challenges in their application. Through a detailed presentation of a comparative dataset and critical insights, valuable guidance is provided for future research, particularly in the strategic selection of materials and structure designs, to advance practical de&#8208;icing solutions in real&#8208;world applications.








Abstract
To tackle the formidable challenges posed by extreme cold weather events, significant advancements have been made in developing functional surfaces capable of efficiently removing accreted ice. Nevertheless, many of these surfaces still require external energy input, such as electrical power, which raises concerns regarding their alignment with global sustainability goals. Over the past decade, increasing attention has been directed toward photothermal surface designs that harness solar energy&#8722;a resource available on Earth in quantities exceeding the total reserves of coal and oil combined. By converting solar energy into heat, these designs enable the transformation of the interfacial solid&#8208;solid contact (ice&#8208;substrate) into a liquid&#8208;solid contact (water&#8208;substrate), significantly reducing interfacial adhesion and facilitating rapid ice removal.

     alt="A Critical Perspective on Photothermal De-Icing"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This perspective provides a comprehensive overview of three distinct photothermal mechanisms. It discusses recent advancements in photothermal de-icing and elucidates key challenges in their application. Through a detailed presentation of a comparative dataset and critical insights, valuable guidance is provided for future research, particularly in the strategic selection of materials and structure designs, to advance practical de-icing solutions in real-world applications.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To tackle the formidable challenges posed by extreme cold weather events, significant advancements have been made in developing functional surfaces capable of efficiently removing accreted ice. Nevertheless, many of these surfaces still require external energy input, such as electrical power, which raises concerns regarding their alignment with global sustainability goals. Over the past decade, increasing attention has been directed toward photothermal surface designs that harness solar energy&#8722;a resource available on Earth in quantities exceeding the total reserves of coal and oil combined. By converting solar energy into heat, these designs enable the transformation of the interfacial solid-solid contact (ice-substrate) into a liquid-solid contact (water-substrate), significantly reducing interfacial adhesion and facilitating rapid ice removal. This critical perspective begins by emphasizing the advantages of photothermal design over traditional de-icing methods. It then delves into an in-depth analysis of three primary photothermal mechanisms, examining how these principles have expanded the scope of de-icing technologies and contributed to advancements in photothermal surface design. Finally, key fundamental and technical challenges are identified, offering strategic guidelines for future research aimed at enabling practical, real-world applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Enhanced Nanocatalysts Trigger Neutrophil N1 Polarization against Bacterial Biofilm by Disrupting Redox Homeostasis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The strategy of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signaling provides an emerging strategy for anti&#8208;infective treatment. Here, the MOF nanocatalytic system induces a strong antibacterial response by triggering redox homeostasis imbalance in both of the bacteria and neutrophils, and initiate neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment.








Abstract
Strategies of manipulating redox signaling molecules to inhibit or activate immune signals have revolutionized therapeutics involving reactive oxygen species (ROS). However, certain diseases with dual resistance barriers to the attacks by both ROS and immune cells, such as bacterial biofilm infections of medical implants, are difficult to eradicate by a single exogenous oxidative stimulus due to the diversity and complexity of the redox species involved. Here, this work demonstrates that metal&#8208;organic framework (MOF) nanoparticles capable of disrupting the bacterial ROS&#8208;defense system can dismantle bacterial redox resistance and induce potent antimicrobial immune responses in a mouse model of surgical implant infection by simultaneously modulating redox homeostasis and initiating neutrophil N1 polarization in the infection microenvironment. Mechanistically, the piezoelectrically enhanced MOF triggers ROS production by tilting the band structure and acts synergistically with the aurintricarboxylic acid loaded within the MOF, which inhibits the activity of the cystathionine &#947;&#8208;cleaving enzyme. This leads to biofilm structure disruption and antigen exposure through homeostatic imbalance and synergistic activation of neutrophil N1 polarization signals. Thus, this study provides an alternative but promising strategy for the treatment of antibiotic&#8208;resistant biofilm infections.

         <title>Trace Adsorptive Removal of PFAS from Water by Optimizing the UiO&#8208;66 MOF Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Using a prototypal platform of metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) and polymer&#8211;MOF hybrid sorbents, an optimal combination of surface hydrophobicity and strong electrostatics enables &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal of per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), with record&#8208;high kinetics and efficient sorbent regeneration. The expendable nature of guest&#8208;accessible porosity for PFAS removal is established, underpinning a counterintuitive perspective on future adsorbent design.








Abstract
The confluence of pervasiveness, bioaccumulation, and toxicity in freshwater contaminants presents an environmental threat second to none. Exemplifying this trifecta, per&#8208; and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) present an alarming hazard among the emerging contaminants. State&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art PFAS adsorbents used in drinking water treatment, namely, activated carbons and ion&#8208;exchange resins, are handicapped by low adsorption capacity, competitive adsorption, and/or slow kinetics. To overcome these shortcomings, metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs) with tailored pore size, surface, and pore chemistry are promising alternatives. Thanks to the compositional modularity of MOFs and polymer&#8211;MOF composites, herein we report on a series of water&#8208;stable zirconium carboxylate MOFs and their low&#8208;cost polymer&#8208;grafted composites as C8&#8211;PFAS adsorbents with benchmark kinetics and &#8220;parts per billion&#8221; removal efficiencies. Bespoke insights into the structure&#8211;function relationships of PFAS adsorbents are obtained by leveraging interfacial design principles on solid sorbents, creating a synergy between the extrinsic particle surfaces and intrinsic molecular building blocks.

Multimodal Sensing Ionogels
In article number 2414663, Chen Xu, Shengqiang Bai, Ziqi Liang, and coworkers demonstrat the multimodal sensing capabilities of a paradigm ionogel, [EMIM][TFSI]/PVDF&#8211;HFP. Under applied temperature and pressure fields, the iongel exhibits piezoelectric (PE) augmented ionic thermoelectric (iTE) properties, where ion transport is modulated by a PE&#8208;induced internal field. Such dual&#8208;stimuli sensitivity, coupled with iTE&#8208;based humidity responsiveness, holds great potential for clinical applications. It can effectively monitor vital signs such as blood pressure, cardiac function, and blood loss from wounds.

Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives our understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations. More details can be found in article number 2415981 by Jeroen Leijten and co&#8208;workers.

Epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 Spirals
In article number 2413926, Yi&#8208;Hsien Lee and his colleagues demonstrate scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals. An intertwined charge density wave (CDW)&#8208;Mott appears with a commensurate CDW phase at room temperature. Modulated interlayer spacing effectively manipulates interlayer interactions, which opens a new avenue toward tunable collective properties in spiral 2D lattices.

Biofilm Eradication
In article number 2409633, Min Ge, Chuang Yang, Han Lin, Jianlin Shi, and co&#8208;workers developed a physical and chemical barrier breakthrough strategy for biofilms via redox homeostasis manipulation. The nanosystem can enhance the attack of ROS via exogenous stimulation while providing interference with endogenous H2S synthase to reduce the resistance of reducing species, which together lead to severe structural damage in biofilms. In addition, oxidative stress mediates N1 polarization of neutrophils, leading to immunobactericidal effects.

This review presents a comprehensive overview of the cutting&#8208;edge research and potential applications of machine learning in the field of solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials, including mechanism mining, high&#8208;throughput design, and scale&#8208;up assembly application, outlining a roadmap for more efficient and environmentally friendly energy storage solutions.








Abstract
Machine learning (ML) has emerged as a pioneering tool in advancing the research application of high&#8208;performance solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage materials (HSMs). This review summarizes the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art research of ML in resolving crucial issues such as low hydrogen storage capacity and unfavorable de&#8208;/hydrogenation cycling conditions. First, the datasets, feature descriptors, and prevalent ML models tailored for HSMs are described. Specific examples include the successful application of ML in titanium&#8208;based, rare&#8208;earth&#8208;based, solid solution, magnesium&#8208;based, and complex HSMs, showcasing its role in exploiting composition&#8211;structure&#8211;property relationships and designing novel HSMs for specific applications. One of the representative ML works is the single&#8208;phase Ti&#8208;based HSM with superior cost&#8208;effective and comprehensive properties, tailored to fuel cell hydrogen feeding system at ambient temperature and pressure through high&#8208;throughput composition&#8208;performance scanning. More importantly, this review also identifies and critically analyzes the key challenges faced by ML in this domain, including poor data quality and availability, and the balance between model interpretability and accuracy, together with feasible countermeasures suggested to ameliorate these problems. In summary, this work outlines a roadmap for enhancing ML's utilization in solid&#8208;state hydrogen storage research, promoting more efficient and sustainable energy storage solutions.

This review summarizes the pressure&#8208;related challenges and strategies for ASSBs and offers perspectives on how to reduce fabrication and operation pressure. The insights aim to guide the design of low&#8208;pressure ASSBs, thus facilitating their practical application.








Abstract
All&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are regarded as promising next&#8208;generation energy storage technology owing to their inherent safety and high theoretical energy density. However, achieving and maintaining solid&#8211;solid electronic and ionic contact in ASSBs generally requires high&#8208;pressure fabrication and high&#8208;pressure operation, posing substantial challenges for large&#8208;scale production and application. In recent years, significant efforts are made to address these pressure&#8208;related challenges. In this review, the impact of pressure on ASSBs is explored. First, the categories, origins, and challenges associated with pressure in ASSBs are outlined. Second, an overview of recent advancements in addressing pressure&#8208;related issues in ASSBs is provided, focusing on electrode materials and their interfaces with various solid&#8208;state electrolytes (SSEs). Third, advanced characterizations and simulations employed to unravel the intricate electrochemical&#8211;mechanical interactions in ASSBs are examined. Finally, existing strategies and the insights on achieving low&#8208;stack&#8208;pressure ASSBs are presented.

         <title>Substrate&#8208;Free Inorganic&#8208;Based Films for Thermoelectric Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based thermoelectric thin films demonstrate excellent adaptability to curved surfaces and deliver high output performance, making them a promising solution for thermal management and energy harvesting in portable electronics. This review summarizes their fabrication methods, strategies for property enhancement, and applications in power generation and cooling, while highlighting remaining challenges and proposing directions for future research.








Abstract
The development of highly integrated electronic components and the Internet of Things demands efficient thermal management and uninterrupted energy harvesting, which provides exciting opportunities for thermoelectric (TE) technology since it allows direct conversion between electricity and thermal energy. The improved output performance of TE devices has traditionally been driven by advancements in inorganic materials. Recently, there has been growing interest in studying substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE thin films because they provide improved adherence to curved surfaces and offer a more compact size compared to the corresponding rigid form of these materials. This review begins by summarizing various methods for fabricating freestanding inorganic&#8208;based TE films, including leveraging the intrinsic plasticity of certain materials, exfoliating layered&#8208;structure materials, using sacrificial substrates, and creating composites with flexible components such as polymers and carbon&#8208;based materials. A key challenge in achieving high device performance is determining how to maintain the favorable TE properties of inorganic materials. This can be addressed through strategies such as high inorganic content loading, multicomponent engineering, and interfacial structure design. The review also discusses the applications of substrate&#8208;free inorganic&#8208;based TE devices in both power generation and solid&#8208;state cooling. Finally, it outlines current challenges and proposes potential research directions to further advance the field.

         <title>Orbital Current Pumping From Ultrafast Light&#8208;driven Antiferromagnetic Insulator</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 via terahertz emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. This phenomenon occurs when the magnonic orbital moment of the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 is excited by the ultrafast laser, resulting in the pumping of orbital current into Pt/CuOx interface. 








Abstract
The orbital Hall effect originating from light materials with weak spin&#8208;orbit coupling, has attracted considerable interest in spintronic applications. Recent studies demonstrate that orbital currents can be generated from charge currents through the orbital Hall effect in ferromagnetic materials. However, the generation of orbital currents in antiferromagnets has so far been elusive. In this work, this is experimentally observed that the generation of orbital currents from orbital dynamics in the antiferromagnetic insulator &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3 via terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy, a phenomenon known as orbital pumping. A significant increase in THz signal is obtained in &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Pt/CuOx heterostructure compared to that of &#945;&#8208;Fe2O3/Pt, with the maximum value occurring at a Pt thickness of 2&#160;nm. The enhancement of the THz signal is attributed to the fact that magnons injected into Pt excite a coupled spin&#8208;orbital current that flows toward the Pt/CuOx interface, aside from the spin&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion in the Pt layer. The magnetoresistance contains the conventional spin&#8208;Hall magnetoresistance contributed by the Pt layer and an additional orbital contribution from the Pt/CuOx interface. The Pt/CuOx interface generates an orbital current and absorbs the orbital accumulation, similar to the orbital&#8208;Hall magnetoresistance. This finding provides a rich platform for orbital&#8208;to&#8208;charge conversion and opens an interdisciplinary field of antiferromagnetic orbitronics.

         <title>In Situ Programmable, Active, and Interactive Crystallization by Localized Polymerization</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Based on deterministic characteristics in the structuring of materials via additive manufacturing, crystals can be grown in an active and interactive manner, which realizes spatiotemporal programming and reprogramming of crystals. In the present study, snowflake&#8208;like camphor crystals are demonstrated with their real&#8208;time seeding and reprogramming via in situ, localized photopolymerization of mixture systems, which launches an era of active crystallization.









Abstract
Additive manufacturing has sought active and interactive means of creating predictable structures with diverse materials. Compared to such active manufacturing tools, current crystallization strategies remain in statistical and passive programs of crystals via macroscale thermodynamic controllers, commonly lacking active means to intervene in crystal growth in a spatiotemporal manner. Herein, a strategy toward active and interactive programming and reprogramming of crystals, realized by real&#8208;time tangible feedback on growing crystals by delicately controlling the degree of in&#8208;situ, localized photopolymerization of polymeric structures via additive manufacturing is presented. Using this strategy, crystals can be seeded, guided, and even reprogrammed in a supersaturated liquid resin. In principle, the localized formation of sparse polymeric networks within supercooled resins can induce density fluctuation to trigger seed nucleation instantaneously, whereas the formation of dense networks can lower molecules&#8217; mobilities to inhibit crystal growth. Assisted by these active triggers and deterministic procedural aspects in additive manufacturing, growing crystals can be tangibly interacted through programmed polymeric structures, strengthening deterministic characteristics in crystal growth. It is suggested that crystal growth can be programmable with deterministic hierarchies within the created crystal's morphologies within the background of inherent stochasticity in crystallization, launching an era of convolutional growth of crystals.

         <title>Scintillating Glass Fiber Arrays Enable Remote Radiation Detection and Pixelated Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Perovskite quantum dots with efficient scintillating luminescence are incorporated in glass fibers with low&#8208;loss waveguiding, enabling remote, real&#8208;time radiation detection. More importantly, the scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array with controlled thickness and length for use in remote pixilated X&#8208;ray imaging.








Abstract
The emerging metal halide perovskites are challenging the traditional scintillators in the field of radiation detection and radiography. However, they lack the capability for remote and real&#8208;time radiation monitoring and imaging in confined and hostile conditions. To address this issue, details on an inorganic scintillating glass fiber incorporating perovskite quantum dots (QDs) as highly efficient pixelated radiation emitters are reported, while the glass fibers themselves serve at the same time as low&#8208;loss waveguides, enabling long&#8208;distance and underwater X&#8208;ray detection. The multi&#8208;color emissions and controllable radiation sensitivities endow CsPbX3 (X = Cl, Br, I) QD scintillating glass fibers with the potential as wearable and visualized radiation indicators. Furthermore, these scintillating glass fibers can be regularly arranged into a fiber array plate with a thickness of 7.5&#160;mm to enhance X&#8208;ray absorption for X&#8208;ray imaging. Leveraging the light&#8208;guiding character of glass fibers, a 5 &#215; 5 fiber array with fiber lengths up to 11&#160;cm has demonstrated the potential of remote pixelated X&#8208;ray imaging. This study offers a novel platform for the development of remote detectors and imagers for X&#8208;ray radiation.

MXene has garnered growing interest in the field of electrochemistry, thanks to its unique electrical and surface characteristics. Nonetheless, significant challenges persist in realizing its full potential in chemoresistive sensing applications. In this study, a novel unidirectional freeze&#8208;casting approach for fabricating a Poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS)&#8208;facilitated vertically aligned MXene&#8208;based aerogel with enhanced chemoresistive sensing properties was introduced. Firstly, the persistent challenge of poor gelation in MXene was addressed by formulating a nanohybrid of MXene and PEDOT:PSS, which acted as flexible conductive nanobinder. Employing a unique freeze&#8208;casting method, MXene flakes interconnected by PEDOT:PSS, were stabilized into a flexible, vertically aligned structure, leading to maximum surface exposure and enhanced robustness. The resulting 3&#8208;dimentional (3&#8208;D) aerogel exhibited a fast, heightened chemoresistive response of 7 to 50 parts per million (ppm) acetone and expanded the working range to between 10 parts per billion (ppb)&#8208;8000 ppm. Interfacial heterostructures formed between MXene and PEDOT:PSS, provided active sites, reduced activation energy, and enhanced selectivity. Modulated MXene bandgap, and its electron mobility further facilitated electron transfer, and enhanced signal strength. The sensor showed excellent biocompatibility and was also successfully employed as a breathalyzing tool, for on&#8208;demand alcohol consumption monitoring.

         <title>Low Thermal Conductivity and Diffusivity at High Temperatures Using Stable High&#8208;Entropy Spinel Oxide Nanoparticles</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Low thermal diffusivity at high temperature (800 &#176;C) is achieved using packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations with low thermal conductivity and relatively high packing density of &#8776;50 %. The high entropy leads to remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures, thus enabling the low thermal conductivity of the packed nanoparticles.








Abstract
The realization of low thermal conductivity at high temperatures (0.11&#160;W m&#8722;1 K&#8722;1 800 &#176;C) in ambient air in a porous solid thermal insulation material, using stable packed nanoparticles of high&#8208;entropy spinel oxide with 8 cations (HESO&#8208;8 NPs) with a relatively high packing density of &#8776;50%, is reported. The high&#8208;density HESO&#8208;8 NP pellets possess around 1000&#8208;fold lower thermal diffusivity than that of air, resulting in much slower heat propagation when subjected to a transient heat flux. The low thermal conductivity and diffusivity are realized by suppressing all three modes of heat transfer, namely solid conduction, gas conduction, and thermal radiation, via stable nanoconstriction and infrared&#8208;absorbing nature of the HESO&#8208;8 NPs, which are enabled by remarkable microstructural stability against coarsening at high temperatures due to the high entropy. This work can elucidate the design of the next&#8208;generation high&#8208;temperature thermal insulation materials using high&#8208;entropy ceramic nanostructures.

         <title>HClO&#8208;Activated Near&#8208;Infrared Chemiluminescent Probes with a Malononitrile Group for In&#8208;Vivo Imaging</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Eight chemiluminescence (CL) probes with a malononitrile group are easily synthesized by introducing donors to regulate HClO&#8208;activated CL emissions from 600 to 750&#160;nm, with comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations supporting a concerted decomposition of the oxidized CL molecule, achieving high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation in vivo with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;background ratio (SBR) of 24.77.









Abstract
Chemiluminescence (CL)&#160;imaging has emerged as a powerful approach to molecular imaging that allows exceptional sensitivity with virtually no background interference because of its unique capacity to emit photons without an external excitation source. Despite its high potential, the application of this nascent technique faces challenges because the current chemiluminescent agents have limited reactive sites, require complex synthesis, are insufficiently bright, and lack near&#8208;infrared emission. Herein, a series of HClO&#8208;activated chemiluminescent probes that exhibit robust near&#8208;infrared emission are studied. Specifically engineered to respond to HClO, a known biomarker of acute inflammation, these probes achieve high&#8208;contrast in vivo imaging by eliminating the need for constant external excitation. Comprehensive experimental and theoretical investigations demonstrate that the CL of the probes depends on the reactivity of the vinylene bonds, following a concerted decomposition of the oxidized chemiluminescent molecule. The application of these chemiluminescent nanoparticles in vivo facilitates high&#8208;contrast imaging of acute inflammation, providing real&#8208;time, high&#8208;contrast visualization of inflammatory conditions. This advancement signifies a leap forward for chemiluminescent nanoplatforms in biomedical imaging and expands the available methodologies in this field.

         <title>Nanoelectrode&#8208;Mediated Extracellular Electrical Stimulation Directing Dopaminergic Neuronal Differentiation of Stem Cells for Improved Parkinson's Disease Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wireless nanoelectrodes made of electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are anchored to the membrane of neural stem cells to enable their migration together with the cells and precise extracellular electrical stimulation to the membrane receptors under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation promotes the differentiation of stem cells into specifical dopaminergic neurons and improves the repair of Parkinson's disease mice.








Abstract
Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease caused by the dysfunction and death of dopaminergic neurons. Neural&#8208;stem&#8208;cell (NSC)&#8208;based therapy is a promising approach for the treatment of PD but its therapeutic performance is limited by low efficiency of differentiation of NSCs to dopaminergic neurons. Although electrical stimulation can promote neuronal differentiation, it is not verified whether it can induce the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons. Meanwhile, it is a great challenge to precisely apply electrical stimulation to dynamically migrating NSCs after transplantation. Here, electrochemically exfoliated graphene nanosheets are designed to anchor to the membrane of NSCs to serve as wireless nanoelectrodes. After anchoring to the cell membrane, these nanoelectrodes are able to migrate together with the cells and precisely apply extracellular electrical stimulation to the receptors or ion transport channels on the membrane of transplanted cells under alternating magnetic field. The nanoelectrode&#8208;mediated electrical stimulation induces 38.46% of the NSCs to specifically differentiate into dopaminergic neurons, while the percentage is only 5.82% for NSCs without the nanoelectrode stimulation. Transplantation of NSCs anchored with the nanoelectrodes effectively improves the recovery of the motor and memory ability of PD mice under alternating magnetic field within 2 weeks.

         <title>Engineering Mild&#8208;Photothermal Responsive and NO Donor Prussian Blue Nanozymes Using Mild Synthesis for Inflammation Regulation and Bacterial Eradication in Periodontal Disease</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a mild strategy to synthesis of mild&#8208;photothermal responsive and NO donor Prussian blue nanozymes for inflammation regulation and bacterial eradication in periodontal disease.








Abstract
Periodontitis, an infectious disease of periodontal tissues caused by oral bacterial biofilms, is characterized by reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulation and immune microenvironment imbalance. Multifunctional nanozymes, leveraging their physiochemical properties and enzymatic activities, offer promising antibacterial and anti&#8208;inflammatory strategies for managing periodontitis. In particular, Prussian blue nanozymes (PBzymes) exhibit exceptional ROS control due to their robust catalytic activity, diverse antioxidant functions, and high biocompatibility. However, the practical application of traditional high&#8208;temperature synthesis methods is limited. This study introduces a class of metal&#8208;engineered PBzymes synthesized at room temperature, identified for their potent antioxidative activity and excellent photothermal performance at mild temperatures. Nitric oxide (NO) gas therapy offers promising strategies for targeting deep infections in periodontal tissues. Thus, sodium nitroprusside is introduced into PBzyme to create SPBzyme via an in situ loading method. NO release by SPBzyme enhances antibacterial effects and overcomes resistance linked to bacterial biofilms, resulting in mild&#8208;photothermal antibacterial properties and synergistic antioxidant effects. In vitro antibacterial assays demonstrate the superior efficacy of SPBzyme under mild temperature conditions and near&#8208;infrared light exposure. Furthermore, SPBzyme effectively reduces inflammation and has positive therapeutic effects in periodontal animal models. Overall, mild&#8208;temperature photothermal NO release nanozyme therapy represents a novel approach for treating periodontitis.

         <title>Polyanionic Electrolyte Ionization Desalination Empowers Continuous Solar Evaporation Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Polyanionic electrolyte ionization functionalisation via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer deposition as desalination strategy is implemented here to a localized thermal solar evaporator empowering continuous evaporation over extended periods of time and under real sweater from the Yellow Sea and from the East China Sea.








Abstract
Solar evaporation contributes to sustainable and environmentally friendly production of fresh water from seawater and wastewater. However, poor salt resistance and high degree of corrosion of traditional evaporators in brine make their implementation in real applications scarce. To overcome such deficiency, a polyanionic electrolyte functionalization strategy empowering excellent uniform desalination performance over extended periods of time is exploited. This 3D superhydrophilic graphene oxide solar evaporator design ensures stable water supply by the enhanced self&#8208;driving liquid capillarity and absorption at the evaporation interface as well as efficient vapor diffusion. Meanwhile, the polyanionic electrolyte functionalization implemented via layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer static deposition of polystyrene sodium sulfonate effectively regulates/minimizes the flux of salt ions by exploiting the Donnan equilibrium effect, which eventually hinders local salt crystallization during long&#8208;term operation. Stable evaporation rates in line with the literature of up to 1.68&#160;kg m&#8722;2 h&#8722;1 are achieved for up to 10 days in brine (15&#8240; salinity) and for up to 3 days in seawater from Hangzhou Bay in the East China Sea (9&#8240; salinity); while, maintaining evaporation efficiencies of &#8776;90%. This work demonstrates the excellent benefits of polyanionic electrolyte functionalization as salt resistance strategy for the development of high&#8208;performance solar powered seawater desalination technology and others.

         <title>Metaplasticity&#8208;Enabled Graphene Quantum Dot Devices for Mitigating Catastrophic Forgetting in Artificial Neural Networks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A two&#8208;terminal metaplastic resistive memory device is developed by combining graphene quantum dots (GQDs) with iron oxide (FeOx). This research contributes to the field of neuromorphic computing by providing a scalable and reconfigurable hardware solution that effectively integrates metaplasticity into artificial synaptic devices, addressing the problem of catastrophic forgetting in current neural network architectures.









Abstract
The limitations of deep neural networks in continuous learning stem from oversimplifying the complexities of biological neural circuits, often neglecting the dynamic balance between memory stability and learning plasticity. In this study, artificial synaptic devices enhanced with graphene quantum dots (GQDs) that exhibit metaplasticity is introduced, a higher&#8208;order form of synaptic plasticity that facilitates the dynamic regulation of memory and learning processes similar to those observed in biological systems. The GQDs&#8208;assisted devices utilize interface&#8208;mediated modifications in asymmetric conductive pathways, replicating classical synaptic plasticity mechanisms. This allows for repeatable and linearly programmable adjustments to future weight changes linked to historical weights. Incorporating metaplasticity is essential for achieving generalization within deep neural networks, which enables them to adapt more fluidly to new information while retaining previously acquired knowledge. The GQDs&#8208;device&#8208;based system achieved a 97% accuracy on the fourth MNIST dataset task, while consistently achieving performance levels above 94% on prior tasks. This performance substantiates the feasibility of directly transferring metaplasticity principles to deep neural networks, thereby addressing the challenges associated with catastrophic forgetting. These findings present a promising hardware solution for developing neuromorphic systems with robust and sustained learning capabilities that can effectively bridge the gap between artificial and biological neural networks.

         <title>A One&#8208;Stone&#8208;Two&#8211;Birds Strategy for Intervertebral Disc Repair: Constructing a Reductive Chelation Hydrogel to Mitigate Oxidative Stress and Promote Disc Matrix Reconstruction</title>

HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu is a new type of hydrogel formed by reducing crosslinking, which shows multi&#8208;functions such as injectable, self&#8208;healing, reactive oxygen species clearance, photothermal properties, and so on. The successful application of HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu in combination with mild photothermal therapy in the treatment of disc degeneration strongly proves its promising application potential.








Abstract
Intervertebral disc degeneration (IVDD) is characterized by fibrosis of nucleus pulposus (NP) cells and accelerated surrounding extracellular matrix catabolism. Bioactive hydrogels have shown significant potential in regulating cellular functions and tissue homeostasis. In this work, a dynamic hydrogel (HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu) is designed via the reductive chelation of hyaluronic acid grafted with thiourea (HA&#8208;NCSN) and Cu2+. The reductivity of the grafted thiourea groups of HA&#8208;NCSN can quickly reduce part of the chelated Cu2+ to Cu+. Therefore, during the gelation process, the color of hydrogel become dark immediately, which endowed hydrogel with remarkable photothermal effect. The abundant thiourea groups inside hydrogel can effectively scavenge reactive oxygen species to mitigate the inflammatory stress of NP cells. RNA sequencing analysis further reveals that glutathione signaling pathway is significantly altered. Meanwhile, mild photothermal therapy could activate the TGF&#8208;&#946;/Smad pathway in NP cells, promoting the expression and secretion of Aggrecan and Collagen II. Ultimately, the combined modulation of inflammation alleviation and matrix regeneration achieves the restoration of the structure and function of the damaged intervertebral disc, which is also strongly demonstrated by the in vivo animal experiments. All of these results demonstrate the great potential of the dynamic HA&#8208;NCSN/Cu hydrogel in IVDD treatment.

         <title>Personalized Multi&#8208;Epitope Nanovaccine Unlocks B Cell&#8208;Mediated Multiple Pathways of Antitumor Immunity</title>

An antigen&#8208;adjuvant spatiotemporally&#8208;synchronized multi&#8208;epitope nanovaccine, termed as CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti&#8208;CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. The nanovaccine improves the antibody&#8208;secreting and antigen&#8208;presenting abilities of B cells, providing a multi&#8208;pronged approach to activation of antitumor immune responses.








Abstract
B lymphocytes have emerged as an important immune&#8208;regulating target. Inoculation with tumor cell membrane&#8208;derived vaccines is a promising strategy to activate B cells, yet their efficiency is limited due to lack of costimulatory molecules. To amplify B cell responses against tumor, herein, a spatiotemporally&#8208;synchronized antigen&#8208;adjuvant integrated nanovaccine, termed as CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, is constructed by conjugating the immune stimulative CpG oligonucleotide and the anti&#8208;CD40 antibody (aCD40) onto the membrane vesicles derived from triple negative breast cancer cells. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 actively accumulates in lymph nodes and is effectively captured by antigen&#8208;presenting cells via the recognition of CD40 by aCD40. Tumor antigens on CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 bind to B cell receptors, providing the first stimulation signal for B cells. Meanwhile, the interaction between CpG/Toll like receptor and aCD40/CD40 provides superposed co&#8208;stimulation signals, improving the antibody&#8208;secreting and antigen&#8208;presenting abilities of B cells. The nanovaccine also stimulates dendritic cells to activate CD8+ T cells, and reprograms tumor associated macrophages. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40 activating humoral, cellular, and innate antitumor immunity achieves a tumor inhibition rate of 89.3%, which is further improved to 95.4% when combined with the anti&#8208;programmed death ligand 1 (PD&#8208;L1) antibody. CM&#8208;CpG&#8208;aCD40, as a personalized multi&#8208;epitope nanovaccine, paves the way for ushering the era of B cell&#8208;based immunotherapy.

         <title>Multiple Polarization States in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 Thin Films by Ferroelectric and Antiferroelectric Coupling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study demonstrates the three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 thin films with ferroelectric and antiferroelectric coupling, in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. By fully switching individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution, the long&#8208;sought reliable operation of 3&#8208;bit per cell are realized in the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 films, including high endurance, small device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation, and long data retention.








Abstract
HfO2&#8208;based multi&#8208;bit ferroelectric memory combines non&#8208;volatility, speed, and energy efficiency, rendering it a promising technology for massive data storage and processing. However, some challenges remain, notably polarization variation, high operation voltage, and poor endurance performance. Here we show Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 (x&#160;=&#160;0.65 to 0.75) thin films grown through sequential atomic layer deposition (ALD) of HfO2 and ZrO2 exhibiting three&#8208;step domain switching characteristic in the form of triple&#8208;peak coercive electric field (EC) distribution. This long&#8208;sought behavior shows nearly no changes even at up to 125&#160;&#176;C and after 1 &#215; 108 electric field cycling. By combining the electrical characterizations and integrated differential phase&#8208;contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (iDPC&#8208;STEM), we&#160;reveal that the triple&#8208;peak EC distribution is driven by the coupling of ferroelectric switching and reversible antiferroelectric&#8211;ferroelectric transition. We further demonstrate the 3&#8208;bit per cell operation of the Hf1&#8722;xZrxO2 capacitors with excellent device&#8208;to&#8208;device variation and long data retention,&#160;by the full switching of individual peaks in the triple&#8208;peak EC. The work represents a significant step in implementing reliable non&#8208;volatile multi&#8208;state ferroelectric devices.

         <title>A Library of Seed@High&#8208;Entropy&#8208;Alloy Core&#8211;shell Nanocrystals With Controlled Facets for Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A library of seed@high&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy core&#8211;shell nanocrystals with up to ten elements and well&#8208;defined facets are synthesized via seed&#8208;mediated growth. Several facet&#8208;dependent catalytic activities are identified in electrocatalysis and photocatalysis, with active sites determined by in situ X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory. This work advances facet engineering in a multi&#8208;elemental scope and unveils the potential for catalysis.








Abstract
High&#8208;entropy&#8208;alloy (HEA) nanocrystals hold immense potential for catalysis, offering virtually unlimited alloy combinations through the inclusion of at least five constituent elements in varying ratios. However, general and effective strategies for synthesizing libraries of HEA nanocrystals with controlled surface atomic structures remain scarce. In this study, a transferable strategy for developing a library of facet&#8208;controlled seed@HEA nanocrystals through seed&#8208;mediated growth is presented. The synthesis of seed@HEA core&#8211;shell nanocrystals incorporating up to ten different metallic elements, with control over the number of solid&#8208;solution HEA atomic layers is demonstrated. Epitaxial HEA growth on nanocrystal seeds with low&#8208;index and high&#8208;index facets leads to the formation of seed@HEA catalyst library with composition&#8208; and facet&#8208;dependent catalytic activities in both electrocatalysis and photocatalysis. In situ synchrotron X&#8208;ray absorption spectroscopy and density&#8208;functional theory calculations are employed to identify surface active sites of the HEA, rationalizing the high level of catalytic activities achieved. This work enables facet engineering in the multi&#8208;elemental chemical space and unveils the critical needs for their future development toward catalysis.

         <title>Photoimmunologic Therapy of Stubborn Biofilm via Inhibiting Bacteria Revival and Preventing Reinfection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer is developed for photoimmunologic therapy of stubborn biofilm. It not only downregulates the two&#8208;component system, quorum sensing, and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth, and accelerating wound healing but also triggers immunogenetic cell death to promote short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory enhancement for coping with secondary infections.








Abstract
Stubborn biofilm infections pose serious threats to public health. Clinical practices highly rely on mechanical debridement and antibiotics, which often fail and lead to persistent and recurrent infections. The main culprits are 1) persistent bacteria reviving, colonizing, and rejuvenating biofilms, and 2) secondary pathogen exposure, particularly in individuals with chronic diseases. Addressing how to inhibit persistent bacteria revival and prevent reinfection simultaneously is still a major challenge. Herein, an oligo&#8208;ethylene glycol&#8208;modified lipophilic cationic photosensitizer (PS), TBTCP&#8208;PEG7, is developed. It effectively eradicates Methicillin&#8208;Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) under light irradiation. Furthermore, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7&#8208;mediated photodynamic therapy (PDT) not only conquers stubborn biofilm infections by downregulating the two&#8208;component system (TCS), quorum sensing (QS), and virulence factors, thereby reducing intercellular communication, inhibiting persistent bacterial regrowth and biofilm remodeling but also prevents reinfection by upregulating heat shock protein&#8208;related genes to induce immunogenetic cell death (ICD) and establish immune memory. In vivo, TBTCP&#8208;PEG7 efficiently eradicates MRSA biofilm adhered to medical catheters, stimulates angiogenesis, reduces inflammatory factor expression, and accelerates wound healing. Furthermore, ICD promotes short&#8208;term immune and long&#8208;term immunological memory for coping with secondary infections. This two&#8208;pronged strategy not only effectively overcomes stubborn, persistent and recurrent biofilm infection, but also provides theoretical guidance for designing the next generation of antibacterial materials.

         <title>A Novel Deer Antler&#8208;Inspired Bone Graft Triggers Rapid Bone Regeneration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Inspired by the rapid regeneration of antlers, HAMA hydrogel as a carrier for incorporating EVsABPCs into antler&#8208;DCB is utilized. Notably, the antler&#8208;DCB@EVsABPCs showed a strong ability to recruit endogenous BMSCs and transformed them an ABPC&#8208;like cells, thereby facilitating rapid bone formation. Additionally, the bone graft triggered bone growth coordinated with angiogenesis, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation, which partially imitating early phase antlerogenesis.








Abstract
Adult mammals are unable to regenerate bulky bone tissues, making large bone defects clinically challenging. Deer antler represents an exception to this rule, exhibiting the fastest bony growth in mammals, offering a unique opportunity to explore novel strategies for rapid bone regeneration. Here, a bone graft exploiting the biochemical, biophysical, and structural characteristics of antlers is constructed. It is decellularized antler cancellous bone (antler&#8208;DCB) to obtain a bone scaffold. Then, an antler&#8208;based bone graft is constructed by integrating antler&#8208;DCB with antler&#8208;derived biological signals, delivered by extracellular vesicles (EVs) from antler blastema progenitor cells (ABPCs), a novel stem cells responsible for antlerogenesis is discovered. The antler&#8208;based bone graft transformed bone marrow stromal cells into cells with an ABPC&#8208;like phenotype and transcriptomic signature. In vivo, the antler&#8208;based graft triggered rapid bone formation in a rat model, with doubled volume of newly formed bones than commercial DCBs. In addition, the antler&#8208;based graft orchestrated a coordinated process of vascularization, neurogenesis, and immunomodulation during osteogenesis, partially imitating early antlerogenesis. These findings provide practical insights to develop a therapeutic intervention for treating severe bone defects.

         <title>Stabilizing Electron Transport of 2D Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D materials are a potential candidate for beyond&#8208;silicon electronics. However, the stability is one of the key bottlenecks in the progress of 2D materials. Here, a strategy is developed that greatly improves the performance and stability of 2D materials and devices by using vitamin C. The increase in mobility is more than ten times, and the performance can be maintained in air conditions for more than 327 days.








Abstract
2D materials are promising candidates for beyond&#8208;Si electronic devices. However, their stability is a key bottleneck in their industrial applications. The instability of 2D materials is mainly attributed to their intrinsic susceptibility to O2 and H2O&#8212;particularly to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which have strong oxidizing properties. Inspired by the antioxidant effect of vitamin C (VC) in organisms, a strategy based on the use of VC to stabilize electron transport in 2D materials is developed, which significantly improves the performance and stability of these materials and devices. The mobility is increased by more than an order of magnitude, and excellent performance of the device is maintained in air for &gt;327 days, which is the best reported stability for MoS2 field&#8208;effect transistors to date. VC scavenges existing ROS via oxidation reactions and inhibits the generation of ROS by shielding excitons from oxygen quenching, which provides 2D materials lasting protection from electron trapping and oxidative damage, stabilizing electron transport. This approach, which is based on the simple utilization of readily available VC, has considerable potential for large&#8208;scale applications in the 2D material electronics industry.

         <title>Rationally Engineering Pro&#8208;Proteins and Membrane&#8208;Penetrating &#945;&#8209;Helical Polypeptides for Genome Editing Toward Choroidal Neovascularization Treatment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Adenosine triphosphate&#8208;tagged pro&#8208;proteins are engineered to form stable nanocomplexes with guanidyl&#8208;rich, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide and enable robust cytosolic delivery. By delivering ribonucleoprotein, this system induces pronounced genome editing against hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; after intravitreal injection, inhibiting neovascularization and subretinal fibrosis in choroidal neovascularization mice.









Abstract
Ribonucleoprotein (RNP)&#8208;based CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing holds great potential for the treatment of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which however, is challenged by the lack of efficient cytosolic protein delivery tools. Herein, reversibly&#8208;phosphorylated pro&#8208;proteins (P&#8208;proteins) with conjugated adenosine triphosphate (ATP) tags are engineered and coupled with a membrane&#8208;penetrating, guanidine&#8208;enriched, &#945;&#8208;helical polypeptide (LGP) to mediate robust and universal cytosolic delivery. LGP forms salt&#8208;stable nanocomplexes (NCs) with P&#8208;proteins via electrostatic interaction and salt bridging, and the helix&#8208;assisted, strong membrane activities of LGP enabled efficient cellular internalization and endolysosomal escape of NCs. Therefore, this approach allows efficient cytosolic delivery of a wide range of protein cargoes and maintains their bioactivities due to endolysosomal acidity&#8208;triggered traceless restoration of P&#8208;proteins. Notably, intravitreally delivered LGP/P&#8208;RNP NCs targeting hypoxia&#8208;inducible factor&#8208;1&#945; (HIF&#8208;1&#945;) induce pronounced gene disruption to downregulate pro&#8208;angiogenic factors and alleviate subretinal fibrosis, ultimately provoking robust therapeutic efficacy in CNV mice. Such a facile and versatile platform provides a powerful tool for cytosolic protein delivery and genome editing, and it holds promising potential for the treatment of CNV&#8208;associated diseases, such as age&#8208;related macular degeneration.

         <title>Ionic Diode&#8208;Based Drug Delivery System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is demonstrated, which uses electric potential for spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained drug release with minimal leakage. It provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. In a tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, it shows superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and reduced off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to intratumoral drug injection.








Abstract
Drug delivery systems hold promise for delivering cytotoxic drugs by controlling the timing and location of the drug release. However, conventional delivery mechanisms often fall short of achieving spatiotemporally controlled yet sustained release, which is crucial for ensuring drug efficacy and minimizing impact on surrounding tissues. Here, an ionic diode&#8208;based drug delivery system is reported that is controlled by an electric potential and capable of releasing drugs at scales ranging from nanogram to microgram. The migrated drug is slowly but continuously diffused to the lesion through the hydrogel at the desired rate. The ionic diode provides flow&#8208;free drug delivery while minimizing unintended drug leakage over prolonged periods. Implanted in a freely moving tumor&#8208;bearing mouse model, the system filled with doxorubicin demonstrated superior anti&#8208;tumor efficacy and minimal off&#8208;target immune toxicity compared to the intratumoral injection of free doxorubicin. With its mechanically compliant and biocompatible components, the system offers a safe and readily translatable approach to patients with surgically unresectable tumors.

         <title>Microwave&#8208;Powered Liquid Metal Degradation of Polyolefins</title>

         <dc:description>
The non&#8208;equilibrium microwave&#8208;powered liquid metal depolymerization is proposed for converting various polyolefin wastes into high&#8208;value olefin monomers and narrowband hydrocarbon oils by introducing. By leveraging the self&#8208;separation feature of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical&#8208;bond activation ability under microwave field, an unprecedented high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal&#8722;1 is achieved.








Abstract
Upcycling waste plastics is highly promising to tackle global white pollution while achieving sustainable development. However, prevailing approaches often encounter challenges in scalable engineering practices due to either insufficient plastic upcycling capability or arduousness in the separation, recovery, and purification of catalysts, which inevitably augments the cost of plastic upcycling. Here, the microwave&#8208;powered liquid metal synergetic depolymerization is presented to facilitate low&#8208;cost plastic upcycling. By leveraging the fluidity of liquid metals and their exceptional chemical&#8208;bond activation ability under microwave field, this method efficiently converts various polyolefins into narrowband hydrocarbon oil (Oil yield: 81 wt.% for polypropylene (PP), 85.9 wt.% for polyethylene (PE)) and high&#8208;value olefin monomers (C2&#8208;4&#63742; selectivity: 50% for PE, 65.3% for PP) over 30 successive cycles, resulting in a high turnover frequency of 2.83 kgPlastic mLLiquid metal&#8722;1. These captivating advantages offered by electromagnetically&#8208;powered liquid metals are also supported by their self&#8208;separation features, thereby paving the way for large&#8208;scale engineering solutions in waste plastic upcycling.

A novel acetamide&#8208;based eutectic electrolyte with enhanced solvation chemistry design, combined with a widened operation voltage range to induce hydrogen evolution reaction, forms a robust solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase layer, mitigating electron tunneling and significantly improving the cycle stability of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.








Abstract
Water is pursued as an electrolyte solvent for its non&#8208;flammable nature compared to traditional organic solvents, yet its narrow electrochemical stability window (ESW) limits its performance. Solvation chemistry design is widely adopted as the key to suppress the reactivity of water, thereby expanding the ESW. In this study, an acetamide&#8208;based ternary eutectic electrolyte achieved an ESW ranging from 1.4 to 5.1&#160;V. The electrolyte confines water molecules within the primary solvation sheath of Li&#8208;ions, reducing the free water and breaking the hydrogen bond network. Despite this, initial capacity retention is suboptimal due to inadequate formation of solid&#8208;electrolyte&#8208;interphase (SEI) layers. To address this, additional hydrogen evolution reaction is induced by widening the operation voltage range, thereby optimizing the SEI layer to mitigate the electron tunneling effect. This approach resulted in a denser LiF&#8208;rich SEI layer, effectively preventing water decomposition and improving long&#8208;term cycle stability. The optimized SEI layer reduced the electron tunneling barrier, achieving a discharge capacity of 152 mAh g&#8722;1 at 1 C and maintaining 76% of its capacity (116 mAh g&#8722;1) after 1000 cycles. This study highlights the critical role of both solvation structure and SEI layer optimization in enhancing the performance of high&#8208;voltage aqueous Li&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Personalized Vascularized Tumor Organoid&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;Chip for Tumor Metastasis and Therapeutic Targeting Assessment</title>

A vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoid (PDTO)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with a hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is developed, enabling high&#8208;resolution, real&#8208;time visualization of dynamic interactions within the tumor's perivascular niche. This platform effectively models tumor&#8208;driven angiogenesis and migration, highlighting its potential as a valuable tool for assessing metastatic risk and guiding clinical strategies.








Abstract
While tumor organoids have revolutionized cancer research by recapitulating the cellular architecture and behaviors of real tumors in vitro, their lack of functional vasculature hinders their attainment of full physiological capabilities. Current efforts to vascularize organoids are struggling to achieve well&#8208;defined vascular networks, mimicking the intricate hierarchy observed in vivo, which restricts the physiological relevance particularly for studying tumor progression and response to therapies targeting the tumor vasculature. An innovative vascularized patient&#8208;derived tumor organoids (PDTOs)&#8208;on&#8208;a&#8208;chip with hierarchical, tumor&#8208;specific microvasculature is presented, providing a versatile platform to explore tumor&#8208;vascular dynamics and antivascular drug efficacy. It is found that highly metastatic tumor cells induced vessel angiogenesis and simultaneously migrated toward blood vessels via the Notch pathway. The evident association between the angiogenic and migratory capacities of PDTOs and their clinical metastatic outcomes underscores the potential of the innovative platform for evaluating tumor metastasis, thus offering valuable insights for clinical decision&#8208;making. Ultimately, the system represents a promising avenue for advancing the understanding of tumor metastasis and developing personalized treatment strategies based on patient&#8208;specific tumor characteristics.

         <title>Accelerating the Electrochemical Formation of the &#948; Phase in Manganese&#8208;Rich Rocksalt Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A method of electrochemical pulsing which forms a spinel&#8208;like &#948; phase in Mn&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li&#8208;excess (DRX) (DRX) cathode materials is demonstrated. This concept is extended to large single&#8208;crystalline particles, greatly improving the cycling stability. X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM&#8208;HAADF were&#160;used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure separated by antiphase boundaries.









Abstract
Mn&#8208;rich disordered rocksalt materials with Li&#8208;excess (DRX) materials have emerged as a promising class of earth&#8208;abundant and energy&#8208;dense next&#8208;generation cathode materials for lithium&#8208;ion batteries. Recently, an electrochemical transformation to a spinel&#8208;like &#8220;&#948;&#8221; phase has been reported in Mn&#8208;rich DRX materials, with improved capacity, rate capability, and cycling stability compared with previous DRX compositions. However, this transformation unfolds slowly over the course of cycling, complicating the development and understanding of these materials. In this work, it is reported that the transformation of Mn&#8208;rich DRX materials to the promising &#948; phase can be promoted to occur much more rapidly by electrochemical pulsing at elevated temperature, rate, and voltage. To extend this concept, micron&#8208;sized single&#8208;crystal DRX particles are also transformed to the &#948; phase by the same method, possessing greatly improved cycling stability in the first demonstration of cycling for large, single&#8208;crystal DRX particles. To shed light on the formation and specific structure of the &#948; phase, X&#8208;ray diffraction, scanning electron nanodiffraction (SEND) and atomic resolution STEM&#8208;HAADF are used to reveal a nanodomain spinel structure with minimal remnant&#160;disorder.

         <title>Highly Stretchable 3D Microelectrode Array for Noninvasive Functional Evaluation of Cardiac Spheroids and Midbrain Organoids</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented, achieved through structural design of a non&#8208;stretching material and over&#8208;electrodeposition of PEDOT:PSS. sMEA enables tight contact with organoids despite exposure to buoyant force in medium, resulting in electrophysiological signals with a high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). High SNR signals allow for non&#8208;invasive functional assessment of the organoids for drug screening.








Abstract
Organoids are 3D biological models that recapitulate the complex structures and functions of human organs. Despite the rapid growth in the generation of organoids, in vitro assay tools are still limited to 2D forms. Thus, a comprehensive and continuous functional evaluation of the electrogenic organoids remains a challenge. Here, a highly stretchable 3D multielectrode array (sMEA) with protruding microelectrodes is presented for functional evaluation of electrogenic organoids. The optimized serpentine structures with bridge structures cover the surface of the organoids conformally even in immersion. The protruding microelectrodes form a stable contact with the organoids and allow electrophysiological recordings with high signal&#8208;to&#8208;noise ratio (SNR). sMEAs are fabricated in wafer&#8208;scale for repeatable, scalable, and mass production and packed into an easy&#8208;to&#8208;use, user&#8208;friendly, and robust microwell for fast dissemination of technology. The versatility of sMEA is validated by measuring electrophysiological signals from cardiac spheroids and midbrain organoids with a wide range of sizes from 500 to 1500&#160;&#181;m. Also, electrophysiological signals recorded with high SNR enable functional evaluation of the effects of drugs. The proposed sMEA with high SNR and user&#8208;friendly interface could be the key player in high&#8208;throughput drug screening, 3D spatiotemporal mapping of electrogenic organoids, and standardization of protocols for quality assessment.

         <title>Noble&#8208;Metal&#8208;Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half&#8208;reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H2 production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH3O&#8722;). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.








Abstract
Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo&#8208;generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble&#8208;metal&#8208;free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H2 yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo&#8208;generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H2 yield rate of 57.84 mmol gcat&#8722;1 h&#8722;1, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow&#8208;type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H2 yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min&#8722;1 and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation.

     alt="Noble-Metal-Free Cocatalysts Reinforcing Hole Consumption for Photocatalytic Hydrogen Evolution with Ultrahigh Apparent Quantum Efficiency"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Herein, a novel strategy is proposed that reinforces hole consumption to boost the oxidation half-reaction and ultimately the photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production. This is achieved by the rational design of noble-metal-free cocatalysts as efficient oxidative sites, promoting the generation of sacrificial agents (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;). Such a strategy can achieve a record apparent quantum efficiency of up to 65.8%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Achieving efficient and sustainable hydrogen production through photocatalysis is highly promising yet remains a significant challenge, especially when replacing costly noble metals with more abundant alternatives. Conversion efficiency with noble-metal-free alternatives is frequently limited by high charge recombination rates, mainly due to the sluggish transfer and inefficient consumption of photo-generated holes. To address these challenges, a rational design of noble-metal-free cocatalysts as oxidative sites is reported to facilitate hole consumption, leading to markedly increased H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rates without relying on expensive noble metals. By integrating femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy with in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations, the rapid hole consumption is compellingly confirmed, which in turn promotes the effective separation and migration of photo-generated carriers. The optimized catalyst delivers an impressive photocatalytic H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield rate of 57.84 mmol g&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; h&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;, coupled with an ultrahigh apparent quantum efficiency reaching up to 65.8%. Additionally, a flow-type quartz microreactor is assembled using the optimal catalyst thin film, which achieves a notable H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; yield efficiency of 0.102 mL min&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and maintains high stability over 1260 min of continuous operation. The strategy of reinforcing hole consumption through noble-metal-free cocatalysts establishes a promising pathway for scalable and economically viable solar H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Self&#8208;Adaptive Zwitterionic Polysilazane Coatings with Mechanical Robustness, High Transparency, and Broad&#8208;Spectrum Antiadhesion Properties</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel strategy for developing self&#8208;adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with excellent mechanical robustness and broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties is proposed. The developed coatings exhibits excellent wear resistance, good flexibility, strong adhesion, and high transparency as well as anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling properties. They have potential applications in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.








Abstract
Antiadhesive coatings have been extensively studied owing to their wide applications in biology, environment, and energy. However, developing a mechanically robust coating with broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties remains challenging. Herein, a novel strategy for preparing hard yet flexible and self&#8208;adaptive zwitterionic polysilazane coatings with broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesion properties (anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling) is proposed. The coatings are prepared by combining polysilazane with a telomer (FT) consisting of a low&#8208;surface&#8208;energy fluorine motif and hydrolysis&#8208;induced zwitterions. Before Si&#9472;OH generation in polysilazane, the fluorine motif drives the zwitterionic precursor to enrich on the surface, generating a zwitterionic layer following pre&#8208;hydrolysis. This unique design prevents the coatings from swelling in water, allowing them to adapt to diverse environments. The fluorine motif can orient toward the surface of air, providing anti&#8208;liquid adhesion capabilities, whereas the zwitterions orient underwater to endow anti&#8208;biofouling, anti&#8208;liquid adhesion, and anti&#8208;scaling capabilities. The highly cross&#8208;linked network toughened by FT contributes to the high hardness (up to 7H) and good flexibility of the coating. The chemical bonding between the coating and substrates ensures their strong adhesion (&#8776;2.06&#8211;7.67 MPa). This study contributes to the design of mechanically robust broad&#8208;spectrum antiadhesive coatings applicable in marine industries, optical devices, pipeline transportation, and other fields.

         <title>Popularizing Holistic High&#8208;Index Crystal Plane via Nonepitaxial Electrodeposition Toward Hydrogen&#8208;Embrittlement&#8208;Relieved Zn Anode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optimized electrodeposition dynamics help mitigate severe hydrodynamic fluctuations and hydrogen embrittlement issues, which not only refines the Zn deposition quality but also cultivates high&#8208;index Zn (112) texture, rendering durable Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Electrodeposition is promising to fabricate Zn electrodes affording nonepitaxial single&#8208;crystal textures. Previous research endeavors focus on achieving Zn(002) faceted deposition, nevertheless, the popularization of a high&#8208;index Zn plane with favorable electrochemical activity remains poorly explored. There also exists a deficiency in the assessment of the electrodeposited quality of Zn. Here, a straightforward strategy to address such concerns by cultivating predominant Zn(112) texture via a potentiostatic electrodeposition mode is reported. By precisely identifying the &#8220;limiting&#8221; conditions for electrodeposition, a striking balance between improved deposition quality, tailored deposition kinetics, and suppressed hydrogen evolution is found. (002) Faceted Zn electrode is shown that be indeed produced, yet the rampant hydrodynamic convection and hydrogen embrittlement issue under such &#8220;over&#8208;limiting&#8221; preparation conditions pose challenges in the electrode lifespan. In contrast, an optimized deposition minimizes hydrodynamic disturbances and mitigates the hydrogen embrittlement effect, where the thus&#8208;generated high&#8208;index (112)&#8208;textured Zn electrode manifests impressive deposition quality and demonstrates holistic cycling stability. The pouch cell by pairing a ZnxV2O5 (ZnVO) cathode manages a reversible capacity of &#8776;130&#160;mAh and a capacity retention of 98.42%. This study offers guidance for the development of dendrite&#8208;free and hydrogen&#8208;embrittlement&#8208;relieved Zn anodes, unleashing the potential of high&#8208;index plane textures for advanced Zn batteries.

         <title>An NIR&#8208;II Two&#8208;Photon Excitable AIE Photosensitizer for Precise and Efficient Treatment of Orthotopic Small&#8208;Size Glioblastoma</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Precise and efficient treatment of orthotopic small&#8208;size glioblastoma is realized in this work by fully taking advantage of two&#8208;photon excitation and an aggregation&#8208;induced emission photosensitizer. The proposed photosensitizer with a large two&#8208;photon absorption cross&#8208;section, the second near&#8208;infrared excitation, the first near&#8208;infrared emission, and prominent ROS generation, contributes to remarkable tumor growth inhibition and an ultra&#8208;deep imaging depth in the brain.








Abstract
The existence of residual small&#8208;size tumors after surgery is a major factor contributing to the high recurrence rate of glioblastoma (GBM). Conventional adjuvant therapeutics involving both chemotherapy and radiotherapy usually exhibit unsatisfactory efficacy and severe side effects. Recently, two&#8208;photon photodynamic therapy (TP&#8208;PDT), especially excited by the second near&#8208;infrared (NIR&#8208;II) light, offers an unprecedented opportunity to address this challenge, attributed to its combinational merits of PDT and TP excitation. However, this attempt has not been explored yet. On the other hand, the lack of high&#8208;performance photosensitizers (PSs) also hinders the progress of TP&#8208;PDT on GBM. Based on those, a robust TP&#8208;PS, termed MeTTh, is constructed intendedly through elaborately integrating multiple beneficial design strategies into a single molecule, which simultaneously achieves excellent NIR&#8208;II excitation, large absorption cross&#8208;section, aggregation&#8208;induced NIR&#8208;I emission, and prominent Type I/II reactive oxygen species generation. Aided by nanofabrication, an impressive brain structure imaging depth of 940&#160;&#181;m is realized. Moreover, MeTTh nanoparticles smoothly implement precise and efficient treatment of small&#8208;size GBM in vivo under a 1040&#160;nm femtosecond laser irradiation. This study represents first&#8208;in&#8208;class using TP&#8208;PDT on GBM, offering new insights for the therapy of small&#8208;size tumors in complex and vital tissues.

         <title>Intrinsic Localized Excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr Heterostructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The study indentifies localized excitons confined by substrate defects in the MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructure, thereby underscoring the pivotal role of intrinsic defects in modulating excitonic properties. Distinctive proximity&#8208;induced behaviors, including opposite valley polarization evolutions of MoSe2 excitons and novel in&#8208;plane anisotropic emissions, are reported. This work deepens the understanding of spectrally resolved proximity effects in magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.








Abstract
Despite extensive studies on magnetic proximity effects, the fundamental excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductor&#8208;magnet heterostructures remain elusive. Here, the presence of localized excitons in MoSe2/CrSBr heterostructures is unveiled, represented by a new photoluminescence emission feature, X*. Our findings reveal that X* originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects in the CrSBr layer. Additionally, the degrees of valley polarization of the X* and trion peaks exhibit opposite polarities under a magnetic field and closely correlate with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin&#8208;dependent charge transfer across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations which reveal a type&#8208;II band alignment. Furthermore, the strong in&#8208;plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization&#8208;dependent responses in MoSe2 emissions. This study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties and offers valuable insights into spectrally resolved proximity effects in semiconductor&#8208;magnet van der Waals&#160;heterostructures.

This work deepens the understanding of spectrally resolved proximity effects in magnetic van der Waals heterostructures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite extensive studies on magnetic proximity effects, the fundamental excitonic properties of the 2D semiconductor-magnet heterostructures remain elusive. Here, the presence of localized excitons in MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/CrSBr heterostructures is unveiled, represented by a new photoluminescence emission feature, X&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;. Our findings reveal that X&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; originates from excitons confined by intrinsic defects in the CrSBr layer. Additionally, the degrees of valley polarization of the X&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; and trion peaks exhibit opposite polarities under a magnetic field and closely correlate with the magnetic order of CrSBr. This is attributed to spin-dependent charge transfer across the heterointerface, supported by density functional theory calculations which reveal a type-II band alignment. Furthermore, the strong in-plane anisotropy of CrSBr induces unique polarization-dependent responses in MoSe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. This study highlights the crucial role of defects in shaping excitonic properties and offers valuable insights into spectrally resolved proximity effects in semiconductor-magnet van der Waals&#160;heterostructures.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

Thin film Diamond Like Carbon (DLC) on roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll gravure printing cylinders offers superior conductive ink transfer to flexible substrates compared to chrome. It enables fine lines and intricate structures for flexible electronics and security applications. DLC supports high&#8208;volume production of flexible microelectronics and micro&#8208;scale battery components, providing a more sustainable alternative to rigid electronics and reducing the carbon footprint.








Abstract
Diamond&#8208;Like Carbon (DLC), a thin&#8208;film material, is emerging as a promising alternative for durable surfaces due to its eco&#8208;friendly application process. This study evaluated the use of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface of gravure cylinders for roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing of fine&#8208;line electrodes and microtext patterns, specifically for applications in flexible electronics and graphics security. Results suggested that using thin film DLC on the wafer surface allows reliable reproduction of isometric grids and line structures with widths of 15, 20, and 30 &#181;m, as well as solid electrodes. The uniform conformity of thin&#8208;film DLC on the wafer surface, featuring an engraved micron&#8208;size cell structure, demonstrates superior ink transfer onto flexible PET (polyethylene terephthalate) substrates. This results in increased electrode line width and reduced electrical resistance compared to chrome. Statistical analysis confirmed the reliability and repeatability of the findings. Visual analysis of lines and microtext also demonstrated the reliable print&#8208;reproducing capabilities of DLC&#8208;coated surfaces. Overall, these results suggest that thin&#8208;film DLC is a promising alternative for use as a protective layer on gravure wafer surfaces. It has the potential to produce high&#8208;quality, high&#8208;volume electronics, such as sensors, antennas, and batteries, for applications in the Internet of Things (IoT) and other sustainable technologies.

         <title>Field&#8208;Induced Polarization Rotation in Order&#8211;Disorder (K,Na)NbO3&#8208;Based Ferroelectrics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A combination of advanced structural characterization at local and average scales and theoretical calculations reveals that the macroscopic rhombohedral&#8208;tetragonal phase coexistence of (K,Na)NbO3&#8208;based piezoceramics is essentially an average projection of collective local disordered units exhibiting the order&#8208;disorder behavior. The field&#8208;induced polarization rotation with a change in the degree of ordering is found to play a key role in boosting the functional properties of the investigated ferroelectrics.








Abstract
Phase boundary is highly recognized for its capability in engineering various physical properties of ferroelectrics. Here, field&#8208;induced polarization rotation is reported in a high&#8208;performance (K, Na)NbO3&#8208;based ferroelectric system at the rhombohedral&#8208;tetragonal phase boundary. First, the lattice structure is examined from both macroscopic and local scales, implementing Rietveld refinement and pair distribution function analysis, respectively. The macroscopic phase coexistence at the phase boundary can be interchangeably rationalized with an average projection of collective local disordered units, exhibiting the order&#8211;disorder nature. The structural evidence of field&#8208;induced polarization rotation is provided by the in situ synchrotron study. Theoretical studies including density functional theory calculation and molecular dynamics simulation also predict the polarization rotation mechanism. The simulation result reveals the variation of the degree of ordering during the polarization rotation as a key feature of the boosted electrical properties in the order&#8211;disorder ferroelectric system. The discovery provides meaningful insight into the design of ferroelectrics with enhanced physical properties.

         <title>Predesign of Covalent&#8208;Organic Frameworks for Efficient Photocatalytic Dehydrogenative Cross&#8208;Coupling Reaction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By utilizing anthracene and metalloporphyrin as the active components for the activation of oxygen and the catalysis of intramolecular cross&#8208;oxidation coupling reaction, respectively, a series of photosensitive and stable tandem heterogeneous COF catalysts are constructed for realizing the efficient photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An enables one&#8208;step, gram&#8208;scale photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones in a short time and under mild conditions.








Abstract
The dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reaction is the premier route for synthesizing important 4&#8208;quinazolinone drugs. However, it usually requires high reaction temperature and long reaction time, and the yield of the final product is low. Here two stable and photosensitive covalent&#8208;organic frameworks (COFs), TAPP&#8208;An and TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An are purposefully designed and constructed to serve as unprecedented heterogeneous tandem catalysts to complete dehydrogenative cross&#8208;coupling reactions in a short time and under mild reaction conditions (room temperature and light), leading to the high&#8208;efficient photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones. Particularly, TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An is the best heterogeneous catalyst currently available for the synthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones, even surpassing all the catalysts reported so far. It also enables one&#8208;step photosynthesis of 4&#8208;quinazolinones with higher conversion (&gt;99%) and selectivity (&gt;99%) in a shorter time, and the product can be easily prepared on a gram scale. Extensive experiments combined with theoretical calculations show that the excellent photogenerated charge separation and transport capability, as well as the synergistic An&#8208;Cu catalysis in TAPP&#8208;Cu&#8208;An are the main driving forces for this efficient reaction.

         <title>Coordination Regulation Enabling Deep Eutectic Electrolyte for Fast&#8208;Charging High&#8208;Voltage Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sulfonate&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) composed of prop&#8208;1&#8208;ene&#8208;1,3&#8208;sultone (PES) and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) without additional additives is developed. The unique Li+&#8722;PES&#8722;TFSI&#8722; coordination structure in the DEE facilitates rapid ion transport. Meanwhile, the strengthened &#945;&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thereby enabling the cycle stability of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials in lithium metal batteries.








Abstract
The safety and cycle stability of lithium metal batteries (LMBs) under conditions of high cut&#8208;off voltage and fast charging put forward higher requirements for electrolytes. Here, a sulfonate&#8208;based deep eutectic electrolyte (DEE) resulting from the eutectic effect between solid sultone and lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide without any other additives is reported. The intermolecular coordination effect triggers this eutectic phenomenon, as evidenced with nuclear magnetic resonance, and thus the electrochemical behavior of the DEE can be controlled by jointly regulating the coordination effects of F&#183;&#183;&#183;H and Li&#183;&#183;&#183;O intermolecular interactions. The DEE with a properly coordinated environment of Li+ presents a low motion barrier and a high transport rate of localized Li+, leading to a 10 C fast&#8208;charging LiFePO4||Li battery with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the strengthened &#945;&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thus enabling the cycle stability of high&#8208;capacity and high&#8208;voltage cathode materials in LMBs, e.g., a cycle stability at 4.5 V in the LiNi0.88Co0.07Mn0.05O2||Li battery with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 500 cycles, and an excellent compatibility in 4.5 V LiCoO2||Li and 4.8 V Li1.13Mn0.517Ni0.256Co0.097O2||Li batteries. The practical applicability of the carefully designed DEE is underscored through successful implementation in pouch cells.

The DEE with a properly coordinated environment of Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; presents a low motion barrier and a high transport rate of localized Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, leading to a 10 C fast-charging LiFePO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||Li battery with a capacity retention of 95.1% after 500 cycles. Meanwhile, the strengthened &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;&#8722;H&#183;&#183;&#183;F coordination broadens the electrochemical stability window of the DEE, thus enabling the cycle stability of high-capacity and high-voltage cathode materials in LMBs, e.g., a cycle stability at 4.5 V in the LiNi&lt;sub&gt;0.88&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.07&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.05&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li battery with a capacity retention of 81.0% after 500 cycles, and an excellent compatibility in 4.5 V LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li and 4.8 V Li&lt;sub&gt;1.13&lt;/sub&gt;Mn&lt;sub&gt;0.517&lt;/sub&gt;Ni&lt;sub&gt;0.256&lt;/sub&gt;Co&lt;sub&gt;0.097&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||Li batteries. The practical applicability of the carefully designed DEE is underscored through successful implementation in pouch cells.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Introducing La into a Customized Dual Cu Covalent Organic Framework to Steer CO2 Electroreduction Selectivity from C2H4 to CH4</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Customized multi&#8208;metal sites within covalent organic frameworks (COFs) offer a versatile platform for optimizing catalytic performance by precisely tuning metal composition based on their inherent properties. Specifically, the incorporation of oxophilic rare&#8208;earth La into the dual Cu COF steers CO2 electroreduction selectivity from C2H4 to CH4, which realizes the directional regulation of catalytic products.








Abstract
Customizing multi&#8208;metal site catalysts for achieving controllable CO2 reduction reaction (CO2RR) product tuning holds immense promise yet poses formidable challenges. The traditional synthesis method of multi&#8208;metal sites is the pyrolysis of metal&#8208;containing precursors, which is inherently uncontrollable. Herein, a bottom&#8208;up strategy is employed to customize and synthesize multi&#8208;metal sites in covalent organic frameworks&#160;(COFs), aiming to controllably switch the CO2 reduction selectivity by regulating the electronic structure of active sites. Briefly, La element provides chances for manipulating and finetuning the electronic structure of the customized dual Cu sites, and converts the main catalytic product of CO2RR from ethylene to methane. Density functional theory calculations show that the introduction of La alters the electronic structure around Cu, enhances CO2 and H2O activation, and changes the formation of energy barriers of key intermediates. To the best of the author's knowledge, this study constructed the first example of customized multi&#8208;metal site COF catalysts and provided new ideas for controllable modulation of products.

         <title>Low&#8208;Frequency Phonon Dispersion Relation Enabling Stable Cathode from Spent Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life. Local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, inhibits TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. The regenerated cathode exhibits good electrochemical performance.








Abstract
Direct recycling technology can effectively solve the environmental pollution and resource waste problems caused by spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, the repaired LiNi0.5Co0.2Mn0.3O2 (NCM) black mass by direct recycling technology shows an unsatisfactory cycle life, which is attributed to the formation of spinel/rock salt phases and rotational stacking faults caused by the in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane migration of transition metal (TM) atoms during charge/discharge. Herein, local lattice stress is introduced into the regenerated cathode during repair. The resulting stress gradient leads to the localization of the phonon mode and changes the phonon dispersion relation of materials, lowers the bending and stretching vibration frequencies of the TM&#9472;O covalent bond in cathode materials, and inhibits the TM atoms migration and the formation of defect structures. Beneficial from the favorable low&#8208;frequency phonon dispersion relation, the regenerated NCM represents remarkably enhanced structural stability during cycling, and exhibits good electrochemical performance. This reconstructed phonon dispersion relation approach broadens the perspective for lattice stress field engineering to suppress the defective structure raised from TM migration and paves the way for the development of regenerated cathodes with long durability.

         <title>Tunable Electron Correlation in Epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 Spirals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A highly modulated interlayer spacing is observed for the first time in the epitaxial 2D spirals with electron correlations. Scalable synthesis of the epitaxial TaS2 spirals is achieved with customized CVD reactions. An intertwined CDW&#8208;Mott state appears at room&#8208;temperature in the epitaxial 1T&#8208;TaS2 spirals, offering a platform to study collective properties at high temperatures.








Abstract

Tantalum disulfide (1T&#8208;TaS2), being a Mott insulator with strong electron correlation, is highlighted for diverse collective quantum states in the 2D lattice, including charge density wave (CDW), spin liquid, and unconventional superconductivity. The Mott physics embedded in the 2D triangular CDW lattice has raised debates on stacking&#8208;dependent properties because interlayer interactions are sensitive to van der Waals (vdW) spacing. However, control of interlayer distance remains a challenge. Here, spiral lattices in the epitaxial TaS2 spirals are studied to probe collective properties with tunable interlayer interactions. A scalable synthesis of epitaxial TaS2 spirals is presented. A more than 50%&#8208;increased interlayer spacing enables prototype decoupled monolayers for enhanced electronic correlation exhibiting Mott physics at room&#8208;temperature and a simplified system to explore collective properties in vdW materials.

Abstract
The spatiotemporal error caused by planar tiled structure design and the waste of communication resources brought on by the transmission of a single channel are two challenges facing the development of multifunctional intelligent sensors with high&#8208;density integration. A homo&#8208;spatiotemporal multisensory parallel transmission system (HMPTs) is expanded to realize multisignal no&#8208;spatiotemporal misalignment recognition and efficient parallel transmission. First, this system optimizes the distribution of multifunctional sensors, completes the 3D vertical heterogeneous layout of four sensors, and achieves material multi&#8208;information detection at a single place with no&#8208;spatiotemporal deviation. Additionally, the system couples and transmittes multiple sensory signals, delivering a fourfold increase in transmission efficiency and one&#8208;third of the power consumption compared to a single&#8208;channel transmission system. Finally, this system is used for the recognition of mixed materials, and human&#8208;computer interaction to realize the assignment of materials in VR, demonstrating the great accuracy and transmission efficiency of HMPTs as well as its feasibility in practical application. This is an a priori effort to enhance machine perception accuracy, improve signal transmission effectiveness, and advance human&#8208;machine&#8208;object triadic integration.

         <title>A Wet&#8208;Adhesion and Swelling&#8208;Resistant Hydrogel for Fast Hemostasis, Accelerated Tissue Injury Healing and Bioelectronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel hydrogel bioadhesive taking the structural advantage of phenylalanine derivative for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions is reported. The hydrogel adhesive can not only realize fast hemostasis and accelerated tissue/organ injuries healing in vivo but also can be assembled as bioelectronics for precise and long&#8208;term health monitoring under humid environments.








Abstract
Hydrogel bioadhesives with adequate wet adhesion and swelling resistance are urgently needed in clinic. However, the presence of blood or body fluid usually weakens the interfacial bonding strength, and even leads to adhesion failure. Herein, profiting from the unique coupling structure of carboxylic and phenyl groups in one component (N&#8208;acryloyl phenylalanine) for interfacial drainage and matrix toughening as well as various electrostatic interactions mediated by zwitterions, a novel hydrogel adhesive (PAAS) is developed with superior tissue adhesion properties and matrix swelling resistance in challenging wet conditions (adhesion strength of 85 kPa, interfacial toughness of 450 J m&#8722;2, burst pressure of 514 mmHg, and swelling ratio of &lt;4%). The PAAS hydrogel can not only realize fast hemostasis of liver, heart, artery rupture, and sealing of pulmonary air&#8208;leakage but also accelerate the recovery of stomach and liver defects in rat, rabbit, and pig models. Moreover, PAAS hydrogel can precisely and durably monitor various physiological activities (pulse, electrocardiogram, and electromyogram) even under humid environments (immersion in water for 3 days), and can be employed for the evaluation of in vivo sealing efficiency for artery rupture. The work provides a promising hydrogel adhesive for clinical hemostasis, tissue injury repair, and bioelectronics.

         <title>Topological Transformation and Dimensional Reduction in Multicomponent Metal&#8211;Organic Frameworks for Gas Separations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work presents a novel synthetic approach to multicomponent MOFs by &#8220;standing on the shoulder of&#8221; a well&#8208;established one based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process. By making use of various chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process, the structural transformation can be modulated from ternary 3D&#160;structures to quaternary 2D structures.








Abstract
Multicomponent MOFs have offered a wide range of opportunities to harness new properties. However, the synthesis of multicomponent MOFs remains challenging. This work demonstrates the synthesis of a family of multicomponent MOFs by topological transformation from well&#8208;established multicomponent partitioned acs (pacs) structures. Such transformation is based on the new understanding on the self&#8208;assembly process of pacs MOFs. A key to this understanding is that pacs structures, topologically regarded as the introduction of a pore&#8208;partitioning ligand into MOF&#8208;235/MIL&#8208;88 type framework, are likely to be formed in a layer&#8208;pillar&#8208;layer fashion in practical reactions. As the &#960;&#8211;&#960; interaction between layers and other chemical interactions during the self&#8208;assembly process are recognized, the structural transformation can be modulated from 3D pacs structures to 2D interrupted pacs structures (denoted i&#8208;pacs). It is especially noteworthy that such dimensional reduction is first observed in metal&#8208;organic frameworks and the i&#8208;pacs MOFs contain four structural modules and up to five components, which have the highest complexity among 2D MOFs. Interestingly, the i&#8208;pacs MOFs have significantly enhanced performance for CO2/N2 separation in comparison with pacs MOFs.

         <title>Boosting Anionic Redox Reactions of Li&#8208;Rich Cathodes through Lattice Oxygen and Li&#8208;Ion Kinetics Modulation in Working All&#8208;Solid&#8208;State Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The reversibility and activity of anionic redox reactions in lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) for all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) are significantly enhanced by the simultaneous incorporation of high&#8208;binding energy B&#9472;O bonds and high&#8208;efficiency LBO ionic networks into LRMO. This results in the formation of a robust LRMO&#8208;LBO interwoven structure, which stabilizes the layered structure and LRMO|solid electrolyte interface, thereby contributing to superior long&#8208;term cycling stability in ASSBs.








Abstract
The use of lithium&#8208;rich manganese&#8208;based oxides (LRMOs) as the cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) holds great potential for realizing high energy density over 600&#160;Wh kg&#8722;1. However, their implementation is significantly hindered by the sluggish kinetics and inferior reversibility of anionic redox reactions of oxygen in ASSBs. In this contribution, boron ions (B3+) doping and 3D Li2B4O7 (LBO) ionic networks construction are synchronously introduced into LRMO materials (LBO&#8208;LRMO) by mechanochemical and subsequent thermally driven diffusion method. Owing to the high binding energy of B&#9472;O and high&#8208;efficiency ionic networks of nanoscale LBO complex in cathode materials, the as&#8208;prepared LBO&#8208;LRMO displays highly reversible and activated anionic redox reactions in ASSBs. The designed LBO&#8208;LRMO interwoven structure enables robust phase and LBO&#8208;LRMO|solid electrolyte interface stability during cycling (over 80% capacity retention after 2000 cycles at 1.0 C with a voltage range of 2.2&#8211;4.7&#160;V vs Li/Li+). This contribution affords a fundamental understanding of the anionic redox reactions for LRMO in ASSBs and offers an effective strategy to realize highly activated and reversible oxygen redox reactions in LRMO&#8208;based ASSBs.

         <title>Adaptive In&#8208;Sensor Computing for Enhanced Feature Perception and Broadband Image Restoration</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel phototransistor is introduced by leveraging the unique optoelectronic properties of two low&#8208;dimensional materials. The architecture enhances image perception and restoration quality, providing a robust solution for complex scenarios in machine vision. This innovative method facilitates the precise restoration of damaged images, offering significant potential for future advancements in sensor computing.








Abstract
Traditional imaging systems struggle in weak or complex lighting environments due to their fixed spectral responses, resulting in spectral mismatches and degraded image quality. To address these challenges, a bioinspired adaptive broadband image sensor is developed. This innovative sensor leverages a meticulously designed type&#8208;I heterojunction alignment of 0D perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) and 2D black phosphorus (BP). This configuration enables efficient carrier injection control and advanced computing capabilities within an integrated phototransistor array. The sensor's unique responses to both visible and infrared (IR) light facilitate selective enhancement and precise feature extraction under varying lighting conditions. Furthermore, it supports real&#8208;time convolution and image restoration within a convolutional autoencoder (CAE) network, effectively countering image degradation by capturing spectral features. Remarkably, the hardware responsivity weights perform comparably to software&#8208;trained weights, achieving an image restoration accuracy of over 85%. This approach offers a robust and versatile solution for machine vision applications that demand precise and adaptive imaging in dynamic lighting environments.

         <title>Reversible Manipulation of Polar Topologies in Oxide Ferroelectrics via Electric Fields</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large&#8208;scale polar flux&#8208;closure array from typical c/a domains are observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers, which is reversible after the removal of external electric fields. Phase&#8208;field simulations demonstrate that the decrease of electrostatic energy is a main driving force in the transition of a/c to flux&#8208;closures.








Abstract
Polar topologies show great potentials in memories and other nano&#8208;micro devices. To integrate with silicon conducting circuits, it is vital to understand the dynamic evolution and the transformation of different domain configurations under external stimulus. Here in situ transmission electron microscopy is performed and the electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large&#8208;scale polar flux&#8208;closure array from typical c/a domains in PbTiO3/SrTiO3 bilayers is directly observed. It is found that the transformation is reversible after removal of external electric fields. Increasing external electric fields on (PbTiO3/SrTiO3)5 multilayered films, it is further found that the flux&#8208;closure domains are nucleated and propagated via the steps of first the formation of new c domains and then connection with neighboring c domains.

&lt;p&gt;The electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large-scale polar flux-closure array from typical &lt;i&gt;c/a&lt;/i&gt; domains are observed by in situ transmission electron microscopy in PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bilayers, which is reversible after the removal of external electric fields. Phase-field simulations demonstrate that the decrease of electrostatic energy is a main driving force in the transition of &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; to flux-closures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polar topologies show great potentials in memories and other nano-micro devices. To integrate with silicon conducting circuits, it is vital to understand the dynamic evolution and the transformation of different domain configurations under external stimulus. Here in situ transmission electron microscopy is performed and the electrically controlled creation and annihilation of large-scale polar flux-closure array from typical &lt;i&gt;c/a&lt;/i&gt; domains in PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; bilayers is directly observed. It is found that the transformation is reversible after removal of external electric fields. Increasing external electric fields on (PbTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/SrTiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; multilayered films, it is further found that the flux-closure domains are nucleated and propagated via the steps of first the formation of new &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; domains and then connection with neighboring &lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; domains. The transition from &lt;i&gt;a&lt;/i&gt;/&lt;i&gt;c&lt;/i&gt; domains to flux-closure arrays under electric fields is collaborated with evaluating energy variations by phase-field simulations in which the electrostatic energy plays an important role. These results demonstrate the polar topologies can be reversibly manipulated by external stimuli, which sheds light on further understanding the dynamics behavior of polar topologies and helps for future nanoelectric applications.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Beyond Fundamental Building Blocks: Plasticity in Structurally Complex Crystals</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study explores how the deformation behavior of intermetallics can be linked through their crystal's building blocks. By examining samarium&#8208;cobalt phases, it is found that their plasticity is not directly inherited from building blocks but is influenced by local bonding environments. These insights highlight the role of local bonding in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally complex intermetallics.








Abstract
Intermetallics, which encompass a wide range of compounds, often exhibit similar or closely related crystal structures, resulting in various intermetallic systems with structurally derivative phases. This study examines the hypothesis that deformation behavior can be transferred from fundamental building blocks to structurally related phases using the binary samarium&#8208;cobalt system. SmCo2 and SmCo5 are investigated as fundamental building blocks and compared them to the structurally related SmCo3 and Sm2Co17 phases. Nanoindentation and micropillar compression tests are performed to characterize the primary slip systems, complemented by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations via atomic&#8208;scale modeling. The results show that while elastic properties of the structurally complex phases follow a rule of mixtures, their plastic deformation mechanisms are more intricate, influenced by the stacking and bonding nature within the crystal's building blocks. These findings underscore the importance of local bonding environments in predicting the mechanical behavior of structurally related intermetallics, providing crucial insights for the development of high&#8208;performance intermetallic&#160;materials.

         <title>High External Quantum Efficiency and Ultra&#8208;Narrowband Organic Photodiodes Using Single&#8208;Component Photoabsorber With Multiple&#8208;Resonance Effect</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This research provides a significant breakthrough in the field of narrowband organic photodiodes (OPDs) by introducing a novel class of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN) single&#8208;component wavelength&#8208;selective materials. The OPDs incorporating these single&#8208;component BN photoabsorbers demonstrate record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 33.77% and small full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single&#8208;component photoabsorbers.








Abstract
Organic photodiodes (OPDs) that utilize wavelength&#8208;selective absorbing molecules offer a direct approach to capturing specific wavelengths of light in multispectral sensors/imaging systems without filters. However, they exhibit broad response bandwidths, low external quantum efficiency (EQE), and often require compromises in two&#8208;component photoactive materials. Herein, the first utility of boron&#8208;nitrogen (BN) single&#8208;component photoabsorbers, leveraging a multi&#8208;resonance effect are introduced to attain OPDs with both record&#8208;high EQE of 33.77% and ultra&#8208;small full&#8208;width half&#8208;maximum (FWHM) of 36 nm in the reported narrowband OPDs using single&#8208;component photoabsorbers. It is found that the outstanding performance of these narrowband OPDs can be attributed to the ultra&#8208;small FWHM, slow charge recombination, low activation energy, and balanced bipolar charge transport within the para&#8208;tert&#8208;butyl substituted B,N&#8208;embedded rigid polycyclic molecule (BNCz) film. Furthermore, BN derivatives such as BN(p)SCH3, BN(p)SO2CH3, and pyBN&#8208;m&#8208;H have also shown high EQE, minimal FWHM, and tunable photoresponse peaks ranging from blue&#8208;violet to blue&#8208;turquoise, highlighting the potential of BN molecules and molecular engineering in the development of novel narrowband absorbers for advanced wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs. Such pioneering working can provide a class of novel narrowband absorbers to propel the advancement of high&#8208;performance wavelength&#8208;selective OPDs.

         <title>Rigidity&#8208;Flexibility Regulation and Hard&#8208;Soft Donor Combination: Dual Strategies in Covalent Organic Frameworks Construction for Actinides/lanthanides Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dual strategy for the design of covalent organic frameworks integrates molecular rigidity&#8211;flexibility regulation with hard&#8211;soft atom incorporation. The synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves over 95% removal of Np(V), Pu(IV), and Am(III), with a separation factor exceeding 5000 for Np/Gd. This study marks the first application of covalent organic frameworks in separating various transuraniums from lanthanides.








Abstract
Separating actinides from lanthanides is essential for managing nuclear waste and promoting sustainable nuclear energy development. The recycling of transuranium elements (TRUs: Np, Pu, Am) is also significant for various nuclear technology applications. In this study, a dual strategy is introduced to designing covalent organic frameworks (COFs) that skillfully combines molecular rigidity with flexibility, integrating both hard and soft donor atoms in the synthesis of monomers. This results in a specialized COF that efficiently and selectively captures TRUs from acidic aqueous solutions. By utilizing the topological arrangement of rigid ligands to influence the twisting and stretching of flexible ligands, coordination environment featuring nitrogen and oxygen is created, which enhances the separation of transuranium in various oxidation states over lanthanides. In 0.5&#160;m HNO3 solution, the as&#8208;synthesized DAPhen&#8208;COF achieves removal rates of 99.1% for Np(V) and 95.8% for Pu(IV). For Am(III), the removal rate reaches 98.6% in 0.01&#160;m HNO3. DAPhen&#8208;COF exhibits remarkable selectivity for Np(V), with a separation factor of over 5000 for Np/Gd, outperforming other solid&#8208;phase materials. This research provides a comprehensive investigation into the design and synthesis of COFs for actinide capture, marking the first application of COFs in the separation of various TRUs over lanthanides.

         <title>Piezoelectric&#8208;Augmented Thermoelectric Ionogels for Self&#8208;Powered Multimodal Medical Sensors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An ionogel comprised of mobile ions and piezoelectric polymer matrices is characteristic of both piezoelectric and ionic thermoelectric attributes. The gel is capable of capturing heat, stress, and moisture from the environment and converting them into remarkably high voltage outputs, enabling acute sensing in clinic scenarios.








Abstract
A paradigm ionogel consisting of ionic liquid (IL) and PVDF&#8722;HFP composites is made, which inherently possesses dual&#8208;function ionic thermoelectric (iTE) and piezoelectric (PE) attributes. This study investigates an innovative &#8220;PE&#8208;enhanced iTEs&#8221; effect, wherein the ionic thermopower exhibits a 58% enhancement while the ionic conductivity arises more than 2&#215; within a PE&#8208;induced internal electric field. By harnessing these multifaceted features, fully self&#8208;powered, multimodal sensors demonstrate their superior energy conversion capabilities, which possessed minimum sensitivities of 0.13&#160;mV&#160;kPa&#8722;1 and 0.96&#160;mV&#160;K&#8722;1 in pressure and temperature alterations, respectively. The PE augmentation of iTEs is maximized by &#8776;3&#215; under rising water pressure. Their swift and sophisticated responses to various in vivo vital signs simultaneously in a hemorrhagic shock scenario, indicative of good prospects in the clinical medicine field are showcased.

This study investigates an innovative &#8220;PE-enhanced iTEs&#8221; effect, wherein the ionic thermopower exhibits a 58% enhancement while the ionic conductivity arises more than 2&#215; within a PE-induced internal electric field. By harnessing these multifaceted features, fully self-powered, multimodal sensors demonstrate their superior energy conversion capabilities, which possessed minimum sensitivities of 0.13&#160;mV&#160;kPa&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.96&#160;mV&#160;K&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; in pressure and temperature alterations, respectively. The PE augmentation of iTEs is maximized by &#8776;3&#215; under rising water pressure. Their swift and sophisticated responses to various in vivo vital signs simultaneously in a hemorrhagic shock scenario, indicative of good prospects in the clinical medicine field are showcased.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Fully Transparent and Distortion&#8208;Free Monotonically Stretchable Substrate by Nanostructure Alignment</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
For achieving monotonic transparent, stretchable substrates with near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio, this approach utilizes nanoscopic block copolymer alignment via shear&#8208;rolling. This alignment of nanostructures smaller than the wavelength of light yields a near&#8208;zero Poisson's ratio (&#8776;0.07), eliminating vertical contraction and maintaining distortion&#8208;free performance under uniform strain across the entire area even under 50% strain, with excellent optical properties.








Abstract
Stretchable devices, garnering increasing attention as next&#8208;generation form factors, have a crucial problem in that vertical contraction occurs during stretching, causing image distortion of stretchable displays and discomfort in skin&#8208;attached devices. Previous structural strategies to mitigate vertical contraction, such as auxetic reentrants and wrinkles, suffer from the drawback that their structure becomes visible during stretching. In this study, this issue is addressed by unidirectionally aligning nanoscopic cylinders within block copolymer elastomer films. Employing a shear&#8208;rolling process at high temperatures on thick films of polystyrene&#8208;block&#8208;polyisobutylene&#8208;block&#8208;polystyrene thermoplastic elastomers, macroscopic mechanical anisotropy is achieved, resulting in completely transparent and monotonically stretchable substrates devoid of vertical or depth distortion during deformation. Significantly, the unidirectional orientation of high&#8208;modulus cylindrical nanostructures induces macroscopic mechanical anisotropy with a modulus ratio exceeding five times. While the Poisson's ratio of conventional elastic materials hovers around &#8776;0.5, this mechanical anisotropy minimizes vertical contraction, yielding a Poisson's ratio below 0.07. Moreover, owing to the negligible size of the nanocylinders compared to visible&#8208;light wavelengths, the substrate can be monotonically uniaxially stretched while maintaining high transmittance without introducing distortions, surface undulations, or haziness, resulting in distortion&#8208;free stretchable substrates.

         <title>Unveiling Charge Carrier Dynamics at Organic&#8211;Inorganic S&#8208;Scheme Heterojunction Interfaces: Insights From Advanced EPR</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops TP/ZIS&#8208;10 S&#8208;scheme heterostructures, uncovers unique charge transfer dynamics via TR EPR, ISIXPS, and fs&#8208;TA spectroscopy, and provides novel insights into charge carrier dynamics at S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interfaces, paving the way for efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic S&#8208;scheme photocatalysts for green energy conversion.








Abstract
Understanding charge carrier transfer at heterojunction interfaces is critical for advancing solar energy conversion technologies. This study utilizes continuous wave (CW), pulse, and time&#8208;resolved (TR) electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy to explore the radical species formed at the TAPA (tris(4&#8722;aminophenyl)amine)&#8208;PDA (Terephthaldicarboxaldehyde)/ZnIn2S4 (TP/ZIS) heterojunction interface. CW and pulse EPR identify stable radical defects localized near the interface, accessible to water molecules. Time&#8208;resolved EPR reveals a photoinduced electron transfer from TP to ZIS, leading to the generation of spin&#8208;correlated radical pairs under light irradiation, signifying efficient charge carrier separation and spatial transfer within the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction. This electron transfer mechanism, confirmed through in situ X&#8211;ray photoelectron spectroscopy and femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy, suppresses undesirable carrier recombination, extending charge carrier lifetimes. These findings provide novel insights into the transport direction of charge carriers at the S&#8208;scheme heterojunction interface, offering valuable guidance for designing highly efficient and stable organic&#8211;inorganic heterojunction photocatalysts for solar energy applications.

         <title>Regulating Charge Separation Via Periodic Array Nanostructures for Plasmon&#8208;Enhanced Water Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study presents a plasmonic photocatalyst with an ordered Au nanoparticle array on SrTiO3, enhancing surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining constant resonant energy due to surface lattice resonance. This balance improves charge separation and increases local charge density at active sites, boosting water oxidation activity sevenfold. These results demonstrate a promising strategy for optimizing SPR characteristics to enhance photocatalytic performance on plasmonic platforms, opening avenues for more efficient energy conversion applications.








Abstract
Plasmonic resonance intensity in metallic nanostructures plays a crucial role in charge generation and separation, directly affecting plasmon&#8208;induced photocatalytic activity. Engineering strategies to enhance plasmonic effects involve designing specific nanostructures, such as triangular nanoplates with sharp corners or dimer nanostructures with hot spots. However, these approaches often lead to a trade&#8208;off between enhanced plasmonic intensity and resonance energy, which ultimately determines local charge density and photocatalytic performance. Here, inspired by theoretical predications, it is shown that a flexibly controlled plasmonic photocatalyst, consisting of an ordered array of Au nanoparticles on a SrTiO3 surface, exhibits an enhanced surface plasmon resonance (SPR) intensity while maintaining a constant SPR resonant energy, due to the presence of surface lattice resonance. This trade&#8208;off results in improved charge separation efficiency and an increase in local charge density at catalytically active sites, as verified by theoretical simulations, surface photovoltage microscopy, and ultrafast transient absorption spectroscopy. Moreover, the optimized periodic photocatalyst shows a 7&#8208;fold increase in water oxidation activity over disordered nanostructures. This work provides a novel approach for balancing the intensity and energy of SPR, which will contribute to optimizing photocatalytic activity on plasmonic platforms.

         <title>Dynamic Liquid Metal&#8211;Microfiber Interlocking Enables Highly Conductive and Strain&#8208;insensitive Metastructured Fibers for Wearable Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A dynamic liquid metal&#8211;microfiber interlocking interface is proposed to develop a highly stable and conductive metastructured fiber, which shows remarkable conductivity of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, and maintains stable conductance with only a 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain. These fibers are demonstrated as versatile platforms for wearable temperature&#8208;visualizing electrothermal heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing&#8208;display fabrics.








Abstract
Stretchable fibers with high conductivity are vital components for smart textiles and wearable electronics. However, embedding solid conductive materials in polymers significantly reduces conductive pathways when stretched, causing a sharp drop in conductivity. Here, a stretchable metastructured fiber with dynamic liquid metal&#8211;microfiber interlocking interface is reported to realize highly conductive yet ultrastable conductance. The Cu&#8208;EGaIn mixture is partially embedded within the porous microfiber mat, thereby enabling its roll&#8208;up into a spiral&#8208;layered metastructured fiber with self&#8208;compensating conductive pathways. The metastructured fiber shows outstanding performance, including high conductivity of 1.5&#160;&#215;&#160;106&#160;S&#160;m&#8722;1, large stretchability up to 629%, and ultrastable conductance with only 16% relative resistance change at 100% strain, which far surpasses the theoretical value. Moreover, these fibers have served as versatile platforms for wearable temperature&#8208;visualizing electrothermal fiber heaters and fully stretchable smart sensing&#8208;display fabrics. This dynamic solid&#8211;liquid interfacial interlocking strategy is promising for stretchable electronics.

         <title>In Situ Metal Vacancy Filling in Stable Pd&#8208;Sn Intermetallic Catalyst for Enhanced C&#63743;C Bond Cleavage in Ethanol Oxidation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A Pd&#8208;Sn intermetallic compound with Pd deficiency (Pd1.9&#8722;xSn, x = 0.06), enhanced by Sn incorporation from SnOx, demonstrates superior electrocatalytic activity for ethanol oxidation. The efficient dissociation of the C&#8211;C bond highlights its potential for energy conversion applications.








Abstract
A common challenge in electrochemical processes is developing high performance, stable catalysts for specific chemical reactions. In this work, a Pd&#8208;Sn intermetallic compound with &#160; Pd site deficiency (Pd1.9&#8722;xSn) (x = 0.06) and trace amount of SnOx was synthesised by controlled process. Under the electrochemical conditions, the deficient Pd site is filled by metallic Sn, which generates a highly active and stable (Pd1.84Sn0.06)Sn catalyst for ethanol oxidation reaction (EOR). The crystal structure and atomic arrangements for synthesized and in situ generated compound are comprehensively characterized by various spectroscopic techniques. The in situ generated catalyst exhibits excellent performance toward EOR (anodic reaction in fuel cell), which outperforms the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art Pd/C catalyst by three times in terms of activity. Furthermore, it is observed that the catalyst preferentially cleaves the C&#63743;C bond in ethanol, which is a crucial process that enhances the efficiency of the fuel cells. The catalyst retains its superlative activity even after 1500 cycles of continuous operation. The mechanism for EOR and C&#63743;C bond cleavage is evidenced by operando Infra Red spectroscopy&#160;and Differential Electrochemical Mass Spectroscopy (DEMS), and the driving force toward excellent performance has been proposed via theoretical&#160;calculations.

         <title>Acid&#8208;Induced in Situ Phase Separation and Percolation for Constructing Bi&#8208;Continuous Phase Hydrogel Electrodes With Motion&#8208;Insensitive Property</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work develops a one&#8208;step strategy to fabricate bi&#8208;continuous phase hydrogels under mild conditions. The resulting hydrogel exhibits excellent conductivity, elasticity, strain insensitivity, and biocompatibility. The hydrogel&#8208;based electrode facilitates motion&#8208;artifact&#8208;free electrophysiological signal monitoring and enables wireless, multimodal data acquisition under dynamic conditions. This cutting&#8208;edge technology offers potent tools for healthcare and medical management.








Abstract
Conducting&#160;polymer hydrogels have gained attention in the bioelectronics field due to their unique combination of biocompatibility and customizable mechanical properties. However, achieving both excellent conductivity and mechanical strength in a hydrogel remains a significant challenge, primarily because of the inherent conflict between the hydrophobic nature of conducting polymers and the hydrophilic characteristics of hydrogels. To address this issue, this work proposes a simple one&#8208;step acid&#8208;induced approach that not only promotes the gelation of hydrophilic polymers but also facilitates the in situ phase separation of hydrophobic conducting polymers under mild conditions. This results in a distinctive bi&#8208;continuous phase structure with exceptional electrical property (906 mS cm&#8722;1) and mechanical performance (fracture strain of 1103%). The hydrogel forms robust percolating networks that maintain structural integrity under mechanical stress due to their entropic elasticity, providing remarkable strain insensitivity, low mechanical hysteresis, and an impressive resilience (95%). Electrodes fabricated from the conductive hydrogel exhibit stable and minimal interfacial contact impedance with skin (1&#8211;6 kilohms at 1&#8211;100&#160;Hz) and significantly lower noise power (4.9 &#181;V2). This work believes that the motion&#8208;insensitive characteristics and mechanical robustness of this hydrogel will enable efficient and reliable monitoring of biological signals, establishing a new benchmark in the bioelectronics.

         <title>Constructing High&#8208;Performance Composite Epoxy Resins: Interfacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; Stacking Interactions&#8208;Driven Physical Rolling Behavior of Silica Microspheres</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient energy transfer of rolling spheres based on the basic law of physics forms the basis of a novel strategy, wherein the 3 interface &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions induce the &#8220;rolling behavior&#8221; of microspheres. This approach mitigates local stress concentrations in composite epoxy resins, resulting in a synergistic enhancement of strength and toughness.








Abstract
The intrinsic compromise between strength and toughness in composite epoxy resins significantly constrains their practical applications. In this study, a novel strategy is introduced, leveraging interfacial &#960;&#8208;&#960; stacking interactions to induce the &#8220;rolling behavior&#8221; of microsphere fillers, thereby facilitating efficient energy dissipation. This approach is corroborated through theoretical simulations and experimental validation. The resulting composite epoxy resin demonstrates an impressive 49.8% enhancement in strength and a remarkable 358.9% improvement in toughness compared to conventional epoxy resins, accompanied by substantially reduced hysteresis. Moreover, this system achieves reversible closed&#8208;loop recyclability and rapid repair capabilities. The preliminary demonstration of &#8220;force&#8208;temperature equivalence&#8221; further establishes a novel pathway for the design of high&#8208;performance composite epoxy materials.

         <title>Chemomechanical Self&#8208;Oscillatory Microgel Motility in Stratified Chemical Media</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A simple design is illustrated for achieving prolonged and damped chemomechanical oscillations using a stimuli&#8208;responsive membrane&#8208;bound microgel within a stratified environment containing partitioned swelling and deswelling stimuli. The swelling and deswelling responses of the microgel in the bottom and top layers are coupled to buoyant motility via membrane&#8208;mediated displacement of the external media.








Abstract
The design of chemomechanical self&#8208;oscillators, which execute oscillations in the presence of constant stimuli lacking periodicity, is a step toward the development of autonomous and interactive soft robotic systems. This work presents a simple design of prolonged chemomechanical oscillatory movement in a microgel system capable of buoyant motility within stratified chemical media containing spatially localized sinking and floating stimuli. Three design elements are developed: a stimuli&#8208;responsive membranized calcium alginate microgel, a Percoll density gradient for providing stratified antagonistic chemical media, and transduction of microgel particle size actuation into buoyant motility via membrane&#8208;mediated displacement of the Percoll media. The presence of citrate or calcium ions in different layers of the Percoll media gives rise to swelling (buoyancy) or contraction (geotaxis), respectively, which in turn mediate the shuttling of the microgels between the layers to produce prolonged or damped chemomechanical oscillatory trajectories. The concentration&#8208;dependence of the oscillatory behavior in the stratified media, the density gap between the Percoll layers, and the kinetic asymmetry of microgel swelling and deswelling are studied. The illustrated modular design allows for the development of chemomechanical self&#8208;oscillators responsive to light, pH, or temperature, which will find applications in interactive soft robotics, autonomous microbots, and intelligent materials.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;High Capacitive Energy Storage Density at 150&#160;&#176;C Achieved in Polyetherimide Composite Films by Filler and Structure Design</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high &#603;r, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT&#8208;BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid&#8208;phase reaction method, and BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot&#8208;pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.








Abstract
Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (Eb), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic&#8208;electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra&#8208;high dielectric constant (&#603;r) and charge/discharge efficiency (&#951;) of 0.55Bi0.5(Na0.84K0.16)0.5TiO3&#8208;0.45(Bi0.1Sr0.85)TiO3 (BNKT&#8208;BST) ceramics are prepared by the solid&#8208;phase reaction method and added to polyetherimide (PEI) to form BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposites with various structures. The findings indicate that the sandwich&#8208;structured BNKT&#8208;BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (Ud) of 7.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 with &#951; of 80.2% when the Eb is 650 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 at 150&#160;&#176;C. This is primarily due to the incorporation of BNKT&#8208;BST nanoparticles and the multilayer structure design, which significantly improves the composite's &#603;r and Eb. Additionally, the sandwich&#8208;structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV&#160;m&#8722;1 and 150&#160;&#176;C, with Ud of &#8776; 4.7 J&#160;cm&#8722;3 and &#951; greater than 90%.

&lt;p&gt;The stacked structure design method of integrating inorganic fillers with high &lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;, and PEI polymers with high breakdown strength is proposed. BNKT-BST dense ceramics are prepared by solid-phase reaction method, and BNKT-BST/PEI nanocomposites are prepared by casting and hot-pressing method, which resulted in nanocomposites with excellent energy storage properties at high temperatures.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Polymer dielectrics are crucial for electronic communications and industrial applications due to their high breakdown field strength (&lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;), fast charge/discharge speed, and temperature stability. The upcoming electronic-electrical systems pose a significant challenge, necessitating polymeric dielectrics to exhibit exceptional thermal stability and energy storage capabilities at high temperatures. Here, ultra-high dielectric constant (&lt;i&gt;&#603;&lt;/i&gt;

The findings indicate that the sandwich-structured BNKT-BST/PEI nanocomposite achieves the highest discharged energy density (&lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; and &lt;i&gt;E&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;. Additionally, the sandwich-structured composites show excellent cycling stability at 500 MV&#160;m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt; and 150&#160;&#176;C, with &lt;i&gt;U&lt;/i&gt;

         <title>Dynamic Modulation of Afterglow Emission in Polymeric Phosphors via Inverse Opal Photonic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A robust method is presented for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by incorporating a supporting layer of inverse opal photonic structures. These findings provide valuable insights into the physical modulation of afterglow in polymeric phosphors and position the resulting Janus film for potential applications in biosensing and information storage.








Abstract
Tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors is critical for advancing their use in optical data storage and display technologies. Despite advancements in polymer matrix design and dopant engineering, achieving dynamic control over afterglow intensity remains a significant challenge. In this study, a novel approach is introduced for dynamically tuning the afterglow of polymeric phosphors by integrating them into an inverse opal photonic structure. By precisely aligning the photonic stopband of the inverse opal structure with the afterglow band of the polymer film, a remarkable 15&#8208;fold enhancement in afterglow intensity is achieved. This enhancement is tunable, decreasing from 15 to 1.2 by infiltrating the photonic structure with media of varying refractive indices ranging from 1.00 (air) to 1.37 (ethyl acetate). The tunability arises from reducing the mismatch between the stopband and the afterglow band, as the weighted refractive index shifts between 1.15 and 1.40. Additionally, the inverse opal photonic structure induces angle&#8208;dependent structural colors in the Janus polymeric phosphors, modulated by the refractive index of the infiltrating media. This integration of dynamically tunable afterglow with angle&#8208;dependent structural coloration unlocks new potential for advanced optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Efficiency Boost in Through Space Charge Transfer Emitters: Insights from Spiro Lateral Rocking Confinement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Sterical aryl immobilizing groups are incorporated (phenyl and pyridine) at the C8 site of the rigid fluorene spacer. These immobilizing groups restrict both rotational and rocking motions. The completely confined conformation demonstrates enhanced TADF performance.








Abstract
Intramolecular through&#8208;space charge&#8208;transfer (TSCT) excited states have emerged as promising candidates for thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters. This study addresses the challenges in tuning excited state dynamics through conformational engineering, which significantly impacts exciton utilization. An effective strategy is presented to enhance the performance of TSCT&#8208;TADF molecules by restricting the lateral rocking of the spiro unit via immobilizing groups, which indirectly adjusts the conformations of the donor and acceptor subunits. This approach is successfully illustrated with two TSCT&#8208;TADF emitters, 8PhDM&#8208;B and 8PyDM&#8208;B, featuring sterical aryl phenyl and pyridine substitutions at the C8 site of a rigid spiro&#8208;fluorene bridge. Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) utilizing these emitters demonstrated impressive maximum external quantum efficiencies of 33.1% and 31.0%, respectively. The findings underscore the importance of the rocking confined strategy in refining excited state dynamics, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of highly efficient OLED emitters.

         <title>High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Analysis of Local Nascent Protein Deposition in 3D Microenvironments via Extracellular Protein Identification Cytometry (EPIC)</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Knowledge of the extracellular matrix drives the understanding of cell behavior. However, current analysis methods are limited to either bulk or low&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis, thus masking the heterogeneity in matrix deposition. Extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) combines the high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of flow cytometry with engineered microniche 3D cell culture, jointly enabling in situ matrix analysis of large cell populations.








Abstract
Extracellular matrix (ECM) guides cell behavior and tissue fate. Cell populations are notoriously heterogeneous leading to large variations in cell behavior at the single&#8208;cell level. Although insights into population heterogeneity are valuable for fundamental biology, regenerative medicine, and drug testing, current ECM analysis techniques only provide either averaged population&#8208;level data or single&#8208;cell data from a limited number of cells. Here, extracellular protein identification cytometry (EPIC) is presented as a novel platform technology that enables high&#8208;throughput measurements of local nascent protein deposition at single&#8208;cell level. Specifically, human primary chondrocytes are microfluidically encapsulated in enzymatically crosslinked microgels of 16 picoliter at kHz rates, forming large libraries of discrete 3D single&#8208;cell microniches in which ECM can be deposited. ECM proteins are labeled using fluorescence immunostaining to allow for nondestructive analysis via flow cytometry. This approach reveals population heterogeneity in matrix deposition at unprecedented throughput, allowing for the identification and fluorescent activated cell sorting&#8208;mediated isolation of cellular subpopulations. Additionally, it is demonstrated that inclusion of a second cell into microgels allows for studying the effect of cell&#8208;cell contact on matrix deposition. In summary, EPIC enables high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell analysis of nascent proteins in 3D microenvironments, which is anticipated to advance fundamental knowledge and tissue engineering applications.

Abstract
The growing significance of information technology requires advanced information storage and security solutions. While extending traditional 2D&#160;codes with additional parameters has led to promising 3D codes, increasing information capacity and security remains challenging. Herein, a 3D quick response (QR) cube platform that utilizes near&#8208;infrared (NIR)&#8208;to&#8208;NIR upconversion nanoparticles as light&#8208;emitting probes, benefiting from their photostability and low scattering properties. These features enable precise reconstruction of the 3D QR cube. The platform employs volumetric space for information encoding by leveraging spatial information in a 3D environment, demonstrating potential to significantly increase information capacity and facilitate access from all three spatial dimensions (x, y, z), while enhancing security. This study develops a platform for analyzing and reconstructing 3D QR cubes using NIR imaging and employs a convolutional neural network model to determine the 3D structure from image intensity variations, achieving 99.9% accuracy in predicting cube configurations. By leveraging 3D spatial information and logical circuits, the encryption method has the potential to significantly surpass the encryption strength of traditional 2D codes. The findings demonstrate high prediction accuracy and introduce new possibilities for multi&#8208;level encryption with spatial security keys in 3D space, offering a robust solution for advanced information storage and security.

         <title>Simultaneous Regulating the Surface, Interface, and Bulk via Phosphating Modification for High&#8208;Performance Li&#8208;Rich Layered Oxides Cathodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A straightforward and effective &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy is exploited to achieve cooperative enhancements across the surface, interface, and bulk phase. This strategy provides a comprehensive understanding of reversible and irreversible characteristics of oxygen redox processes, offering theoretical guidance and experimental evidence for enhancing anionic redox reversibility and designing high&#8208;performance Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based layered oxides (LRMOs) are regarded as the leading cathode materials to overcome the bottleneck of higher energy density. Nevertheless, they encounter significant challenges, including voltage decay, poor cycle stability, and inferior rate performance, primarily due to irreversible oxygen release, transition metal dissolution, and sluggish transport kinetics. Moreover, traditionally single modification strategies do not adequately address these issues. Herein, an innovative &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy is developed, simultaneously regulating the surface, interface, and bulk via an in&#8208;situ gas&#8211;solid interface phosphating reaction to create P&#8208;doped Li1.2Mn0.54Ni0.13Co0.13O2@Spinel@Li3PO4. Specifically, Li3PO4 surface coating layer shields particles from electrolyte corrosion and enhances Li+ diffusion; in&#8208;situ constructed spinel interfacial layer reduces phase distortion and suppresses the lattice strain; the strong P&#9472;O bond derived from P&#8208;doping stabilizes the lattice oxygen frame and inhibits the release of O2, thereby improving the reversibility of oxygen redox reaction. As a result, the phosphatized LRMO demonstrates an exceptional capacity retention of 82.1% at 1C after 300 cycles (compared to 50.8% for LRMO), an outstanding rate capability of 170.5 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5C (vs 98.9 mAh g&#8722;1 for LRMO), along with excellent voltage maintenance and thermostability. Clearly, this &#8220;all&#8208;in&#8208;one&#8221; modification strategy offers a novel approach for high&#8208;energy&#8208;density lithium&#8208;ion batteries.

         <title>Orbital Coupling of Dual&#8208;Atom Sites Boosts Electrocatalytic NO Oxidation and Dynamic Intracellular Response</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new strategy is proposed for the precise fabrication of orbital&#8208;coupled dual&#8208;atomic sites, which aims to enhance the affinity between the Ni sites and NO within Co1Ni1&#8208;NC. This strategy is specifically designed to significantly boost the performance of the NO oxidation reaction, contributing to advancements in the field of single&#8208;cell in situ monitoring of NO.









Abstract
In situ measurement of nitric oxide (NO) in living tissue and single cells is highly important for achieving a profound comprehension of cellular functionalities and facilitating the precise diagnosis of critical diseases; however, the progress is greatly hindered by the weak affinity of ultratrace concentration NO in cellular environment toward electrocatalysts. Herein, a new strategy is reported for precisely constructing orbital coupled dual&#8208;atomic sites to enhance the affinity between the metal atomic sites and NO on a class of N&#8208;doped hollow carbon matrix dual&#8208;atomic sites Co&#9472;Ni (Co1Ni1&#8208;NC) for greatly boosting electrocatalytic NO performance. The as&#8208;synthesized Co1Ni1&#8208;NC demonstrates a substantially higher current density than Ni1&#8208;NC and Co1&#8208;NC, coupled with exceptional stability with a negligible degradation rate of 0.6 &#181;A&#183;cm&#8722;2&#183;h&#8722;1, which is the best among the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art electrocatalysts for NO oxidation. Experimental and theoretical investigations collectively reveal that the pivotal role of d&#8208;d orbit coupling between Co and Ni sites enables Ni to acquire additional electrons, leading to the occupation of Ni's 3dxy/yz within the 2&#960; orbitals of NO, thus weakening the N&#8801;O triple bond and concurrently accelerating NO adsorption kinetics. It is demonstrated that Co1Ni1&#8208;NC&#8208;coated nanoelectrode can achieve the in situ sensing of NO in living organs and single cells.

         <title>Reinforcing Gelatin Hydrogels via In Situ Phase Separation and Enhanced Interphase Bonding for Advanced 3D Fabrication</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study develops a novel gelatin hydrogel through microstructural optimization. The resulting hydrogel exhibits superior mechanical properties compared to conventional methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) gels while preserving key benefits like rapid gelation, cell adhesion, and complete biodegradability. These combined properties significantly enhance the precision and complexity of gelatin hydrogels for 3D printing and their applications in biomedicine.








Abstract
Gelatin hydrogels (e.g., methacrylated gelatin gel, abbreviated GelMA gel) have garnered significant attention in tissue engineering and therapeutic drug and cell delivery due to their complete degradability and intrinsic ability to support cell adhesion. However, their practical applications are often constrained by their poor mechanical performance, which stems from their single network structure. This limitation poses significant challenges in load&#8208;bearing scenarios and restricts their use in advanced biofabrication technologies, where robust mechanical properties are essential. Here a hydrogel is developed composed entirely of gelatin using a phototriggered transient&#8208;radical and persistent&#8208;radical coupling (PTPC) reaction to achieve an optimized microstructure. This hydrogel features a phase&#8208;separated structure with enhanced interfacial bonding, significantly improving mechanical performance compared to conventional GelMA gels. Notably, this approach preserves the inherent properties of gelatin, including biocompatibility, cell adhesion, and degradability, thereby extending its applicability in the biomedical field, particularly in advanced biofabrication methods such as 3D printing. This approach offers a superior solution to meet the complex demands of sophisticated biomanufacturing technologies, expanding the potential applications of gelatin hydrogels in the biomedical field.

         <title>Giant Ultrabroadband Bulk Photovoltaic Effect Engendered by Two&#8208;Photon Absorption in &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 for Chiral Terahertz Wave Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work reports giant ultrabroadband two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz emission spectroscopy. Ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 outperforms standard terahertz emitters like p&#8208;InAs, enabling efficient chiral terahertz wave emission with tunable orientation and ellipticity. The work highlights TPA&#8208;induced BPVE in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectrics supports high&#8208;performance BPVE devices and guides chiral THz wave design.








Abstract
Bulk photovoltaic effect (BPVE) can break the Shockley&#8211;Queisser limit by leveraging the inherent asymmetry of crystal lattice without a junction. However, this effect is mainly confined to UV&#8211;vis spectrum due to the wide&#8208;bandgap nature of traditional ferroelectric materials, thereby limiting the exploration of the infrared light&#8208;driven efficient BPVE. Herein, giant two&#8208;photon absorption (TPA) driven BPVE is uncovered from visible to infrared in ferroelectric &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 utilizing wavelength&#8208;tunable terahertz (THz) emission spectroscopy. Remarkably, &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like p&#8208;InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent&#8208;type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA&#8208;driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth&#8208;order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA&#8208;engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single&#8208;photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in&#8208;plane and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA&#8208;induced BPVE responses in narrow&#8208;bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high&#8208;performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.

Remarkably, &lt;i&gt;&#945;&lt;/i&gt;-In&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; exhibits exceptional THz emission efficiency in the infrared region, surpassing renowned THz emitters like &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;-InAs and achieving an efficiency approximately eight times the magnitude of standard ZnTe. The power exponent-type pump fluence and quadruple polarization features reveal a unique TPA-driven BPVE, corroborated by a fourth-order nonlinear oscillator model. Notably, TPA-engendered BPVE efficiency approaches 68% of that observed in the single-photon absorption process. Moreover, the TPA responses display clear polarization anisotropy, with considerably relative phase and amplitude driven by synchronous in-plane and out-of-plane polarization, leading to chiral THz waves with high efficiency, tunable orientation, and controllable ellipticity. This work highlights the advantages of TPA-induced BPVE responses in narrow-bandgap ferroelectric semiconductors, enhancing spectral utilization efficiency, aiding high-performance devices based on BPVE, and guiding chiral THz wave design.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies. When neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, it significantly reduces the brain infarct area, promotes synaptic reorganization, and restores motor functions and balance.









Abstract
Implantable neural probes hold promise for acquiring brain data, modulating neural circuits, and treating various brain disorders. However, traditional implantable probes face significant challenges in practical applications, such as balancing sensitivity with biocompatibility and the difficulties of in situ neural information monitoring and neuromodulation. To address these challenges, this study developed an implantable hydrogel probe capable of recording neural signals, modulating neural circuits, and treating stroke. Amylopectin is integrated into the hydrogels, which can induce reorientation of the poly(3,4&#8208;ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) chain and create compliant interfaces with brain tissues, enhancing both sensitivity and biocompatibility. The hydrogel probe shows the capability of continuously recording deep brain signals for 8 weeks. The hydrogel probe is effectively utilized to study deep brain signals associated with various physiological activities. Neuromodulation and neural signal monitoring are performed directly in the primary motor cortex of rats, enabling control over their limb behaviors through evoked signals. When applied to the primary motor cortex of stroke&#8208;affected rats, neuromodulation significantly reduced the brain infarct area, promoted synaptic reorganization, and restored motor functions and balance. This research represents a significant scientific breakthrough in the design of neural probes for brain monitoring, neural circuit modulation, and the development of brain disease therapies.

         <title>Programmable Morphology&#8208;Adaptive Peptide Nanoassembly for Enhanced Catalytic Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A programmable, morphologically adaptive nanomaterial, FeFKC, is developed as an efficient delivery system for nanocatalytic tumor therapy. Through pH&#8208;triggered shape&#8208;shifting, FeFKC enhances endocytosis, lysosomal escape, and mitochondrial localization, significantly boosting its catalytic impact. It suppressed tumors by up to 95% without evident safety concerns in mouse models, indicating broad potential for future targeted therapies.








Abstract
Nanocatalytic therapy holds significant promise in cancer treatment by exploiting the high oxidative stress within tumor cells. However, efficiently delivering nanocatalytic agents to tumor tissues and maximizing their catalytic activity in situ remain critical challenges. Morphology&#8208;adaptive delivery systems, capable of adjusting their physical form in response to physiological conditions, offer unique spatiotemporal control for navigating complex biological environments like the tumor microenvironment. While designing systems that undergo multiple shape transformations often involves complex stimuli&#8208;responsive mechanisms, making programmable responses through simple designs highly desirable yet challenging. Here, FeFKC, an innovative adaptive material is introduced that achieves multi&#8208;step morphological transformations at the tissue level and amplifies catalytic activity through a straightforward design. As the microenvironmental pH decreases during drug delivery, FeFKC dynamically transitions between single chains, nanoparticles, and nanofibers. This programmable shape&#8208;shifting facilitates deep tumor penetration, enhanced cellular uptake, and lysosomal escape, significantly improving its catalytic efficiency in nanocatalytic tumor therapy. In vivo studies demonstrate that FeFKC achieves impressive tumor suppression efficacy of up to 95% without notable biosafety concerns. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive nanomaterials with programmable shape&#8208;transforming capabilities to overcome biological barriers and enhance catalytic therapy, opening new avenues for cancer treatment and other complex diseases.

         <title>Switchable Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry Phases in Heterogeneously Integrated THz Metasurfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle.








Abstract
The Pancharatnam&#8211;Berry (PB) phase has revolutionized the design of metasurfaces, offering a straightforward and robust method for controlling wavefronts of electromagnetic waves. However, traditional metasurfaces have fixed PB phases determined by the orientation of their individual elements. In this study, an innovative structural design and integration scheme is proposed that utilizes vanadium dioxide, a phase&#8208;change material, to achieve thermally controlled dynamic PB phase control within the metasurface. By leveraging the material's properties, this can dynamically alter the optical orientation of individual elements of the metasurface and achieve temperature&#8208;dependent local phase modulation based on the geometric phase principle. This approach, combined with advanced fabrication processing technology, paves the way for next&#8208;generation dynamic devices with customizable functions.

         <title>Tough Polyurethane Hydrogels with a Multiple Hydrogen&#8208;Bond Interlocked Bicontinuous Phase Structure Prepared by In Situ Water&#8208;Induced Microphase Separation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Tough polyurethane hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure are prepared by in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation. The outstanding mechanical performances endow the hydrogels with the capability to resist abdominal pressure and prevent hernia formation in vivo.








Abstract
Hydrogels with mechanical performances similar to load&#8208;bearing tissues are in demand for in vivo applications. In this work, inspired by the self&#8208;assembly behavior of amphiphilic polymers, polyurethane&#8208;based tough hydrogels with a multiple hydrogen&#8208;bond interlocked bicontinuous phase structure through in situ water&#8208;induced microphase separation strategy are developed, in which poly(ethylene glycol)&#8208;based polyurethane (PEG&#8208;PU, hydrophilic) and poly(&#949;&#8208;caprolactone)&#8208;based polyurethane (PCL&#8208;PU, hydrophobic) are blended to form dry films followed by water swelling. A multiple hydrogen bonding factor, imidazolidinyl urea, is introduced into the synthesis of the two polyurethanes, and the formation of multiple hydrogen bonds between PEG&#8208;PU and PCL&#8208;PU can promote homogeneous microphase separation for the construction of bicontinuous phase structures in the hydrogel network, by which the hydrogel features break strength of 12.9 MPa, fracture energy of 2435 J m&#8722;2, and toughness of 48.2 MJ m&#8722;3. As a biomedical patch, the outstanding mechanical performances can withstand abdominal pressure to prevent hernia formation in the abdominal wall defect model. Compared to the commercial PP mesh, hydrogel can prevent tissue/organ adhesion to reduce inflammatory responses and promote angiogenesis, thereby accelerating the repair of abdominal wall defects. This work may provide useful inspiration for researchers to design different gel materials through solvent&#8208;induced microphase separation.

The camouflage&#8208;monitoring&#8208;protection triune integrated modular unit achieves remarkable optical&#8208;microwave compatibility, which is instructed by machine learning and further assembled into a programmable array, exhibiting extraordinary programmability, multi&#8208;scenario adaptability, fast responsiveness, and long&#8208;life durability.

Abstract
Optical&#8208;electromagnetic compatible devices are urgently required in intelligent building monitors and cross&#8208;band protection. Meanwhile, the insufficient systematicness and semi&#8208;empirical attempts significantly limit the prosperity of cross&#8208;band materials, causing enormous challenges for deviceization and material database construction. Herein, the systematical component&#8208;deviceization&#8208;machine learning prediction&#8208;array construction strategy is attempted to solve the bottleneck issues. A luminance&#8208;triggered camouflage&#8208;monitoring&#8208;protection triune integrated modular unit (IMU) is hierarchically encapsulated to simultaneously achieve efficient anti&#8208;electromagnetic interference (EMI), light&#8208;absorbing, quick gradient&#8208;colorization response. Moreover, an illumination intensity dataset and a surrogate model based on fully connected neural network fitting (FCNN&#8208;fitting) are constructed, which accurately predicts the light&#8208;absorbing property of IMUs and can be instructional for material selection. The IMUs are specifically assembled into a 4*4 array, aiming at multi&#8208;scenario application of programmable display, camouflage pattern, surface conformality, and rapid replaceability. This work paves the path and provides a promising strategy for optical&#8208;electromagnetic compatibility and material genetics&#8208;deviceization&#8208;array systematization.

         <title>Engineered Bacteria Manipulate Cysteine Metabolism to Boost Ferroptosis&#8208;Based Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma Therapy</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A metabolism&#8208;engineered bacterium inspired by sulfur&#8208;metabolizing bacteria is developed, functioning as a live drug that efficiently and precisely depletes the substrate cysteine, thereby completely blocking cysteine metabolism. This disruption dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves effective treatment. This introduces a novel approach to treating PDAC by exploiting metabolic vulnerabilities with living engineered bacteria.









Abstract
Cysteine metabolism is a key determinant of the defense against ferroptosis in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). Blocking cysteine metabolism may trigger potent ferroptosis in PDAC cells by generating lipid peroxides during tumor metabolic processes. However, current methods to limit cysteine availability fall short, failing to efficiently block cysteine metabolism due to inadequate tumor targeting and compensatory cysteine sources. Inspired by sulfur&#8208;metabolizing bacteria, synthetic biology to develop an engineered bacterium capable of directly depleting cysteine to block its metabolism is used. Acting as a living drug, these engineered bacteria colonize the tumor and continuously produce engineered cyst(e)inase enzyme (CGL) under the stimulation of tumor hypoxia. The CGL exhausts the substrate cysteine, completely impeding cysteine metabolism. This process dismantles the ferroptosis defense system in PDAC cells, triggers potent ferroptosis, and achieves efficient treatment. The results demonstrate that engineered bacteria designed for cysteine metabolism modulation possess unparalleled advantages in efficacy, persistence, and precision in blocking cysteine metabolism, making them highly suitable for effective ferroptosis treatment of PDAC.

         <title>Enhanced Synaptic Memory Window and Linearity in Planar In2Se3 Ferroelectric Junctions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D vdW &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; is used as a ferroelectric tunneling junction in a planar structure with Au electrodes. The interface between the &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; semiconductor and the Au electrode is studied to achieve a large on/off ratio by inserting a SiO&#8322; insulating barrier. The polarization of &#945;&#8208;In&#8322;Se&#8323; gradually changes with the applied pulses, mimicking synaptic properties and exhibiting linear LTP/LTD behavior.








Abstract
A synaptic memristor using 2D ferroelectric junctions is a promising candidate for future neuromorphic computing with ultra&#8208;low power consumption, parallel computing, and adaptive scalable computing technologies. However, its utilization is restricted due to the limited operational voltage memory window and low on/off current (ION/OFF) ratio of the memristor devices. Here, it is demonstrated that synaptic operations of 2D In2Se3 ferroelectric junctions in a planar memristor architecture can reach a voltage memory window as high as 16&#160;V (&#177;8 V) and ION/OFF ratio of 108, significantly higher than the current literature values. The power consumption is 10&#8722;5&#160;W at the on state, demonstrating low power usage while maintaining a large ION/OFF ratio of 108 compared to other ferroelectric devices. Moreover, the developed ferroelectric junction mimicked synaptic plasticity through pulses in the pre&#8208;synapse. The nonlinearity factors are obtained 1.25 for LTP, &#8722;0.25 for LTD, respectively. The single&#8208;layer perceptron (SLP) and convolutional neural network (CNN) on&#8208;chip training results in an accuracy of up to 90%, compared to the 91% in an ideal synapse device. Furthermore, the incorporation of a 3&#160;nm thick SiO2 interface between the &#945;&#8208;In2Se3 and the Au electrode resulted in ultrahigh performance among other 2D ferroelectric junction devices to date.

         <title>Highly Oriented WS2 Monolayers for High&#8208;Performance Electronics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Wafer&#8208;scale, highly oriented (almost monocrystalline) WS2 monolayers are synthesized on C/A&#8208;plane sapphire substrates by chemical vapor deposition. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is achieved based on field&#8208;effect transistors made of such films, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025.








Abstract
2D&#160;transition&#8208;metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) semiconductors represent the most promising channel materials for post&#8208;silicon microelectronics due to their unique structure and electronic properties. However, it remains challenging to synthesize wide&#8208;bandgap TMDCs monolayers featuring large areas and high performance simultaneously. Herein, highly oriented WS2 monolayers are reproducibly synthesized through a templated growth strategy on vicinal C/A&#8208;plane sapphire wafers. Various spectroscopic characterizations confirm the high crystallographic orientation and uniformity across the entire wafers. Electronic measurements for samples transferred onto SiO2/Si substrates reveal high average field&#8208;effect mobilities of 62 and 180 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1 at room temperature and 8 K, respectively. On hexagonal boron nitride substrates, these mobilities increase to 94 and 473 cm2V&#8722;1s&#8722;1, respectively. A record high saturation current density of 675&#160;&#181;A&#160;&#181;m&#8722;1 is observed, outperforming the index required for high&#8208;density integration circuits in IRDS 2025. This work paves the way for the application of wide&#8208;bandgap TMDC monolayers in post&#8208;silicon electronics.

         <title>High&#8208;Performance Green and Blue Light&#8208;Emitting Diodes Enabled by CdZnSe/ZnS Core/Shell Colloidal Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new synthesis strategy for CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum wells, which covers the green and blue spectral range and exhibits exceptional photoelectric properties, is achieved by direct cation exchange from Cd to Zn and hot&#8208;injection shell growth. This enables the fabrication of high&#8208;performance green and blue light&#8208;emitting diodes with the peak external quantum efficiencies of 20.4% and 10.6%.








Abstract
The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal&#8208;based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions are tailored via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot&#8208;injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled the successful fabrication green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution&#8208;processed CQW&#8208;LEDs. The devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for green and 38,063&#160;cd m&#8722;2 for blue. The high&#8208;performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal&#8208;based light&#8208;emitting diodes (Nc&#8208;LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals.

&lt;p&gt;A new synthesis strategy for CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell colloidal quantum wells, which covers the green and blue spectral range and exhibits exceptional photoelectric properties, is achieved by direct cation exchange from Cd to Zn and hot-injection shell growth. This enables the fabrication of high-performance green and blue light-emitting diodes with the peak external quantum efficiencies of 20.4% and 10.6%.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The unique anisotropic properties of colloidal quantum wells (CQWs) make them highly promising as components in nanocrystal-based devices. However, the limited performance of green and blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on CQWs has impeded their practical applications. In this study, alloy CdZnSe core CQWs with precise compositions are tailored via direct cation exchange (CE) from CdSe CQWs with specific size, shape, and crystal structure and utilized hot-injection shell (HIS) growth to synthesize CdZnSe/ZnS core/shell CQWs exhibiting exceptional optoelectronic characteristics. This approach enabled the successful fabrication green and blue LEDs manifesting superior performance compared to previously reported solution-processed CQW-LEDs. The devices demonstrated a remarkable peak external quantum efficiency (20.4% for green and 10.6% for blue), accompanied by a maximum brightness 347,683&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for green and 38,063&#160;cd m&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;2&lt;/sup&gt; for blue. The high-performance represents a significant advancement for nanocrystal-based light-emitting diodes (Nc-LEDs) incorporating anisotropic nanocrystals. This work provides a comprehensive synthesis strategy for enhancing the efficiency of Nc-LEDs utilizing anisotropic nanocrystals.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Photonic Supercoupling in Silicon Topological Waveguides</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Topological supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for the first time, enabling efficient waveguide coupling over separation distances ranging from sub&#8208;wavelength to multiple wavelengths, driven by the valley vortex wave in the topological valley Hall system. This approach aims at integrating increasing number of on&#8208;chip components to further enhance the chip compactness and density.








Abstract
Waveguide interconnect coupling control is essential for enhancing the chip density of photonic integrated circuits to incorporate a growing number of components. However, a critical engineering challenge is to achieve both strong waveguide isolation and efficient long&#8208;range coupling on a single chip. Here, a novel photonic supercoupling phenomenon is demonstrated for waveguide coupling over separation distances from a quarter to five wavelengths (&#955;), leveraging the tunable mode tails and the vortex energy flow in topological valley Hall system. A supercoupled integrated chip is developed, realizing a 91% coupling ratio and a &#8722;30&#160;dB isolation over 2.8&#955; waveguide separations simultaneously. Supercoupled devices are further showcased including a waveguide&#8208;cavity system with 3.2&#955; excitation distance, and a waveguide directional supercoupler with a compact coupling area of nearly &#955;2/4, which outperform conventional devices. Supercoupling provides new degrees of freedom for optimizing coupling and isolation between photonic integrated components, facilitating new applications in on&#8208;chip sensing, lasing, and telecommunications.

         <title>Quinoidal Semiconductor Nanoparticles for NIR&#8208;II Photoacoustic Imaging and Photoimmunotherapy of Cancer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The newly developed nanopolymer, constructed from quinoidal acceptor&#8211;donor&#8211;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) structured organic molecules, exhibits excellent near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light absorption, phototherapy, and photoacoustic imaging performance. Combined with the immunomodulator R848, it efficiently treats primary ovarian tumors, inhibits metastatic tumors, and also demonstrates promising efficacy in breast cancer treatment.








Abstract
Photoagents with ultra&#8208;high near&#8208;infrared II (NIR&#8208;II) light energy conversion efficiency hold great promise in tumor phototherapy due to their ability to penetrate deeper tissues and minimize damage to surrounding healthy cells. However, the development of NIR&#8208;II photoagents remain challenging. In this study, an all&#8208;fused&#8208;ring quinoidal acceptor&#8208;donor&#8208;acceptor (A&#8208;D&#8208;A) molecule, SKCN, with a BTP core is synthesized, and nanoparticles named FA&#8208;SNPs are prepared. The unique quinoidal structure enhances &#960;&#8208;electron delocalization and bond length uniformity, significantly reducing the bandgap of SKCN, resulting in strong NIR&#8208;II absorption, a high molar extinction coefficient, and a photothermal conversion efficiency of 75.14%. Enhanced molecular rigidity also facilitates efficient energy transfer to oxygen, boosting reactive oxygen species generation. By incorporating the immunomodulator R848, FA&#8208;SRNPs nanoparticles are further developed, effectively modulating the tumor immune microenvironment by reducing Tregs and M&#8208;MDSCs infiltration, promoting dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and activating CD8+ T cells and NK cells. Comprehensive studies using orthotopic ovarian cancer models demonstrated strong tumor targeting, photoacoustic imaging capabilities, and significant tumor suppression and metastasis inhibition, and also showing excellent therapeutic efficacy in an orthotopic breast cancer model. This study provides strong evidence for the potential application of quinoidal A&#8208;D&#8208;A molecules in cancer photoimmunotherapy.

         <title>A Universal Solid&#8208;Phase Synthetic Strategy for Ultrafine Intermetallic Libraries Confined in Ordered Mesoporous Carbon</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This manuscript reports a solid&#8208;phase route to prepare ultrafine intermetallic libraries confined in ordered mesoporous carbon by a strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates. The intermetallic catalyst discloses remarkably high activity and stability in oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions.








Abstract
Ordered intermetallic nanocatalysts supported on high&#8208;surface&#8208;area skeletons are of great importance in catalysis and have disclosed notable catalytic activity and stability that are remarkably better than their random alloy counterparts. Ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts are synthetically challenging, especially for universal and scaled&#8208;up synthesis, because of inevitable sintering and phase separation under high temperatures that promote atomic alloying and ordering. Herein, a universal solid&#8208;phase and scaled&#8208;up method is reported for synthesizing ultrafine intermetallic nanocatalysts with uniform size distributions and wide compositional spaces confined in ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) supports, where the strong physical confinement and chemical interaction between metals and sulfur/mesoporous templates remarkably suppress the high&#8208;temperature sintering and phase separation even up to 1000&#160;&#176;C. Libraries of intermetallic nanocatalysts are successfully synthesized including 52 combinations of host platinum/palladium/rhodium with 15 guest elements confined in 4 OMC supports. Taking oxygen reduction and hydrogen evolution reactions as examples, the intermetallic PtFe nanocatalysts hold remarkable performance, whose activities reach up to ten times higher than commercial Pt/C and also are comparable to the best electrocatalysts reported recently. This feasible synthetic strategy offers an intermetallic library spanning from binary to senary materials for industrial synthesis and applications.

         <title>Nanozymes and Their Potential Roles in the Origin of Life</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 6, February 12, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Nanozymes, as enzyme mimics, demonstrate not only enzyme&#8208;like structures and activities but also high stability and regulated catalytic functions. Minerals are also known for catalytic roles in the origin of life. Building on this foundation, this study proposes that nanozymes may serve as highly efficient pre&#8208;enzymatic catalysts, potentially participating in the transition from inorganic molecules to primitive cells in chemical evolution.









Abstract
The origin of life has long been a central scientific challenge, with various hypotheses proposed. The chemical evolution, which supposes that inorganic molecules can transform into organic molecules and subsequent primitive cells, laid the foundation for modern theories. Inorganic minerals are believed to play crucial catalytic roles in the process. However, the harsh reaction conditions of inorganic minerals hinder the accumulation of organic molecules, preventing the efficient transition from inorganic molecules to biomacromolecules. Given the inherent physicochemical properties and enzyme&#8208;like activities, this study proposes that nanozymes, nanomaterials with enzyme&#8208;like activities, act as efficient prebiotic catalysts in the origin of life. This hypothesis is based on the following: First, unlike traditional minerals, nanominerals can catalyze organic synthesis under milder conditions. Second, nanominerals can not only protect biomolecules from radiation damage but also catalyze polymerization reactions to form functional biomacromolecules and further lipid vesicles. More importantly, nanominerals are abundant in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments. This perspective will systematically discuss the potential roles of nanozymes in the emergence of life based on the functions of minerals and the characteristics of nanozymes. We hope the research on nanozymes and the origin of life will bridge the gap between inorganic precursors and biomolecules under primitive environments.

         <title>Local Chemical Enhancement and Gating of Organic Coordinated Ionic&#8208;Electronic Transport</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction.








Abstract
Superior properties in organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductors (OMIECs) over inorganic counterparts have inspired intense interest in biosensing, soft&#8208;robotics, neuromorphic computing, and smart medicine. However, slow ion transport relative to charge transport in these materials is a limiting factor. Here, it is demonstrated that hydrophilic molecules local to an interfacial OMIEC nanochannel can accelerate ion transport with ion mobilities surpassing electrophoretic transport by more than an order of magnitude. Furthermore, ion access to this interfacial channel can be gated through local surface energy. This mechanism is applied in a novel sensing device, which electronically detects and characterizes chemical reaction dynamics local to the buried channel. The ability to enhance ion transport at the nanoscale in OMIECs as well as govern ion transport through local chemical signaling enables new functionalities for printable, stretchable, and biocompatible mixed conduction devices.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Resistance Photoluminescence Carbonized Polymer Dots Through Equilibrium Bi&#8208;Confinement Effects</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, bi&#8208;confinement effects arising from a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and rigid Al&#8322;O&#8323; matrix are exploited to achieve ultra&#8208;stable carbonized polymer dots (CPDs). The obtained CPDs@Al2O3 composite demonstrates exceptional long&#8208;term stability in various solvents and high photoluminescence emission thermotolerance up to 500&#160;K for 150&#160;h, representing the best performance of carbon dots under harsh conditions reported to date.








Abstract
Carbon dots are emerging luminescent nanomaterials that have drawn considerable attention due to their abundance, environmental friendliness, and customizable optical properties. However, their susceptibility to temperature&#8208;induced vibrational exciton changes and the tendency to thermal quenching of emission have hindered their practical applications. Here, a method is reported for achieving high&#8208;temperature photoluminescence carbonized polymer dots (CPDs) through a bi&#8208;confinement approach that involves a highly cross&#8208;linked polymer network and a rigid Al2O3 matrix. As the temperature increased from 303 to 500&#160;K, the fluorescence and phosphorescence emission intensities of CPDs@Al2O3 remained virtually unchanged, with the emission duration exceeding 150&#160;h at 500&#160;K. Additionally, CPDs@Al2O3 composites with different degrees of carbonization exhibit dynamic excitation&#8208;dependent photoluminescence properties, which can be patterned for multiple information encryption application. This work provides a concept for designing stable and luminous CPDs under harsh conditions, thus expanding their potential application range.

         <title>Soft&#8208;Actuated Cuff Electrodes with Minimal Contact for Bidirectional Peripheral Interfaces</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) for bidirectional peripheral interfaces enable minimal and secure contact to the nerve through fluid injection&#8208;based soft actuation. A 3D bent structure can grasp and securely contact the nerves with only a little pressure (&lt;1.21 gram&#8208;force). The SACE can achieve negligible damage to the nerve during recording of sensory and motor feedback signals with superior SNR and neuromodulation for long&#8208;term studies.








Abstract
Neural interfaces with embedded electrical functions, such as cuff electrodes, are essential for monitoring and stimulating peripheral nerves. Still, several challenges remain with cuff electrodes because sutured devices can damage the nerve by high pressure and the secured contact of electrodes with the nerve is hard to accomplish, which however is essential in maintaining electrical performance. Here, a sutureless soft&#8208;actuated cuff electrodes (SACE) that can envelop the nerve conveniently by creating a bent shape controlled upon fluid injection, is introduced. Moreover, fluid injection protrudes part of the device where electrodes are formed, thereby achieving minimized, soft but secure contact between the electrodes and the nerve. In vivo results demonstrate the successful recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves over time up to 6 weeks. While securing contact with the nerve, the implanted electrodes can preserve the nerve intact with no reduction in blood flow, thereby indicating only minimal compressive force applied to the nerve. The SACE is expected to be a promising tool for recording and stimulation of peripheral nerves toward bidirectional neuroprostheses.

A robust photo&#8208;/electrothermal icephobic surface with dynamic phase&#8208;transition micro&#8208;nanostructures has been developed through laser microfabrication and surface engineering. The engineered surface demonstrates highly efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance, as well as exceptional superhydrophobicity. A key breakthrough is the resolution of the mechanical interlocking issue, a common challenge for the practical application of superhydrophobic surfaces in anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing.








Abstract
Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces present a promising energy&#8208;saving solution for anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing, offering effective icing delay and photothermal de&#8208;icing capabilities.

The engineered surface exhibits ultra&#8208;efficient, long&#8208;term stable anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing performance and excellent superhydrophobicity, demonstrating an icing delay of &#8776; 1250 s, photothermal de&#8208;icing in 8 s, water contact angle of 165&#176;, and sliding angle of 0.2&#176;. Furthermore, the surface maintains efficient anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing ability and water repellency after 400 linear abrasion cycles under 0.93&#160;MPa. Remarkably, under simulated natural icing conditions, where water vapor freezes within the micro&#8208;nanostructures causing mechanical interlocking, the surface remains entirely non&#8208;wetted after photo&#8208;/electrothermal de&#8208;icing, maintaining superhydrophobicity and effectiveness for continued anti&#8208;/de&#8208;icing.

         <title>Scalable Multistep Roll&#8208;to&#8208;Roll Printing of Multifunctional and Robust Reentrant Microcavity Surfaces via a Wetting&#8208;Induced Process</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The multifunctionality of reentrant microcavity geometries for different materials is investigated, and a novel and efficient method for fabricating such geometry is proposed by analyzing capillary fluid behavior. This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.








Abstract
Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll&#160;printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting&#8208;induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray&#8208;coated ultraviolet&#8208;curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low&#8208;surface&#8208;tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost&#8208;effective and high&#8208;throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti&#8208;icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.

This approach addresses the limitations of existing methods to provide a cost-effective and high-throughput solution for generating multifunctional reentrant surfaces, which is expected to be utilized in various fields.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Owing to their unique structural robustness, interconnected reentrant structures offer multifunctionality for various applications. a scalable multistep roll-to-roll&#160;printing method is proposed for fabricating reentrant microcavity surfaces, coined as wetting-induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process. The key to the proposed WING process is a highly reproducible reentrant structure formation controlled by the capillary action during contact between prefabricated microcavity structure and spray-coated ultraviolet-curable resins. It demonstrates the superior liquid repellency of the WING structures, which maintain large contact angles even with low-surface-tension liquids, and their robust capability to retain solid particles and liquids under external forces. In addition, the scalable and continuous fabrication approach addresses the limitations of existing methods, providing a cost-effective and high-throughput solution for creating multifunctional reentrant surfaces for anti-icing, biofouling prevention, and particle capture.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Tailorable Fluorescent Perovskite Quantum Dots for Multiform Manufacturing via Two&#8208;Step Thiol&#8208;Ene Click Chemistry</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is introduced for the tailorable fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (T&#8208;PQDs). A protective shell is formed around the PQDs in the first step, while chemical cross&#8208;linking between PQD and thiol&#8208;ene polymer occurs in the second step. The T&#8208;PQDs offer high efficiency, stability, and processability, facilitating their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.








Abstract
In practical applications, fluorescent perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) must exhibit high efficiency, stability, and processibility. So far, it remains a challenge to synthesize PQDs with stable dispersibility in tailorable monomers both before and after photocuring. In this work, a novel strategy of UV&#8208;induced two&#8208;step thiol&#8208;ene &#8220;click chemistry&#8221; is proposed to prepare PQDs with these attributes. The first step aims to epitaxially grow a shell around the PQD core to ensure stable dispersibility in a thiol&#8208;ene monomer solution. The second step is to achieve stable dispersibility in the photocured thiol&#8208;ene matrixes for multiform manufacturing processes. The tailorable PQDs (T&#8208;PQDs) not only have the highest photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) to &#8776;100% for green emission and over 96% for red emission, but also exhibit remarkable stability under severe conditions, including &#8220;double 85&#8221; aging, water exposure, and mechanical stress. Moreover, their exceptional processability allows for various processing techniques, including slot&#8208;die coating, inkjet printing, direct&#8208;laser writing, UV&#8208;light 3D printing, nanoimprinting, and spin coating. The high efficiency and stability of T&#8208;PQDs facilitate their multiform manufacturing for a wide range of applications.

         <title>Multiscale Manufacturing of Recyclable Polyimide Composite Aerogels</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. A recycling strategy is guided by molecular simulation to reach recycling of high&#8208;performance polyimide&#8208;based aerogels. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). The unique combination facilitates the sustainable utilization of outstanding aerogel composites in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.








Abstract
Mitigating embodied emissions is becoming increasingly crucial as the energy supply shifts toward more sustainable sources. Bio&#8208;based materials present a potentially more sustainable alternative to synthetic polymers; however, it often do not yet match the performance of synthetic materials. Given the ongoing reliance on high&#8208;performance, high&#8208;environmental&#8208;impact materials, it is essential to ensure their complete recyclability. Aerogels, recognized by IUPAC as one of the top ten emerging technologies, are witnessing rapid market growth in thermal insulation and thermal protection applications. In certain applications, synthetic and composite aerogels exhibit superior performance, particularly under high temperatures. Here, molecular simulation tools are employed to elucidate the interaction forces between polymers and solvents, develop a recycling strategy for polyimide&#8208;based aerogels, and demonstrate their application in thermal protection for firefighter textiles and thermal runaway protection for Li&#8208;ion battery packs. These composites are engineered for disassembly, allowing for the complete recovery of starting materials without any degradation of components after multiple recycling cycles. The recyclable composites can be fabricated using various manufacturing techniques to produce fibers (1D), membranes (2D), and complex structures (3D). This unique combination of outstanding performance and excellent recyclability facilitates the sustainable utilization of aerogels in protective clothing, electric mobility, consumer goods, and aeronautics.

         <title>Stretchable Multimodal Photonic Sensor for Wearable Multiparameter Health Monitoring</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH is developed for on&#8208;skin health monitoring. By integrating multiple sensing mechanisms in a single hydrogel&#8208;coated PDMS optical fiber (HPOF) at distinct wavelengths, the device achieves simultaneous monitoring of heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time with negligible crosstalk.








Abstract
Stretchable sensors that can conformally interface with the skins for wearable and real&#8208;time monitoring of skin deformations, temperature, and sweat biomarkers offer critical insights for early disease prediction and diagnosis. Integration of multiple modalities in a single stretchable sensor to simultaneously detect these stimuli would provide a more comprehensive understanding of human physiology, which, however, has yet to be achieved. Here, this work reports, for the first time, a stretchable multimodal photonic sensor capable of simultaneously detecting and discriminating strain deformations, temperature, and sweat pH. The multimodal sensing abilities are enabled by realization of multiple sensing mechanisms in a hydrogel&#8208;coated polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) optical fiber (HPOF), featured with high flexibility, stretchability, and biocompatibility. The integrated mechanisms are designed to operate at distinct wavelengths to facilitate stimuli decoupling and employ a ratiometric detection strategy for improved robustness and accuracy. To simplify sensor interrogation, spectrally&#8208;resolved multiband emissions are generated upon the excitation of a single&#8208;wavelength laser, utilizing upconversion luminescence (UCL) and radiative energy transfer (RET) processes. As proof of concept, this work demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneous monitoring of the heartbeat, respiration, body temperature, and sweat pH of a person in real&#8208;time, with only a single sensor.

         <title>An Adaptive Metal&#8211;Organic Framework Discriminates Xylene Isomers by Shape&#8208;Responsive Deformation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A shape&#8208;responsive MOF is employed to discern subtle shape differences among xylene isomers. The adsorbent deforms adaptively to match the shapes of isomer molecules, translating these diverse shapes into characteristic deformation energies. With &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where deformation energy scales with the mismatch between molecular shape and pore geometry, the adsorbent energetically favors PX over other isomers, thereby achieving energy&#8208;sieving of xylene isomers.









Abstract
The separation of xylene isomers, especially para&#8208;xylene, is a crucial but challenging process in the chemical industry due to their similar molecular dimensions. Here, a flexible metal&#8211;organic framework, Ni(ina)2, (ina = isonicotinic acid) is employed to effectively discriminate xylene isomers. The adsorbent with adaptive deformation accommodates the shapes of isomer molecules, thereby translating their subtle shape differences into characteristic framework deformation energies. Through a combination of multiple local flexibility behaviors, Ni(ina)2 exhibits guest&#8208;specific structural transformations that energetically favor para&#8208;xylene over other isomers. Single&#8208;crystal X&#8208;ray diffraction, in situ powder X&#8208;ray diffraction, and theoretical investigations validate this &#8220;adaptive fitting&#8221; mechanism, where the degree of structural deformation scales with the mismatch between the molecular shape and pore geometry. As a result, Ni(ina)2 achieves exceptional para&#8208;xylene selectivity in both liquid and vapor phase separations, maintaining a high para&#8208;xylene purity and productivity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy of exploiting framework flexibility to address challenging molecular separations and provides fresh insights into the design of selective adsorbents.

Wetting&#8208;Induced Process
The wetting&#8208;induced interconnected reentrant geometry (WING) process enables the large&#8208;scale fabrication of multifunctional re&#8208;entrant microcavity surfaces, representing a significant technological advancement. Utilizing capillary action in a scalable roll&#8208;to&#8208;roll printing technique, it produces surfaces with exceptional liquid repellency while maintaining microstructures under external forces. This process offers a cost&#8208;effective and high throughput solution for various applications, such as anti&#8208;icing, anti&#8208;fouling, and particle capture. More details can be found in article number 2411064 by Seok Kim, Young Tae Cho, and co&#8208;workers.

Polymorphing Hydrogels &#8211; Sculpting with Light
Polymorphing hydrogels can be reshaped on demand by shining light on specific areas. These hydrogels incorporate photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links, whose lengths are reversibly controlled by UV or visible light. Under UV illumination, the cross&#8208;links shorten, causing the hydrogel to contract, while exposure to visible light restores their original length. The image symbolizes this process by depicting a &#8220;VIS&#8221;ible man and &#8220;UV&#8221;men working together to sculpt the material. More details can be found in article number 2414648 by Eunjin Choi, Yeongjae Choi, and co&#8208;workers.

Record ion mobility and conductivities are revealed within a nanoscopic interfacial superhighway of an organic mixed ionic&#8208;electronic conductor. Fast ion transport can be controlled by hydrophobicity of molecules local to this channel, effectively gating ion access to the superhighway. This mechanism is used in a novel chemical sensing device which detects the dynamics of a local, buried chemical reaction. More details can be found in article number 2406281 by Tamanna Khan, Terry McAfee, Thomas J. Ferron, Awwad Alotaibi, and Brian A. Collins.

Abstract
The efficient mitigation of harmful nitrogen oxides (NOx) under ambient conditions remains a challenging task. Selective adsorption offers a viable solution for the capture of low&#8208;concentration NOx from the polluted stream at low temperatures. This review summarizes recent progress in the development of NO2 adsorbents, delves into the understanding of adsorption mechanisms, and discusses the criteria for evaluating their performance. First, the present NO2 adsorbents are categorized according to their distinct characteristics. This review then provides insights into the mechanisms of adsorption, highlighting the interaction between active sites and NO2, drawing from both experimental and theoretical research. The performance of these adsorbents is also assessed, focusing on their capacity, reusability, stability and selectivity. Finally, perspectives are proposed to address the significant challenges and explore potential advancements for NO2 adsorbents, aiming to enhance their suitability for diverse practical application scenarios.

         <title>Hierarchically Promoted Light Harvesting and Management in Photothermal Solar Steam Generation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review examines the critical role of multi&#8208;scale hierarchical structures, from molecular to macro levels, in optimizing light harvesting and photothermal efficiency in solar steam generation (SSG) systems. By tailoring materials and structures to enhance light absorption, manage thermal properties, and support effective water transport, these integrated designs advance solar&#8208;thermal desalination as a sustainable solution to water scarcity.








Abstract
Solar steam generation (SSG) presents a promising approach to addressing the global water crisis. Central to SSG is solar photothermal conversion that requires efficient light harvesting and management. Hierarchical structures with multi&#8208;scale light management are therefore crucial for SSG. At the molecular and sub&#8208;nanoscale levels, materials are fine&#8208;tuned for broadband light absorption. Advancing to the nano&#8208; and microscale, structures are tailored to enhance light harvesting through internal reflections, scattering, and diverse confinement effects. At the macroscopic level, light capture is optimized through rationally designed device geometries, configurations, and arrangements of solar absorber materials. While the performance of SSG relies on various factors including heat transport, physicochemical interactions at the water/air and material/water interfaces, salt dynamics, etc., efficient light capture and utilization holds a predominant role because sunlight is the sole energy source. This review focuses on the critical, yet often underestimated, role of hierarchical light harvesting/management at different dimensional scales in SSG. By correlating light management with the structure&#8208;property relationships, the recent advances in SSG are discussed, shedding light on the current challenges and possible future trends and opportunities in this domain.

         <title>Linking Nanoscopic Insights to Millimetric&#8208;Devices in Formamidinium&#8208;Rich Perovskite Photovoltaics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review sheds light on the most detrimental nanoscopic phase impurities in FA&#8208;rich perovskite PVs and further, highlights research directions that can mitigate their formation in the final films. The objective is to provide fundamental guidelines for engineering state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art FA&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers pairing exceptional performance and prolonged device stability.








Abstract
Halide&#8208;perovskite semiconductors have a high potential for use in single&#8208;junction and tandem solar cells. Despite their unprecedented rise in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for photovoltaic (PV) applications, it remains unclear whether perovskite solar modules can reach a sufficient operational lifetime. In order to make perovskite solar cells (PSCs) commercially viable, a fundamental understanding of the relationship between their nanostructure, optoelectronic properties, device efficiency, and long&#8208;term operational stability/reliability needs to be established. In this review, the phase instabilities in state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art formamidinium (FA)&#8208;rich perovskite absorbers is discussed. Furthermore, the concerted efforts are summarized in this prospect, covering aspects from fundamental research to device engineering. Subsequently, a critical analysis of the dictating impact of the nanoscale landscape of perovskite materials on their resulting intrinsic stability is provided. Finally, the remaining challenges in the field are assessed and future research directions are proposed for improving the operational lifetimes of perovskite devices. It is believed that these approaches, which bridge nanoscale structural properties to working solar cell devices, will be critical to assessing the realization of a bankable PSC product.

         <title>Recent Progress and Challenges of Li&#8208;Rich Mn&#8208;Based Cathode Materials for Solid&#8208;State Lithium&#8208;Ion Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The review explores the potential of Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathodes in next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion and all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries, addressing their challenges, and degradation mechanisms, and proposing strategies for improvement and future research directions.








Abstract
Li&#8208;rich Mn&#8208;based (LRM) cathode materials, characterized by their high specific capacity (&gt;250 mAh g&#8722;&#185;) and cost&#8208;effectiveness, represent promising candidates for next&#8208;generation lithium&#8208;ion batteries. However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all&#8208;solid&#8208;state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid&#8211;liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering.

     alt="Recent Progress and Challenges of Li-Rich Mn-Based Cathode Materials for Solid-State Lithium-Ion Batteries"/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The review explores the potential of Li-rich Mn-based (LRM) cathodes in next-generation lithium-ion and all-solid-state batteries, addressing their challenges, and degradation mechanisms, and proposing strategies for improvement and future research directions.

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Abstract&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Li-rich Mn-based (LRM) cathode materials, characterized by their high specific capacity (&amp;gt;250 mAh g&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;&lt;/sup&gt;&#185;) and cost-effectiveness, represent promising candidates for next-generation lithium-ion batteries. However, their commercial application is hindered by rapid capacity degradation and voltage fading, which can be attributed to transition metal migration, lattice oxygen release, and the toxicity of Mn ions to the anode solid electrolyte interphase (SEI). Recently, the application of LRM cathode in all-solid-state batteries (ASSBs) has garnered significant interest, as this approach eliminates the liquid electrolyte, thereby suppressing transition metal crosstalk and solid&#8211;liquid interfacial side reactions. This review first examines the historical development, crystal structure, and mechanisms underlying the high capacity of LRM cathode materials. It then introduces the current challenges facing LRM cathode and the associated degradation mechanisms and proposes solutions to these issues. Additionally, it summarizes recent research on LRM materials in ASSBs and suggests strategies for improvement. Finally, the review discusses future research directions for LRM cathode materials, including optimized material design, bulk doping, surface coating, developing novel solid electrolytes, and interface engineering. This review aims to provide further insights and new perspectives on applying LRM cathode materials in ASSBs.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Advanced Ruthenium&#8208;Based Electrocatalysts for NOx Reduction to Ammonia</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review offers an in&#8208;depth overview of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art advances in the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction to NH3, covering the mechanism, design, and applications. Additionally, the review presents the primary challenges relevant to relatively high cost, complex reaction mechanism, and serious hydrogen evolution, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.








Abstract
Ammonia (NH3) is widely recognized as a crucial raw material for nitrogen&#8208;based fertilizer production and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen&#8208;rich fuels. Currently, the Haber&#8211;Bosch process still dominates the worldwide industrial NH3 production, which consumes substantial energy and contributes to enormous CO2 emission. As an alternative NH3 synthesis route, electrocatalytic reduction of NOx species (NO3&#8722;, NO2&#8722;, and NO) to NH3 has gained considerable attention due to its advantages such as flexibility, low power consumption, sustainability, and environmental friendliness. This review timely summarizes an updated and critical survey of mechanism, design, and application of Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts for NOx reduction. First, the reason why the Ru&#8208;based catalysts are good choice for NOx reduction to NH3 is presented. Second, the reaction mechanism of NOx over Ru&#8208;based materials is succinctly summarized. Third, several typical in situ characterization techniques, theoretical calculations, and kinetics analysis are examined. Subsequently, the construction of each classification of the Ru&#8208;based electrocatalysts according to the size of particles and compositions is critically reviewed. Apart from these, examples are given on the applications in the production of valuable chemicals and Zn&#8722;NOx batteries. Finally, this review concludes with a summary highlighting the main practical challenges relevant to selectivity and efficiency in the broad range of NOx concentrations and the high currents, as well as the critical perspectives on the fronter of this exciting research area.

It is crucial to gain a deep understanding of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials to enhance targeting precision and therapeutic outcomes. This review focuses on recent advances in these materials and their role in improving catalytic immunotherapy, paving the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapy.








Abstract
Cancer immunotherapy holds significant promise for improving cancer treatment efficacy; however, the low response rate remains a considerable challenge. To overcome this limitation, advanced catalytic materials offer potential in augmenting catalytic immunotherapy by modulating the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME) through precise biochemical reactions. Achieving optimal targeting precision and therapeutic efficacy necessitates a thorough understanding of the properties and underlying mechanisms of tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials. This review provides a comprehensive and systematic overview of recent advancements in tumor&#8208;targeted catalytic materials and their critical role in enhancing catalytic immunotherapy. It highlights the types of catalytic reactions, the construction strategies of catalytic materials, and their fundamental mechanisms for tumor targeting, including passive, bioactive, stimuli&#8208;responsive, and biomimetic targeting approaches. Furthermore, this review outlines various tumor&#8208;specific targeting strategies, encompassing tumor tissue, tumor cell, exogenous stimuli&#8208;responsive, TME&#8208;responsive, and cellular TME targeting strategies. Finally, the discussion addresses the challenges and future perspectives for transitioning catalytic materials into clinical applications, offering insights that pave the way for next&#8208;generation cancer therapies and provide substantial benefits to patients in clinical settings.

         <title>Enhancing Membrane Materials for Efficient Li Recycling and Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This review article systematically explores the recent advances in the membrane processes for lithium cycling and recovery, offering the first correlation between these technologies and technology readiness levels, unveiling the fundamentals for the lithium separation, and providing insights into the future design of membrane materials from both academic and industrial perspectives.








Abstract
Rapid uptake of lithium&#8208;centric technology, e.g., electric vehicles and large&#8208;scale energy storage, is increasing the demand for efficient technologies for lithium extraction from aqueous sources. Among various lithium&#8208;extraction technologies, membrane processes hold great promise due to energy efficiency and flexible operation in a continuous process with potential commercial viability. However, membrane separators face challenges such as the extraction efficiency due to the limited selectivity toward lithium relative to other species. Low selectivity can be ascribed to the uncontrollable selective channels and inefficient exclusion functions. However, recent selectivity enhancements for other membrane applications, such as in gas separation and energy storage, suggest that this may also be possible for lithium extraction. This review article focuses on the innovations in the membrane chemistries based on rational design following separation principles and unveiling the theories behind enhanced selectivity. Furthermore, recent progress in membrane&#8208;based lithium extraction technologies is summarized with the emphasis on inorganic, organic, and composite materials. The challenges and opportunities for developing the next generation of selective membranes for lithium recovery are also pointed out.

         <title>Electrical Spin State Manipulation in All&#8208;Magnet Heterojunctions Using a Ferromagnetic Spin Source</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Electrical manipulation of spins by spin Hall current from heavy metals facilitates the implementation of multifunctional spintronic devices. This work reports direct evidence of spin current generation in ferromagnets via observation of efficient current&#8208;induced switching of noncollinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet structure. The further realization of field&#8208;free switching suggests the ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources.








Abstract
The ability to electrically manipulate spin states in magnetic materials is essential for the advancement of energy&#8208;efficient spintronic device, which is typically achieved in systems composed of a spin source and a magnetic target, where the magnetic state of the target is altered by a charge current. While theories suggest that ferromagnets could function as more versatile spin sources, direct experimental studies involving only the spin source and target layers have been lacking. Here electrical manipulation of spin states in noncolinear antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using ferromagnets (Ni, Fe, NiFe, CoFeB) as the spin sources is reported. Both field&#8208;free switching and switching with an assistive field are achieved in Mn3Sn/ferromagnet bilayers, where the switching polarity correlates with the sign of anomalous Hall effect of the ferromagnets. The experimental findings can be accounted for by the presence of spin currents arising from spin&#8208;dependent scattering within the ferromagnets. This finding provides valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms of spin&#8208;conversion in ferromagnets, offering an alternative spin source for novel technological applications.

         <title>A Novel Matrix&#8208;Free Hyperfluorescent System Based on Anti&#8208;Quenching TADF Host for High Color Purity MR&#8208;TADF Emitters</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study proposes an advanced design concept for matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent systems, utilizing anti&#8208;quenching TADF materials as hosts to overcome aggregation&#8208;induced challenges in traditional MR&#8208;TADF emitters by regulating the energy transfer process. Importantly, this strategy avoids complex chemical modifications of MR&#8208;TADF emitters, making them universal and low&#8208;cost, which will greatly promote the commercialization of hyperfluorescent OLEDs.








Abstract
Organic light&#8208;emitting diodes (OLEDs) based on hyperfluorescent system have attracted widespread attention due to their ability to simultaneously achieve improvements in efficiency, lifetime, and color purity by combining the advantages of high exciton utilization sensitizers and high&#8208;color purity emitters. Traditional hyperfluorescent systems typically involve three or four components and are severely sensitive to the doping concentration (&#8776;0.5 wt%) of a terminal emitter, which inevitably causes high costs and difficulties in reproducibility. Here, a novel design concept for a matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent (MFHF) system that employs a combination of an anti&#8208;quenching TADF host and a high color purity MR&#8208;TADF emitter is proposed. This strategy allows traditional concentration&#8208;sensitive MR&#8208;TADF emitters to significantly improve exciton utilization and reduce exciton lifetime at high doping levels, without the need for complex molecular modifications. The OLEDs with binary emissive layer achieve pure&#8208;green emission, a maximum external quantum efficiency of over 30%, and a high maximum power efficiency of 145&#160;lm&#160;W&#8722;1. The approach offers a straightforward and universal method to achieve anti&#8208;quenching matrix&#8208;free hyperfluorescent OLEDs with high color purity, making them promising for commercial applications in low&#8208;cost ultra&#8208;high&#8208;definition (UHD) displays.

         <title>High&#8208;Capacity and Long&#8208;Life Aqueous Zn&#8208;SPAN Batteries with Tandem Catalysis</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A high&#8208;capacity and long&#8208;life of Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) battery is developed by a tandem catalytic electrolyte containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. The G4&#8211;I2 synergy activates efficient I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that inducing the generation of the predominant (002) plane.








Abstract
Aqueous zinc&#8211;sulfur batteries are a high&#8208;capacity and cost&#8208;effective energy storage technology. However, the performance is plagued by the dissolution of intermediate polysulfides formed during conversion. Here, this issue is addressed by developing aqueous rechargeable Zn&#8208;sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN) batteries using tandem catalytic systems, containing water and tetraglyme (G4) with iodine (I2) additives. Mechanistic study and experiments reveal that the fully conjugated molecular configurations circumvent the formation of soluble polysulfides and enable reversible co&#8208;storage of H+/Zn2+ with multiple redox&#8208;active centers. The reduced I2 by G4 activates I&#8722;/I3&#8722; redox couple in SPAN, reducing activation energy, and accelerating Zn&#8208;ion transfer kinetics. Additionally, it stabilizes the Zn anode by forming an organic&#8211;inorganic interphase that induces the generation of the predominant (002) plane. The as&#8208;assembled Zn&#8208;SPAN batteries exhibit excellent performances, with a high capacity of 1260.4 mAh g&#8722;1 at 0.2 A g&#8722;1, a high&#8208;rate performance (409.3 mAh g&#8722;1 at 5 A g&#8722;1), and a long cycling stability (81.8% capacity remained over 800 cycles at 2 A g&#8722;1). This work takes a crucial step forward in organosulfur compounds accompanied by multi&#8208;electron transfer for the high&#8208;performance aqueous zinc&#8208;ion batteries.

         <dc:description>
This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;) as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric for 2D semiconductor devices, offering a wide bandgap (&#8776;5.6 eV) and high dielectric constant (&#954;&#160;=&#160;13.5). KZBB/MoS&#8322; FETs demonstrate excellent performance, including steep subthreshold swing, high on/off ratio, minimal hysteresis, and low leakage, highlighting AZBX's potential for advanced 2D electronics.









Abstract
The development of dielectrics with atomic planes and van der Waals (vdW) interfaces is essential for enhancing the performance of 2D devices. However, vdW dielectrics often have smaller bandgaps compared to traditional 3D dielectrics, limiting their options. This study introduces AZBX (AZn&#8322;BO&#8323;X&#8322;, where A&#160;=&#160;K or Rb, X&#160;=&#160;Cl or Br), a nonlinear deep&#8208;ultraviolet optical crystal, as a quasi&#8208;vdW layered dielectric ideal for 2D electronic devices. Focusing on KZBB, it's excellent dielectric properties, including a wide bandgap, high dielectric constant (high&#8208;&#954;), and smooth interfaces are demonstrated. When used as the top gate dielectric in a KZBB/MoS&#8322; field&#8208;effect transistor (FET) with MoS&#8322; channels and graphene contacts, the device exhibits outstanding performance, with a steep subthreshold swing (&#8776; 73&#160;mV&#160;dec&#8722;1), high on/off ratio (&#8776; 10&#8311;), negligible hysteresis (0&#8211;8 mV), and stable, low leakage current (&#8776;10&#8315;&#8311; A&#160;cm&#8722;2) before breakdown. This work expands the 2D material and dielectric landscape and highlights the strong potential of AZBX as high&#8208;performance dielectrics.

         <title>Highly Efficient Synthesis of &#945;&#8208;Amino Acids via Electrocatalytic C&#8208;N Coupling Reaction Over an Atomically Dispersed Iron Loaded Defective TiO2</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids with a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2% is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.








Abstract
The synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids via the electrocatalytic C&#8208;N coupling attracted extensive attention owing to the mild reaction conditions, controllable reaction parameters, and atom economy. However, the &#945;&#8208;amino acid yield remains unsatisfying. Herein, the efficient electrocatalytic synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids is achieved with an atomically dispersed Fe loaded defective TiO2 monolithic electrocatalyst (adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti). The desired electrocatalyst composition for the hydrogenation of oxime is screened. The prepared adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti exhibited a high glyoxylic acid conversion of &#8776;100% and a glycine selectivity of 80.2%. The electrochemical experiments and theoretical calculations demonstrated that atomically dispersed Fe (adFe) sites and oxygen vacancies (OVs) enhanced the adsorption of glyoxylic acid (GA), glyoxylic oxime (GO), and nitrate (NO3&#8722;). adFe sites further promote the step of H2NO* &#8594; H2NOH* in the conversion of NO3&#8722; to hydroxylamine (NH2OH) and the step of NH&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* &#8594; NH2&#8208;CH2&#8208;COOH* in the reduction of GO to glycine. The coupling pathway and the critical intermediate are revealed by synchrotron radiation Fourier transform infrared (SR&#8208;FTIR) spectroscopy and differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS). Additionally, six other &#945;&#8208;amino acids are successfully synthesized by the adFe&#8208;TiOx/Ti, showcasing its versatility in the electrosynthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids. This work provides an efficient electrocatalyst for the C&#8208;N coupling synthesis of &#945;&#8208;amino acids.

         <title>Conjugation Chemistry Markedly Impacts Toxicity and Biodistribution of Targeted Nanoparticles, Mediated by Complement Activation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Conjugation chemistries are a critical technology in nanomedicine, enabling precise functionalization of nanoparticle surfaces (e.g., via attachment of targeting moieties). This work investigates how conjugation chemistry impacts nanoparticle&#8208;induced complement activation. The results demonstrate that modern conjugation chemistries, although bio&#8208;orthogonal, are not innocuous and must be chosen with opsonins like complement in mind.









Abstract
Conjugation chemistries are a major enabling technology for the development of drug delivery systems, from antibody&#8208;drug conjugates to antibody&#8208;targeted lipid nanoparticles inspired by the success of the COVID&#8208;19 vaccine. However, here it is shown that for antibody&#8208;targeted nanoparticles, the most popular conjugation chemistries directly participate in the activation of the complement cascade of plasma proteins. Their activation of complement leads to large changes in the biodistribution of nanoparticles (up to 140&#8208;fold increased uptake into phagocytes of the lungs) and multiple toxicities, including a 50% drop in platelet count. It is founded that the mechanism of complement activation varies dramatically between different conjugation chemistries. Dibenzocyclooctyne, a commonly used click&#8208;chemistry, caused aggregation of conjugated antibodies, but only on the surface of nanoparticles (not in bulk solution). By contrast, thiol&#8208;maleimide chemistry do not activate complement via its effects on antibodies, but rather because free maleimide bonded to albumin in plasma, and clustered albumin is then attacked by complement. Using these mechanistic insights, solutions are engineered that reduced the activation of complement for each class of conjugation chemistry. These results highlight that while conjugation chemistry is essential for the future of nanomedicine, it is not innocuous and must be designed with opsonins like complement in mind.

         <title>Matrix Viscoelasticity Controls Differentiation of Human Blood Vessel Organoids into Arterioles and Promotes Neovascularization in Myocardial Infarction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel method for differentiating arterioles in human blood vessel organoids is presented. Matrix viscoelasticity for hBVO vessel sprouting is manipulated by synthesizing dynamic and non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. Dynamic hydrogels stimulate angiogenesis in hBVOs, generate unique smooth muscle cells, and facilitate the formation of arterioles that contribute to neovascularization following a myocardial infarction.








Abstract
Stem cell&#8208;derived blood vessel organoids are embedded in extracellular matrices to stimulate vessel sprouting. Although vascular organoids in 3D collagen I&#8208;Matrigel gels are currently available, they are primarily capillaries composed of endothelial cells (ECs), pericytes, and mesenchymal stem&#8208;like cells, which necessitate mature arteriole differentiation for neovascularization. In this context, the hypothesis that matrix viscoelasticity regulates vascular development is investigated in 3D cultures by encapsulating blood vessel organoids within viscoelastic gelatin/&#946;&#8208;CD assembly dynamic hydrogels or methacryloyl gelatin non&#8208;dynamic hydrogels. The vascular organoids within the dynamic hydrogel demonstrate enhanced angiogenesis and differentiation into arterioles containing smooth muscle cells. The dynamic hydrogel mechanical microenvironment promotes vascular patterning and arteriolar differentiation by elevating notch receptor 3 signaling in mesenchymal stem cells and downregulating platelet&#8208;derived growth factor B expression in ECs. Transplantation of vascular organoids in vivo, along with the dynamic hydrogel, leads to the reassembly of arterioles and restoration of cardiac function in infarcted hearts. These findings indicate that the viscoelastic properties of the matrix play a crucial role in controlling the vascular organization and differentiation processes, suggesting an exciting potential for its application in regenerative medicine.

         <title>Chiton&#8208;Inspired Composites Synergizing Strength and Toughness Through Sinusoidal Interlocking Interfaces for Protective Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The chiton Lepidozona coreanica wisely uses the sinusoidal interlocking interface to make up for the short board of the cross&#8208;lamellar structures. Inspired by this, a chiton&#8208;inspired composite integrating cross&#8208;lamellar architecture and sinusoidal interlocking interface is proposed. The chiton&#8208;inspired composite has the high strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loads, and has promising application prospects in the field of protection.








Abstract
Introducing biological structures into materials design is expected to develop strong and tough structural materials. However, multiple interfaces are introduced simultaneously. They are always the weakest part of load transfer, becoming a critical vulnerability and failure&#8208;prone area. Here, it is the first found that the chiton achieves superior mechanical properties just by incorporating a unique sinusoidal interlocking interface into cross&#8208;lamellar architecture. These special interlocking interfaces make the chiton shell achieve damage delocalization and increase the resistance to crack initiation and propagation. Meanwhile, this &#8220;pre&#8208;engineered&#8221; path significantly increases the travel path of the cracks and balances the strength and toughness under quasi&#8208;static and impact loading. Inspired by this, a novel chiton&#8208;inspired composite is proposed. Through coupling the cross&#8208;lamellar structures and sinusoidal interlocking interfaces, its strength and toughness are increased by 88% and 107% under quasi&#8208;static loading, as well as by 17.8% and 52.4% under impact loading, respectively. These unusual interfaces make up the weak point of cross&#8208;lamellar structures and provide insights into the longer evolution of structural materials.

Ultimately, the nano&#8208;degrader realizes Alzheimer's disease therapy by modulating the targeted pathological membrane proteins on the damaged blood&#8208;brain barrier.








Abstract
The excessive up&#8208;regulation of receptor for advanced glycation end products (RAGE), a well&#8208;known pathological marker, drives the onset and progression of Alzheimer's disease. Although lysosome&#8208;targeting protein degradation has emerged as an effective therapeutic modality, the limited lysosome&#8208;sorting efficacy greatly hindered the degradation efficiency of target proteins. Herein, a lysosome&#8208;shuttle&#8208;like nano&#8208;chimera (endoTAC) is proposed based on polyvalent receptor binding mode for enhanced RAGE degradation as well as precise drug delivery. The endoTAC shows a high affinity to RAGE and enhances RAGE degradation due to its polyvalent&#8208;interaction with RAGE. Additionally, endoTAC features increased accumulation in diseased brain and shows promise as a precise brain delivery system. After loading with simvastatin, the SV@endoTAC proves to successfully reverse pathological features both in vitro and in vivo. The work proposes that the combination of a lysosome&#8208;targeting chimera and an effective drug delivery system can be promising in Alzheimer's disease therapy.

         <title>1D Flat Bands in Phosphorene Nanoribbons with Pentagonal Nature</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The electronic flat bands are conducive to the emergence of strongly interacting phases of matter. In this work, by reducing dimensionality into 1D, it is experimentally constructed ideal flat bands, derived from 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, in two phases of phosphorene nanoribbons with a pentagonal nature, by providing direct evidence via the ARPES measurements and atomically resolved STS mapping.








Abstract
Materials with flat bands can serve as a promising platform to investigate strongly interacting phenomena. However, experimental realization of ideal flat bands is mostly limited to artificial lattices or moir&#233; systems. Here, a general way is reported to construct 1D flat bands in phosphorene nanoribbons (PNRs) with a pentagonal nature: penta&#8208;hexa&#8208;PNRs and penta&#8208;dodeca&#8208;PNRs, wherein the corresponding 1D flat bands are directly verified by using angle&#8208;resolved photoemission spectroscopy. It is confirmed that the observed 1D flat bands originate from the electronic 1D zigzag and Lieb lattices, respectively, as revealed by the combination of bond&#8208;resolved scanning tunneling microscopy, scanning tunneling spectroscopy, tight&#8208;binding models, and first&#8208;principles calculations. The study demonstrates a general way to construct 1D flat bands in 1D solid materials system, which provides a robust platform to explore strongly interacting phases of matter.

         <title>Thermal Annealing for High Performance and Memory Behavior in n&#8208;Type Organic Electrochemical Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thermal annealing of the n&#8208;type mixed conductor has a profound effect on its crystallinity, enhancing electronic mobility and decreasing water uptake during electrochemical charging. This new microstructure imparts an &#8220;ionic memory&#8221; behavior to the material. Leveraging the polymer's sensitivity to light, this work demonstrates the first NIR light&#8208;induced conductance modulation of a mixed conductor in an aqueous electrolyte.








Abstract
N&#8208;type organic mixed ionic electronic conductors (n&#8208;OMIECs) struggle to match the performance of p&#8208;type counterparts, particularly in bioelectronics' flagship device, the organic electrochemical transistor. Enhancing n&#8208;type transistor performance typically necessitates the synthesis of new materials. More sustainable post&#8208;synthetic treatments, known to improve organic devices in dry and oxygen&#8208;free conditions, are not applied to n&#8208;OMIECs. This study introduces thermal annealing to enhance n&#8208;OMIECs' electron mobility without sacrificing their ability to take up ionic charges. Annealing increases the crystallinity of p(gNDI&#8208;gT2), the first designed n&#8208;OMIEC, enhancing its transistor performance to compete with new&#8208;generation NDI&#8208;based materials. Annealing reduces passive and in operando electrolyte uptake without compromising the device threshold voltage, keeping the device power demand low. The microstructure obtained by annealing, combined with the film's strong near&#8208;infrared (NIR) absorption and reduced water swelling, enables the creation of a device that retains photocurrent generated upon frequency&#8208;dependent light training. This leads to a microscale, water&#8208;compatible memory device that emulates the learning process of biological neurons triggered by light. This simple device can be implemented in artificial neural networks and face recognition platforms and achieve vector&#8208;matrix multiplication when fabricated in an array form, showcasing the potential for innovative applications in bioelectronics.

         <title>Single&#8208;Cell Isolation Chip Integrated with Multicolor Barcode Array for High&#8208;Throughput Single&#8208;Cell Exosome Profiling in Tissue Samples</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This work proposes a high&#8208;throughput single&#8208;cell exosome quantification and phenotyping platform using a gentle and efficient photothermal&#8208;driven chip. It achieves &#8776;97% single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency in 5 min, enabling precise exosome analysis of breast cancer cell lines and clinical tissues at the single&#8208;cell level, revealing unique exosome secretion characteristics of subgroups, and providing valuable insights for single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.








Abstract
Exosomes, functional biomarkers involved in cancer progression, have gained widespread attention for promoting tumor formation, growth, and metastasis. Current bulk exosome detections in bodily fluids enable cancer functional analysis, but average secretion levels from cell populations, losing parent cell information and ignoring exosome heterogeneity from diverse cell subgroups, necessitating an effective platform for analyzing single&#8208;cell exosome functional heterogeneity. Here, a high&#8208;throughput platform is presented, capable of efficient single&#8208;cell isolation and multi&#8208;color exosome phenotype analysis, as well as quantifying trace exosomes secreted by single cells. Photothermal&#8208;driven single&#8208;cell chips achieve significant single&#8208;cell isolation efficiency (&#8776;97%) within 5 min, facilitating the ultra&#8208;high throughput single&#8208;cell exosome analysis. By conducting mass spectrometry and protein interaction of breast cancer exosome phenotypic proteins, key exosome phenotypes are identified. Tens of thousands of single cells from breast cancer cell lines, and clinical tissues are analyzed, revealing various subgroup differences. The study finds more CD44 and EGFR co&#8208;expressing exosome subgroups in breast cancer cell lines, while immune&#8208;evasion PD&#8208;L1 high&#8208;phenotype exosome subgroups are primarily presented in complex tumor microenvironments, especially in HER2&#8208;positive tissues. This platform offers powerful single&#8208;cell isolation, exosome quantification, and phenotypic analysis capabilities, making it a powerful tool for advancing single&#8208;cell exosome analysis in cancer research.

         <title>Dimethylamine Bismuth Iodide: A Lead&#8208;Free Perovskite Enabling Ultra&#8208;Sensitive UVC Photodetection with Low Operating Voltage and High Detectivity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A stable lead&#8208;free perovskite, dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI), demonstrates exceptional UVC photodetection. The device exhibits ultralow dark current, high on/off ratio, superior detectivity, and low operating voltage. With high responsivity and external quantum efficiency, DMABI emerges as a promising candidate for high&#8208;performance, low&#8208;cost deep UV photodetectors, outperforming existing materials in key performance metrics.








Abstract
Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors (PDs) are essential for various applications, but traditional materials face challenges in cost, fabrication, and performance. This study introduces dimethylamine bismuth iodide (DMABI) as a promising lead&#8208;free perovskite for UV PDs, particularly in the UVC region. DMABI demonstrates exceptional device parameters, including an ultralow dark current of 0.12 pA at 0.05&#160;V, a high on/off ratio of 7.1 &#215; 104, and a peak detectivity of 3.18 &#215; 1013 Jones. The unique structure of DMABI, with isolated octahedral units, ensures minimal connectivity, significantly reducing dark current. When exposed to high&#8208;energy UV light, carriers gain sufficient energy to hop between octahedrally coordinated bismuth centres, resulting in substantial photocurrent. The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&#8722;1) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low&#8208;cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.

The small size of the organic cation facilitates efficient charge transfer, contributing to high responsivity (1.46 A&#160;W&lt;sup&gt;&#8722;1&lt;/sup&gt;) and external quantum efficiency (up to 717%). These results establish DMABI as a superior, low-cost candidate for UV photodetection, addressing limitations of existing materials. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms driving these characteristics and highlights potential for future advancements in UV PD technology.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Large Area Near&#8208;Field Thermophotovoltaics for Low Temperature Applications</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics promise high output power from low temperature thermal sources, but demonstrating large area devices has proven challenging. Here a novel epitaxial co&#8208;designed emitter&#8208;cell device fabricated with scalable processes demonstrates 1.2 mW from a 460&#160;&#176;C heat source, a greater than 20&#8208;fold enhancement over the far&#8208;field. Modeling of various cell changes offers a pathway to even higher power.








Abstract
Thermophotovoltaics, devices that convert thermal infrared photons to electricity, offer a key pathway for a variety of critical renewable energy technologies including thermal energy storage, waste heat recovery, and direct solar&#8208;thermal power generation. However, conventional far&#8208;field devices struggle to generate reasonable powers at lower temperatures. Near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics provide a pathway to substantially higher powers by leveraging photon tunneling effects. Here a large area near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaic device is presented, created with an epitaxial co&#8208;fabrication approach, that consists of a self&#8208;supported 0.28 cm2 emitter&#8208;cell pair with a 150&#160;nm gap. The device generates 1.22&#160;mW at 460&#160;&#176;C, a 25&#8208;fold increase over the same cell measured in a far&#8208;field configuration. Furthermore, the near&#8208;field device demonstrates short circuit current densities greater than the far&#8208;field photocurrent limit at all the temperatures tested, confirming the role of photon tunneling effects in the performance enhancement. Modeling suggests several practical directions for cell improvements and further increases in power density. These results highlight the promise of near&#8208;field thermophotovoltaics, especially for low temperature applications.

         <title>High Defect Tolerance Breaking the Design Limitation of Full&#8208;Spectrum Multimodal Luminescence Materials</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, with a high defect tolerance structure, is used to develop single&#8208;component multimodal luminescence materials. Almost all luminescent modes and full&#8208;spectrum emissions are realized by doping this single host. A series of dynamic anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices and digital information encryption technology with temporal and spatial resolution are proposed to show the visualized optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting application.








Abstract
With the development of optical anti&#8208;counterfeiting and the increasing demand for high&#8208;level information encryption, multimodal luminescence (MML) materials attract much attention. However, the discovery of these multifunctional materials is very accidental, and the versatile host suitable for developing such materials remains unclear. Here, a grossite&#8208;type fast ionic conductor CaGa4O7, characterized by layered and tunnel structure with excellent defect tolerance, is found to meet the needs of various luminescent processes. Almost all luminescent modes, including down/up&#8208;conversion luminescence (DCL/UCL), long persistent luminescence (LPL), mechanoluminescence (ML), and X&#8208;ray excited optical luminescence (XEOL), are realized in this single host. Full&#8208;spectrum (from violet to near&#8208;infrared) photoluminescence and ML as well as multicolor XEOL are achieved by simply changing the doped luminescent center. A series of anti&#8208;counterfeiting devices, including the quasi&#8208;dynamic display of famous paintings, digital information encryption, and multi&#8208;color handwritten signatures, are designed to show the encryption of information in temporal and spatial dimensions. This study clarifies the importance of defect tolerance of the host for the development of MML materials, and provides a unique insight into the cross&#8208;field applications of special functional materials, which is a new strategy to accelerate the development of novel MML materials.

         <title>Low&#8208;Temperature Lithium Metal Batteries Achieved by Synergistically Enhanced Screening Li+ Desolvation Kinetics</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
On the basis of pore sieving effect toward Li+ desolvation, the intentionally&#8208;introduced polar electron&#8208;donated chemical groups on metal&#8211;organic frameworks is developed to further boost Li+ desolvation and Li0 diffusion kinetics under low temperature, achieving uniform lithium distribution without dendrite formation. As a result, the high capacity&#8208;retention ratio of 97% is stabilized under negative/positive ratio of 3.3 and lower temperature surroundings.








Abstract
Lithium metal anode is desired by high capacity and low potential toward higher energy density than commercial graphite anode. However, the low&#8208;temperature Li metal batteries suffer from dendrite formation and dead Li resulting from uneven Li behaviors of flux with huge desolvation/diffusion barriers, thus leading to short&#160;lifespan and safety concern. Herein, differing from electrolyte engineering, a strategy of delocalizing electrons with generating rich active sites to regulate Li+ desolvation/diffusion behaviors are demonstrated via decorating polar chemical groups on porous metal&#8211;organic frameworks (MOFs). As comprehensively indicated by theoretical simulations, electrochemical analysis, in situ spectroscopies, electron microscope, and time&#8208;of&#8208;flight secondary&#8208;ion mass spectrometry, the sieving kinetics of desolvation is not merely relied on pore size morphology but also significantly affected by the &#9472;NH2 polar chemical groups,&#160;reducing energy barriers for realizing non&#8208;dendritic and smooth Li metal plating. Consequently, the optimal cells stabilize for&#160;long lifespan of 2000 h and higher average Coulombic efficiency, much better than the&#8208;state&#8208;of&#8208;art reports. Under a lower negative/positive ratio of 3.3, the full cells with NH2&#8208;MIL&#8208;125 deliver a high capacity&#8208;retention of 97.0% at 0.33 C even under &#8722;20&#160;&#176;C, showing the great potential of this kind of polar groups on boosting Li+ desolvation kinetics at room&#8208; and low&#8208;temperatures.

         <title>Ru&#8208;OV Site&#8208;Mediated Product Selectivity Switch for Overall Photocatalytic CO2 Reduction</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Achieving high selectivity in overall CO2 photoreduction is crucial for advancing carbon neutrality and sustainable energy development. This study innovatively establishes dual&#8208;functional active sites comprised of adjacent Ru single atoms and oxygen vacancies, stabilizing pivotal intermediates while enhancing local mass transport, thereby achieving the selective overall CO2 photoreduction to CH4.








Abstract
The photocatalytic reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) to methane (CH4) represents a sustainable route for directly converting greenhouse gases into chemicals but poses a significant challenge in achieving high selectivity due to thermodynamic and kinetic limitations during the reaction process. This work establishes Ru&#8208;OV active sites on the surface of TiO2 by anchoring coordination unsaturated Ru single&#8208;atoms, which stabilize crucial reaction intermediates and facilitate local mass transfer to achieve dual optimization of the thermodynamics and kinetics of the overall photocatalytic CO2 reduction. Combining operando spectroscopy with density functional theory (DFT)&#160;calculations indicates that oxygen vacancies (OV) inhibits the desorption of *CO, whereas Ru facilitates proton extraction. This configuration not only lowers the overall activation energy barrier but has also been engineered to serve as a selectivity switch, changing the reaction route to produce CH4 instead of CO. Consequently, the Ru&#8208;OV/TiO2 exhibits a 195.4&#8208;fold improvement in the CH4 yield compared to TiO2, accompanied by an increase in selectivity to 81%.

         <title>Mechanism of Hot&#8208;Carrier Photoluminescence in Sn&#8208;Based Perovskites</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>

Schematic illustrating the two dominant processes in tin&#8208;iodide perovskites at the band edge: 1) Filling of carriers at the band edge extrema as they cool. 2) Cooling of carriers emitting a longitudinal optical (LO) phonon. The inset shows the dephasing of a longitudinal optical phonon studied by impulsive vibrational spectroscopy in this work.








Abstract
Metal halide perovskites have shown exceptionally slow hot&#8208;carrier cooling, which has been attributed to various physical mechanisms without reaching a consensus. Here, experiment and theory are combined to unveil the carrier cooling process in formamidinium (FA) and caesium (Cs) tin triiodide thin films. Through impulsive vibrational spectroscopy and molecular dynamics, much shorter phonon dephasing times of the hybrid perovskite, which accounts for the larger blueshift in the photoluminescence seen at high excitation density for FASnI3 compared to CsSnI3 is reported. Density functional theory investigations reveal that the largest contribution to the blueshift is accounted by a giant, dynamic band&#8208;filling effect in Sn&#8208;based perovskites, which in turn can explain the cooling disparity with the Pb&#8208;based counterparts. Several years after the first experimental observations, here a deeper understanding of the cooling mechanism of these materials is provided. Design principles for hot&#8208;carrier materials, which may be useful for future implementations of hot&#8208;carrier solar cells are further provided.

         <title>MXene&#8208;Vitrimer Nanocomposites: Photo&#8208;Thermal Repair, Reinforcement, and Conductivity at Low Volume Fractions Through a Percolative Voronoi&#8208;Inspired Microstructure</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study unveils MXene&#8208;vitrimer nanocomposites with a distinct biphasic Voronoi&#8208;inspired microstructure, where a percolative MXene minor&#8208;phase spans throughout a vitrimer major&#8208;phase. Fabricated via a streamlined three&#8208;step process of precipitation polymerization, MXene aqueous coating, and melt&#8208;pressing, these nanocomposites deliver photo&#8208;thermal repairability, mechanical reinforcement, and conductivity at low loadings, achieving greatly diminished percolation thresholds and multifunctionality for advanced smart materials and sustainable composites.








Abstract
An innovative process to multifunctional vitrimer nanocomposites with a percolative MXene minor phase is reported, marking a significant advancement in creating stimuli&#8208;repairable, reinforced, sustainable, and conductive nanocomposites at diminished loadings. This achievement arises from a Voronoi&#8208;inspired biphasic morphological design via a straight&#8208;forward three&#8208;step process involving ambient&#8208;condition precipitation polymerization of micron&#8208;sized prepolymer powders, aqueous powder&#8208;coating with 2D MXene (Ti3C2Tz), and melt&#8208;pressing of MXene&#8208;coated powders into crosslinked films. Due to the formation of MXene&#8208;rich boundaries between thiourethane vitrimer domains in a pervasive low&#8208;volume fraction conductive network, a low percolation threshold (&#8776;0.19&#160;vol.%) and conductive polymeric nanocomposites (&#8776;350 S&#160;m&#8722;1) are achieved. The embedded MXene skeleton mechanically bolsters the vitrimer at intermediate loadings, enhancing the modulus and toughness by 300% and 50%, respectively, without mechanical detriment compared to the neat vitrimer. The vitrimer's dynamic&#8208;covalent bonds and MXene's photo&#8208;thermal conversion properties enable repair in minutes through short&#8208;term thermal treatments for full macroscopic mechanical restoration or in seconds under 785&#160;nm light for rapid localized surface repair. This versatile fabrication method to nanocoated pre&#8208;vitrimer powders and morphologically complex nanocomposites is compatible with classic composite manufacturing, and when coupled with the material's exceptional properties, holds immense potential for revolutionizing advanced composites and inspiring next&#8208;generation smart materials.

         <title>Spatiotemporal Nano&#8208;Regulator Unleashes Anti&#8208;Tumor Immunity by Overcoming Dendritic Cell Tolerance and T Cell Exhaustion in Tumor&#8208;Draining Lymph Nodes</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study introduces a novel nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) engineered to reprogram dendritic cells (DCs) within tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs), significantly enhancing anti&#8208;tumor immunity. The DNR employs a dual TLR activation strategy, simultaneously mitigating immune checkpoint suppression. This targeted approach directly addresses DC tolerance and T cell exhaustion, effectively restoring robust anti&#8208;tumor responses.








Abstract
Lymph nodes are crucial immune foci as the primary target for cancer immunotherapy. However, the anti&#8208;tumor functions of tumor&#8208;draining lymph nodes (TDLNs) are critically suppressed by tumors. Here, a novel spatiotemporal nano&#8208;regulator is presented, designed to modulate the dendritic cells (DCs) in TDLNs, establishing a supportive niche for immune surveillance. The DC&#8208;mediated nano&#8208;regulator (DNR) is established by the self&#8208;assembly of an imidazoquinoline (IMDQ) prodrug, inhibitory immune checkpoint (ICP) siRNA, and mannan (a TLR4 agonist). This unique design leverages the spatiotemporal activation of TLR4 and TLR7/8, thereby optimizing DC maturation and cytokine production. This further promotes efficient T cell priming. Simultaneously, the ICP&#8208;targeting siRNA mitigates the tolerogenic effects induced by tumor&#8208;derived factors and TLR activation, preventing T cell exhaustion. In essence, DNR facilitates potent remodeling of TDLNs and the tumor microenvironment, activating the anti&#8208;tumor immunity cascade. When combined with vaccines, DNR greatly promotes tumor regression and the establishment of long&#8208;term immunological memory.

         <title>High&#8208;Efficiency Gold Nanoaggregates for NIR LED&#8208;Driven Sustained Mild Photothermal Therapy Achieving Complete Tumor Eradication and Immune Enhancement</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is presented, utilizing gold nanoparticle aggregates (AuNAs) with an impressive photothermal efficiency of up to 92.8%. This strategy employs low&#8208;power LED irradiation to achieve complete tumor eradication while enhancing safety and immune responses. The findings indicate that this approach has significant potential for improving cancer treatment outcomes and expanding the applicability of photothermal therapy.








Abstract
For millennia, humans have harnessed thermal energy to treat cancer. However, delivering energy to tumor tissues in traditional hyperthermia remains a significant challenge. Nanotechnology has revolutionized this approach, enabling nanomaterials to target tumors precisely and act as internal heat sources. Nanomaterial&#8208;based photothermal therapy employs nano&#8208;photothermal agents to absorb near&#8208;infrared light and convert it into heat, offering non&#8208;invasive, highly controllable, and specific treatment for solid tumors. Nonetheless, achieving complete tumor eradication, preventing recurrence, and ensuring safety continue to be major concerns. To address these issues, sustained mild photothermal therapy (smPTT) is proposed, utilizing gold nanoaggregates (AuNAs) with a high photothermal conversion efficiency (92.8%) in combination with a single irradiation of low&#8208;power (&#8764;0.1 W&#160;cm&#8722;2) sustained LED light. This method achieved complete tumor eradication in animal models, with no recurrence over long&#8208;term (&gt;180 days) monitoring. This strategy provides superior therapeutic effects compared to mild photothermal therapy and higher safety than high&#8208;temperature photothermal therapy. Additionally, it induces a strong immune response and immune memory, crucial for preventing tumor recurrence and metastasis. This novel approach to photothermal therapy may significantly impact clinical applications for shallow tumor treatment and offer new avenues for immunotherapy.

         <title>Suspending Light&#8208;Absorbing Nanoparticles in Silica Aerogel Enables Numerous Superblacks</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Numerous superblacks are fabricated via generally suspending individual light&#8208;absorbing nanoparticles in man&#8208;made solid smoke.








Abstract

         <title>Living Porous Ceramics for Bacteria&#8208;Regulated Gas Sensing and Carbon Capture</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Porous ceramics colonized by bacteria can achieve self&#8208;regulated, programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functions. The porosity of the ceramic scaffold enables autonomous nutrient transport through capillary forces, enabling microbial growth without external energy. Using wild&#8208;type cyanobacteria and engineered&#160;E. coli, living porous ceramics are created to capture CO2 directly from the air and convert toxic gases into human&#8208;detectable benign scents.








Abstract
Microorganisms hosted in abiotic structures have led to engineered living materials that can grow, sense, and adapt in ways that mimic biological systems. Although porous structures should favor colonization by microorganisms, they have not yet been exploited as abiotic scaffolds for the development of living materials. Here, porous ceramics are reported that are colonized by bacteria to form an engineered living material with self&#8208;regulated and genetically programmable carbon capture and gas&#8208;sensing functionalities. The carbon capture capability is achieved using wild&#8208;type photosynthetic cyanobacteria, whereas the gas&#8208;sensing function is generated utilizing genetically engineered E. coli. Hierarchical porous clay is used as a ceramic scaffold and evaluated in terms of bacterial growth, water uptake, and mechanical properties. Using state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art chemical analysis techniques, the ability of the living porous ceramics are demonstrated to capture CO2 directly from the air and to metabolically turn minute amounts of toxic gas into a benign scent detectable by humans.

         <title>Synergistic Acid&#8208;Base Action Leads to Ultrafast Decontamination of Nerve and Blister Agents by OH&#8722; Intercalated Zr4+&#8208;Doped MgAl&#8208;LDH under Ambient Conditions</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The synthesized Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH achieves ultrafast decontamination of nerve and blister agents under ambient conditions with the synergistic effect of Zr4+ and bridging/terminal hydroxyl in the laminates and OH&#8722; in the interlayers, remarkably sets the record for the shortest decontamination half&#8208;life for DECP and GD. Further, self&#8208;detoxifying protective fibers are prepared using Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH as a catalytic component.








Abstract
Developing materials capable of rapidly decontaminating nerve and blister agents directly under ambient conditions are crucial for practical applications. In this work, Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH with different Zr4+ doping contents and corresponding OH&#8722; intercalated materials Mg3Al1&#8208;xZrx&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH are synthesized. First, they are used for the decontamination of nerve agents under ambient conditions, showing that increasing the Zr4+ doping amount accelerates the decontamination rate of diethyl cyanophosphonate (DECP) and soman (GD), with the half&#8208;life of DECP and GD being 3&#8211;5 times shorter with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH (the highest Zr4+ doping content) compared to Mg3Al1&#8208;LDH. Notably, the intercalation of OH&#8722; in Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH further greatly enhances the catalytic activity for DECP and GD, the reaction half&#8208;life of DECP and GD with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH being 18&#160;s and &lt;15&#160;s, respectively, which is the shortest recorded so far. Additionally, under ambient conditions, Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH exhibits superior detoxification performance for mustard gas (HD) compared to Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH, with 92.8% of HD being removed within 6&#160;h. Mechanistic studies reveal that Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH efficiently decontaminates nerve and blister agents utilizing the synergistic effect of Lewis acid&#8208;base sites (Zr4+ and laminate OH groups) and interlayer OH&#8722;. To extend the practical applications of the materials, PVA@(PAN/LDH&#8208;OH) self&#8208;detoxifying fiber loaded with Mg3Al0.6Zr0.4&#8208;LDH&#8208;OH is prepared.

         <title>Enhance Photo&#8208;Stability of Up&#8208;Scalable Organic Solar Cells: Suppressing Radical Generation in Polymer Donors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Organic solar cells with a wide thickness range fabricated by doctor&#8208;blade with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in air show strong losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress. Suppressing radical generation in polymer donors processed in air by increasing the crystallinity in unit thickness is critical for enhancing photo&#8208;stability of up&#8208;scalable organic solar cells.








Abstract
The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of single&#8208;junction organic solar cells (OSCs) has been promoted above 20%. Device up&#8208;scaling draws more and more research attentions. Besides the high PCE for devices with up&#8208;scalable fabrication methods and conditions, achieving high stability simultaneously is essential for pushing industrialization of this technology. Here, the stability of the state&#8208;of&#8208;the&#8208;art OSCs blade&#8208;coated in air with non&#8208;halogenated solvents in a wide thickness range is thoroughly investigated. The losses in short&#8208;circuit current density under photo&#8208;thermal stress strongly depend on processing conditions. Devices with less crystalline phases in unit thickness show faster generation of trap states and hence strongly reduced charge collection efficiency. Through in&#8208;depth photo&#8208;chemical, photo&#8208;physical, and morphological characterizations during ageing, faster generation of radicals in PM6 for active layers with more amorphous structures is identified as the cause for device degradation. Increasing the crystallinity of active layer films for suppressing radical generation in polymer donors is critical to enhance the photo&#8208;thermal stability of devices processed in air with a wide thickness range.

This work describes a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds.








Abstract
Chronic wounds impose significant physical and mental burdens on patients. Nano&#8208;based formulations offer a promising strategy for chronic wound healing due to their non&#8208;invasive nature and enhanced biofilms penetration, but they often lack targeting capability or fail to achieve long&#8208;term and synergistic effects. In this work, a multifunctional microneedle (MN) patch loaded with engineered nitric oxide (NO)&#8208;releasing nanocarriers are presented that encapsulate an antibacterial agent and are immobilized with Concanavalin A (Con A) and NO molecules for targeted and synergistic treatment of chronic wounds. With the assistance of MNs, the nanoparticles (NPs) can directly cross bacterial biofilms and be efficiently delivered to wound tissues, where they target harmful bacteria through the specific recognition between Con A and polysaccharides on bacterial surfaces, followed by the release of the encapsulated antimicrobial agent, thereby achieving effective antibacterial effect. Moreover, the NPs generate NO in a sustained manner as they dissociate in the wound tissue, which exerts potent anti&#8208;inflammatory action and benefits tissue regeneration, further promoting chronic wounds closure. Consequently, this work provides a novel MN patch loaded with engineered NPs designed for accelerating chronic wound healing through targeted and synergistic therapy.

         <title>Thiol Carbazole Self&#8208;Assembled Monolayers as Tunable Carrier Injecting Interlayers for Organic Transistors and Complementary Circuits</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thiol&#8208;based carbazole self&#8208;assembled monolayers are synthesized and used to tune the work function of gold electrodes from 4.52 to 5.48 eV, making them suitable for application as hole or electron injecting contacts in organic thin&#8208;film transistors. Using these thiol&#8208;based monolayers, p/n&#8208;channel organic transistors and complementary inverters are demonstrated.








Abstract
The significant contact resistance at the metal&#8208;semiconductor interface is a well&#8208;documented issue for organic thin&#8208;film transistors (OTFTs) that hinders device and circuit performance. Here, this issue is tackled by developing three new thiol carbazole&#8208;based self&#8208;assembled monolayer (SAM) molecules, namely tBu&#8208;2SCz, 2SCz, and Br&#8208;2SCz, and utilizing them as carrier&#8208;selective injection interlayers. The SAMs alter the work function of gold electrodes by more than 1 eV, making them suitable for use in hole and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs. Scanning tunneling microscopy analysis indicates that 2SCz and Br&#8208;2SCz form highly ordered molecular rows, resulting in work function values of 4.86 and 5.48 eV, respectively. The latter value is higher than gold electrodes modified by the commonly used pentafluorobenzenethiol (&#8776;5.33 eV), making Br&#8208;2SCz promising for hole injection. Conversely, tBu&#8208;2SCz appears disordered with a lower work function of 4.52 eV, making it more suitable for electron injection. These intriguing properties are leveraged to demonstrate hole&#8208; and electron&#8208;transporting OTFTs with improved operating characteristics. All&#8208;organic complementary inverters are finally demonstrated by integrating p&#8208; and n&#8208;channel OTFTs, showcasing the potential of this simple yet powerful contact work function engineering approach. The present study highlights the versatility of thiol carbazole SAMs as carrier injecting interlayers for OTFTs and integrated circuits.

         <title>Size&#8208;Dependent Multiexciton Dynamics Governs Scintillation From Perovskite Quantum Dots</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Quantum&#8208;confined nano scintillators are gaining interest in radiation detection. Understanding the nanoscale scintillation mechanism and key material parameters is crucial. These open questions are addressed by studying the scintillation of CsPbBr3 quantum dots. Increasing the particle size increases the energy deposition, the (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and the emission yield, resulting in maximized scintillation efficiency and timing. A validated theoretical model for the scintillation yield and kinetics is developed, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.








Abstract
The recent emergence of quantum&#8208;confined nanomaterials in the field of radiation detection, in particular lead halide perovskite nanocrystals, offers scalability and performance advantages over conventional materials. This development raises fundamental questions about the mechanism of scintillation itself at the nanoscale and the role of particle size, arguably the most defining parameter of quantum dots. Understanding this is crucial for the design and optimization of future nanotechnology scintillators. In this work, these open questions are addressed by theoretically and experimentally studying the size&#8208;dependent scintillation of CsPbBr3 nanocrystals using a combination of Monte Carlo simulations, spectroscopic, and radiometric techniques. The results show that the simultaneous effects of size&#8208;dependent energy deposition, (multi&#8208;)exciton population, and light emission under ionizing excitation, typical of confined particles, combine to maximize the scintillation efficiency and time performance of larger nanocrystals due to greater stopping power and reduced Auger decay. The agreement between theory and experiment produces a fully validated descriptive model that predicts the scintillation yield and kinetics of nanocrystals without free parameters, providing fundamental guidance for the rational design of nanoscale scintillators.

         <title>A Mitochondrion&#8208;Targeting Piezoelectric Nanosystem for the Treatment of Erectile Dysfunction via Autophagy Regulation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Here, the study proposes a mitochondrion&#8208;targeted piezoelectric nanosystem that can promote mitophagy and ameliorate hyperglycemia in diabetic mice through ultrasound&#8208;assisted electric current generation and long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) release, respectively. The findings reveal that this nanosystem can be employed for the treatment of erectile dysfunction.








Abstract
Mitochondrial damage caused by external stimuli, such as high glucose levels and inflammation, results in excessive reactive oxygen species (ROS) production. Existing antioxidants can only scavenge ROS and cannot address the root cause of ROS production, namely, abnormal mitochondria. To overcome this limitation, the study develops a piezoelectric synergistic drug&#8208;loaded nanosystem (BaTCG nanosystem) that targets mitochondria. The BaTCG nanosystem is delivered to mitochondria via triphenylphosphine modification, and generates current under the stimulation of ultrasound, thereby promoting mitochondrial autophagy and restoring mitochondrial&#160; homeostasis. In a model of diabetes&#8208;related erectile dysfunction (ED), the BaTCG nanosystem, through the current induced by the piezoelectric effect, not only promoted mitophagy, thereby reducing ROS production, but also released long&#8208;acting glucagon&#8208;like peptide&#8208;1 receptor agonists (GLP&#8208;1RAs) to effectively reduce blood glucose levels and mitochondrial damage. Each component of this nanosystem functions individually as well as synergistically, thus facilitating corpus cavernosum repair and restoring erectile function. In conclusion, the findings offer a novel therapeutic strategy for diabetes&#8208;related ED and a target for the treatment of diabetes&#8208;related conditions with functionalized nanoparticles to regulate mitophagy.

         <title>Functionalized Nanozyme Microcapsules Targeting Deafness Prevention via Mitochondrial Homeostasis Remodeling</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Functionalized nanozyme microcapsules are established to protect cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss via mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed microcapsules reprogram the energy supply mechanism and inhibit the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c.








Abstract
Mitochondrial dysfunction, which is the primary mechanism underlying cisplatin&#8208;induced hearing loss, can potentially be mitigated by modulating the redox balance and reprogramming the energy metabolism to remodel mitochondrial homeostasis. Herein, N&#8208;acetyl&#8208;l&#8208;cysteine&#8211;derived carbonized polymer dots (NAC CPDs) are embedded into manganese porphyrin&#8211;doped metal&#8211;organic frameworks and encapsulated using a polydopamine (PDA) coating and gelatin methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel to afford functionalized nanozyme microcapsules. Owing to their injectability and adhesion properties, these microcapsules exhibit the advantages of prolonged retention in the middle ear and sustained release in the inner ear. The synergy between the manganese porphyrin and polymer dots results in excellent antioxidant properties. The developed nanozymes activate the PI3K&#8208;AKT pathway, reprogramming the energy supply mechanism, and inhibiting the oligomerization of BAX in mitochondria to prevent the leakage of mitochondrial DNA and cytochrome c. Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.

Therapeutic efficacy and related mechanisms are validated in vivo. Thus, this study on mitochondrial homeostasis remodeling by nanozyme microcapsules opens a new chapter in the treatment of hearing loss.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded>

         <title>Xolography for 3D Printing in Microgravity</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Xolography can 3D print versatile plastic and hydrogel parts in microgravity and a variety of resins can be processed independent from viscosity and flow properties. Just like on Earth, complex geometries, smooth surfaces and feature resolution down to 20&#160;&#181;m can be achieved during 20&#160;s microgravity phases in a parabolic flight experiment.








Abstract
Xolography is a volumetric 3D printing technique utilizing intersecting light beams within a volume of photopolymer for a spatially controlled photopolymerization. Unlike layer&#8208;based methods, Xolography creates structures continuously within a closed photopolymer vat, eliminating the prevalent need for support structures and allowing full geometrical freedom at high printing speeds. The volumetric working principle does not rely on gravity, making Xolography an outstanding technology for additive manufacturing under microgravity conditions as illustrated in a set of experiments during a parabolic flight campaign. The microgravity environment obviates the need for rheology control of resins, enabling the use of low&#8208;viscosity formulations (e.g., 11&#160;mPa&#160;s) while maintaining the fast and precise 3D printing of acrylic polymer resins and hydrogels. Xolography's speed and reliability facilitate rapid iterations of a print task between Earth's gravity and microgravity conditions. This capability positions Xolography as an ideal tool for material research and manufacturing in space, offering significant cost and efficiency advantages over traditional methods.

         <title>Self&#8208;Selective (220) Directional Grown Copper Current Collector Design for Cycling&#8208;Stable Anode&#8208;Less Lithium Metal Batteries</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A self&#8208;selective, preferentially Li salt&#8208;adsorbing and inorganic interphase&#8208;catalyzing copper current collector (CuCC) design is developed by incorporating Li salt into CuCC fabrication process to self&#8208;select out its salt&#8208;philic facet growth. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet&#8208;dominant CuCC exhibits high selectivity and catalyzation ability for Li salt adsorption, decomposition, and inorganic interphase formation over other facets, reducing the electrode degradation speed by 33&#8211;42%.









Abstract
Anode&#8208;less lithium metal batteries (ALLMB) are promising candidates for energy storage applications owing to high&#8208;energy&#8208;density and safety characteristics. However, the unstable solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) formed on anode copper current collector (CuCC) leads to poor reversibility of uneven lithium deposition/stripping. Though the well&#8208;known knowledge of lithium salt&#8208;derived inorganic&#8208;rich SEI (iSEI) benefiting uniform lithium deposition, how to design a lithium salt&#8208;philic CuCC with undiscovered salt&#8208;philic facet that favors lithium salt adsorption and catalyzing salt decomposition into iSEI, remains unexplored yet. Here, a self&#8208;selective and iSEI&#8208;catalyzing CuCC design is developed by using lithium salt as surface&#8208;controlling agent in CuCC electrodeposition process, self&#8208;selecting out and guiding unidirectional Cu(220) facet growth as the most salt&#8208;philic facets of CuCC. This self&#8208;selected Cu(220) facet promotes the salt adsorption and formation of salt decomposition&#8208;derived iSEI in battery, thus improving the lithium plating/stripping coulombic efficiency from 99.25% to 99.50% (stable within 400 cycles), and the capacity decay rate of ALLMB is also reduced by 42.4% within 100 cycles. Practical mass&#8208;productivity of this self&#8208;selective CuCC for 350 Wh kg&#8722;1 pouch&#8208;cell fabrication is also demonstrated, providing a new self&#8208;selective current collector design strategy for improving selectivity and catalyzation of desired chemical reaction, important for high&#8208;selectivity electrochemical reaction system construction.

         <title>High&#8208;Temperature Diffusion Enabled Epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O System</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Thin&#8208;film epitaxy of the Ti&#8211;O system at ultra&#8208;high temperatures realizes an unconventional growth mode. Above 1000&#160;&#176;C, oxygen diffusion from the substrates governs the growth dynamics and the resulting growth phase diagram appears to be against basic thermodynamics. The growth temperature selectively stabilizes the oxidation state of the Ti&#8211;O system, which demonstrates a novel self&#8208;regulated growth of epitaxial oxides.








Abstract
High temperatures promote kinetic processes that can drive crystal synthesis toward ideal thermodynamic conditions, thereby realizing samples of superior quality. While accessing very high temperatures in thin&#8208;film epitaxy is becoming increasingly accessible through laser&#8208;based heating methods, demonstrations of such utility are still emerging. The study realizes a novel self&#8208;regulated growth mode in the Ti&#8211;O system by relying on thermally activated diffusion of oxygen from an oxide substrate. The controlled diffusion enables oxidation state selectivity of single&#8208;phase films with superior crystallinity to conventional approaches as evidenced by structural and electronic measurements. The diffusion&#8208;enabled epitaxy is potentially of wide use in the growth of transition metal oxides, opening up new opportunities for ultra&#8208;high purity epitaxial platforms based on d&#8208;orbital&#160;systems.

Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) nanoparticles (NPs) are supported in nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon farmwork and demonstrated as an efficient catalyst for electrochemical nitrate reduction in ammonia synthesis.

Abstract
The electrochemical nitrate reduction reaction (NO3
&#8722;RR) for ammonia (NH3) synthesis represents a significant technological advancement, yet it involves a cascade of elementary reactions alongside various intermediates. Thus, the development of multi&#8208;site catalysts for enhancing NO3
&#8722;RR and understanding the associated reaction mechanisms for NH3 synthesis is vital. Herein, a versatile approach is presented to construct platinum based high&#8208;entropy intermetallic (HEI) library for NH3 synthesis. The HEI nanoparticles (NPs) are uniformly supported on a 2D nitrogen doped mesoporous carbon (N&#8208;mC) framework, featured with adjustable compositions (up to eight elements) and a high degree of atomic order (over 90%). Guided by the density functional theory (DFT) calculations and atomic structural analysis, a quinary Pt0.8Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2Cu0.2 HEI NPs based N&#8208;mC catalyst is designed, which demonstrates a large ammonia Faradaic efffciency (&gt;97%) and a remarkable recyclability (&gt;20 cycles) under both acidic and basic conditions. The combined in situ experimental analysis and further DFT calculation suggests that the well&#8208;defined multi&#8208;sites nature of the HEI NPs cooperate for a tandem reduction mechanism, in which the Pt&#8208;X (X represents the other four transition elements) bridging sites offer optimal adsorption for key nitrogen&#8211;oxygen species while the Pt sites facilitate the generation and adsorption of *H species.

         <title>Polyphenol Mediated Assembly: Tailored Nano&#8208;Dredger Unblocks Axonal Autophagosomes Retrograde Transport Traffic Jam for Accelerated Alzheimer's Waste Clearance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>

Customized Nano&#8208;dredger based on the complex interaction between polyphenol Lithospermic acid B (LA) and various substances, including siRNA, lipid nanovacuoles (LIP), &#949;&#8208;polylysine (&#949;PLL), achieves efficient brain&#8208;neuron targeting, enhances the operability and patency of axonal autophagosome retrograde transport and autolysosomal fusion&#8208;degradation process, thereby decreasing Alzheimer's disease (AD)&#8208;related neuronal waste burden (aberrant accumulated protein/aging organelle) and achieving neuroprotection.








Abstract
Clear&#8208;cut evidence has linked defective autophagy to Alzheimer's disease (AD). Recent studies underscore a unique hurdle in AD neuronal autophagy: impaired retrograde axonal transport of autophagosomes, potent enough to induce autophagic stress and neurodegeneration. Nonetheless, pertinent therapy is unavailable. Here, a novel combinational therapy composed of siROCK2 and lithospermic acid B (LA) is introduced, tailored to dredge blocked axonal autophagy by multi&#8208;mitigating microtubule disruption, ATP depletion, oxidative stress, and autophagy initiation impediments in AD. Leveraging the recent discovery of multi&#8208;interactions between polyphenol LA and siRNA, &#949;&#8208;Poly&#8208;L&#8208;lysine, and anionic lipid nanovacuoles, LA and siROCK2 are successfully co&#8208;loaded into a fresh nano&#8208;drug delivery system, LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC, via a ratio&#8208;flexible and straightforward fabrication process. Further modification with the TPL peptide onto LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC creates a brain&#8208;neuron targeted, biocompatible, and pluripotent nanomedicine, named &#8220;Nano&#8208;dredger&#8221; (T&#8208;LIP@PL&#8208;LA/siRC). Nano&#8208;dredger efficiently accelerates axonal retrograde transport and lysosomal degradation of autophagosomes, thereby facilitating the clearance of neurotoxic proteins, improving neuronal complexity, and alleviating memory defects in 3&#215;Tg&#8208;AD transgenic mice. This study provides a fresh and flexible polyphenol/siRNA co&#8208;delivery paradigm and furnishes conceptual proof that dredging axonal autophagy represents a promising AD therapeutic avenue.

         <title>Reviving Zn Dendrites to Electroactive Zn2+ by Ion Sieve Interface</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2&#8314; diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, conventional Zn0 dendrite growth suppression strategies are shifted by introducing proactive dendrite&#8208;digesting chemistry via an ion sieve interface. This work provides unique insights into achieving reversible aqueous Zn metal batteries.








Abstract
Zn0 dendrite formation during repeated plating/stripping processes limits the practical use of Zn&#8208;metal anodes in reliable and affordable energy storage. Traditional methods, including dendrite suppression and dendrite regulation, fail under demanding performance conditions due to Zn2+ diffusion limitations and concentration gradients. Here, using an in situ pre&#8208;zincation approach, a Li2ZnxTi3&#8208;xO8 (LZTO, 0&lt;x&lt;3) layer with uniform ion channels is introduced. This layer acts as an ionic sieve, reviving Zn0 dendrite into Zn2+ through redox reactions and enhancing Zn2+ diffusion kinetics. Experiment and simulation results reveal that Zn2+ migrates along the (111) crystal plane of LZTO through the successive replacement of Zn atoms in tetrahedral positions, with a high transference number of 0.796. LZTO@Zn performs better in coin cells at high currents (e.g., 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2) and operates at higher Zn utilization (300&#160;h at 56.98%&#160;Zn utilization), with four times the lifespan at &#8722;40&#160;&#176;C and six times longer in alkaline electrolytes compared to bare Zn. Pouch cells with LZTO@Zn anodes operate in a low N/P ratio (6.9) and lean electrolyte (E/C is 20&#160;&#181;L mA h&#8722;1), achieving enhanced cycling stability. The findings indicate the significance of ion sieves with ordered ion channels in mitigating Zn0 dendrites and promoting rapid Zn2+ transport.

         <title>Inverse Size&#8208;Scaling Ferroelectricity in Centrosymmetric Insulating Perovskite Oxide DyScO3</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In centrosymmetric DyScO3, nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;polar transition is observed by atomically&#8208;resolved electron microscopy. Driven by surface charge transfer, the asymmetric Dy&#8208;Dy split and ferrodistortive octahedral order break the inversion symmetry. The inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectricity, prevailing in many perovskites with alternatively charged AOn+ and BO2n&#8722; (n &#8800; 0) layers, opens up a new era for novel ferroelectric study at low dimension.








Abstract
The breaking of inversion symmetry dictates the emergence of electric polarization, whose topological states in superlattices and bulks have received tremendous attention for their intriguing physics brought for novel device design. However, as for substrate oxides such as LaAlO3, KTaO3, RScO3 (R = rare earth element), their centrosymmetric trivial attributes make their functionality poorly explored. Here, the discovery of nanoscale thickness gradient&#8208;induced nonpolar&#8208;to&#8208;polar phase transition in band insulator DyScO3 is reported by using atomic resolution transmission electron microscopy. As the free&#8208;standing specimen reduces to a critical thickness &#8776;5 nm, its inversion symmetry is spontaneously broken by surface charge transfer, which gives rise to asymmetric Dy atomic displacements and ferrodistortive octahedral order, as substantiated by the first&#8208;principles calculations. Apart from the observation of migratable polar vortex structures, the switchable electric polarization by applied electric field is demonstrated by the piezoresponse force microscopy experiments. Given the decisive role of critical size in generating ferroelectricity, a concept of &#8220;inverse size&#8208;scaling ferroelectric&#8221; is proposed to define a class of such materials. Distinct from the proper and improper ferroelectrics, the findings offer a new platform to explore novel low&#8208;dimensional ferroelectrics and device applications in the future.

         <title>Ultra&#8208;Antifouling Liquid&#8208;Like Surfaces for Sustainable Viscous Water&#8208;in&#8208;Oil Emulsions Separation and Oil Recovery</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel slippery surface is introduced for the enduring separation of viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsions through the meticulous construction of a robust, chemically cross&#8208;linked network embedding soft nanomicelles, complemented by the integration of the corrosion&#8208;resistant polystyrene. Ultimately, the coating exhibits outstanding anti&#8208;oil&#8208;adhesion properties (even viscous crude oil), and chemical and mechanical stability, preventing membrane fouling and enabling efficient sustainable high&#8208;viscosity emulsion separation.









Abstract
The demand for efficient separation techniques in industries dealing with high viscosity emulsions has surged due to their widespread applications in various scenarios, including emulsion&#8208;based drug delivery systems, the removal of emulsified impurities in formulations and oil spill remediation. However, membrane fouling is a major challenge for conventional separation methods, leading to decreased efficiency and increased maintenance costs. Herein, a novel approach is reported by constructing liquid&#8208;like surfaces with double anti&#8208;fouling structure, incorporating soft nanomicelles within a rigid, chemically cross&#8208;linked network for both anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling and effective viscous water&#8208;in&#8208;oil emulsion separation. The coating significantly outperforms perfluorinated and commercial polytetrafluoroethylene (PVDF) membranes, effectively preventing the adhesion of viscous oils like crude oil and pump oil, and alleviating severe membrane fouling. For high&#8208;viscosity emulsions (97.3 cP and 52.8 cP), it maintains over 99% separation efficiency after 3&#160;h continuous use. Even after 15&#160;h immersion in strong acids, alkalis, salts, or organic solvents, its separation efficiency remains above 95%. In addition, thanks to the anti&#8208;membrane&#8208;fouling ability, this work achieved 6&#160;h continuous emulsion separation performance for the first time, demonstrating unparalleled long&#8208;term stability. Overall, this study offers valuable insights into the development of innovative coatings for efficient and eco&#8208;friendly separation of high&#8208;viscosity emulsions.

         <title>Sign&#8208;Switchable Poisson's Ratio Design for Bimodal Strain&#8208;to&#8208;Electrical Signal Transducing Device</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An effective and universal strategy for constructing hybrid materials with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio is developed, enabling the material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. Upon integrating a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film onto its surface, the device can switch its strain&#8208;resistance response between strain&#8208;insensitive and strain&#8208;dependent states due to the varying deformation characteristics.








Abstract
Stretchable electronic devices that conduct strain&#8208;related electronic performances have drawn extensive attention, functioning as mechanical sensors, actuators, and stretchable conductors. Although strain&#8208;insensitive or strain&#8208;responsive nature is well&#8208;achieved separately, it remains challenging to combine these two characteristics in one single device, which will offer versatile adaptability in various working situations. Herein, a hybrid material with sign&#8208;switchable Poisson's ratio (SSPR) is developed by combining a phase&#8208;change gel based reentrantreentrant honeycomb pattern and a polydimethylsiloxane film. The phase&#8208;change gel featuring thermally&#8208;regulated Young's modulus enables the hybrid material to switch between negative and positive Poisson's ratios. After integrating with a pre&#8208;stretched silver nanowires film, the obtained stretchable device performs bimodal strain&#8208;to&#8208;electrical signal transducing (Bi&#8208;SET) functions, in which the SSPR&#8208;dominated strain&#8208;resistance response switches between strain&#8208;dependent and strain&#8208;insensitive behaviors. As a proof of concept, a mode&#8208;switchable grasping system is constructed using a Bi&#8208;SET device&#8208;based controller, enabling the adaptation of grasping behaviors to various target objects.

         <title>Optically Pumped and Electrically Switchable Microlaser Array Based on Elliptic Deformation and Q&#8208;Attenuation of Organic Droplet Oscillators</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optically pumped and electrically Q&#8208;switchable minute laser oscillators are invented. The oscillator is made from a robust self&#8208;standing organic droplet that deforms into a prolate spheroid under an electric field. The deformation induces the attenuation of the quality factor, leading to a halt of the laser emission. An array of droplet lasers is also demonstrated as a prototype laser display.








Abstract
Conventional laser panel displays are developed through the mass integration of electrically pumped lasers or through the incorporation of a beam steering system with an array of optically pumped lasers. Here a novel configuration of a laser panel display consisting of a non&#8208;steered pumping beam and an array of electrically Q&#8208;switchable lasers is reported. The laser oscillator consists of a robust, self&#8208;standing, and deformable minute droplet that emits laser through Whispering&#8208;Gallery Mode resonance when optically pumped. The laser oscillation is electrically switchable during optical pumping by applying a vertical electric field to the droplet. Electromagnetic and fluid dynamics simulations reveal the deformation of the droplet into a prolate spheroid under the electric field and associated attenuation of quality factor (Q&#8208;factor), leading to the halt of the laser oscillation. A 2 &#215; 3 array of droplets is fabricated by inkjet printing as a prototype of a laser panel display, and it successfully achieves the pixel&#8208;selective switching of the oscillation.

         <title>A New Generation of Multimilliwatt&#8208;Class Colloidal Quantum&#8208;Dot Lasers at Full Colors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The full&#8208;color QD lasers relevant for practical implementations are achieved. These QD lasers feature the simultaneous metrics of low threshold, long operating duration, and multimilliwatt output power under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping. To the best of the available knowledge, the multimilliwatt output power has never been realized in QD lasers before. These results open the door to practical QD lasers.








Abstract
Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are attractive gain materials owing to the wide range of accessible colors. However, the existing QD lasers struggle to combine technologically relevant metrics of low threshold and long operating duration with considerable output powers. Here a new class of full&#8208;color QD lasers are reported, featuring low threshold, uninterrupted operation for dozens of hours, and multimilliwatt output under quasi&#8208;steady&#8208;state pumping, by coupling the high&#8208;gain QDs with a double&#8208;clad pumping scheme. Corroborated by the comprehensive transient spectroscopy and numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the ternary QDs with specially designed fine nanostructure enable the low gain threshold, giant gain coefficient, long gain lifetime, and excellent resistance against intense photoexcitation. Meanwhile, the double&#8208;clad QD&#8208;fiber design allows for record&#8208;long light&#8208;gain interaction, high conversion efficiency, and sustained device operation. As such, the QD lasers with multimilliwatt output powers, unobserved in QD lasers to date, have been realized. Further, the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept application for generating vortex beams with various topological charges is demonstrated. This work represents significant progress toward practical lasers based on QDs.

         <title>Efficient Gate&#8208;Tunable Hot&#8208;Carrier Photocurrent from Perovskite Multiple Quantum Wells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Hot carrier devices with low&#8208;dimensional semiconductor heterostructures are promising for enhancing photon&#8208;to&#8208;current conversion beyond the Shockley&#8208;Queisser limit. This study presents a 2D Van der Waals heterostructure device made of 2D perovskite quantum wells and few&#8208;layer MoS&#8322;. The device shows efficient gate&#8208;tunable hot&#8208;hole photocurrent and high external quantum efficiency.








Abstract
Hot&#8208;carrier relaxation above the bandgap results in significant energy losses, making the extraction of hot carriers a critical challenge for efficient hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent generation in devices. In this study, we observe long&#8208;lived hot carriers in the metal&#8208;halide perovskite multiple quantum wells, (BA)2(MA)n&#8722;1PbnI3n+1 (n = 3), and demonstrate effective hot&#8208;hole photocurrent generation using 2D&#160;MoS&#8322; as an extraction layer. A high external quantum efficiency of short&#8208;circuit hot&#8208;carrier photocurrent of up to 35.4% is achieved. Further enhancement in photocurrent efficiency and open&#8208;circuit photovoltage is achieved when a gate electric field is applied, resulting in an external quantum efficiency of up to 61.9%. Evidence of hot&#8208;hole extraction is validated through operando transient reflection measurements on the working devices, with studies that depend on wavelength, carrier density, and gate voltage. DFT calculations on the heterostructure devices under different bias voltages further elucidate the mechanism of hot&#8208;hole extraction enhancement. These findings underscore the potential of perovskite multiple quantum wells as long&#8208;lived hot&#8208;carrier generators and highlight the role of 2D transition metal dichalcogenide semiconductors as efficient hot&#8208;carrier extraction electrodes for low&#8208;power optoelectronics.

         <title>In&#8208;Plane Adaptive Heteroepitaxy of 2D Cesium Bismuth Halides with Engineered Bandgaps on c&#8208;Sapphire</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D Cs2Bi3X9 (X = Br, Cl, I) perovskite crystals with variable lattice constants and engineered bandgaps are synthesized via adaptive heteroepitaxy on c&#8208;sapphire substrates. Photodetectors based on these epitaxial crystals exhibit significantly improved photodetection performance, indicating the effectiveness of epitaxial growth strategy for high&#8208;quality crystals. This work advances the integration of multicomponent 2D materials on dielectric substrates for optoelectronic applications.








Abstract
The heteroepitaxy of 2D materials with engineered bandgaps are crucial to broaden the spectral response for their integrated optoelectronic devices. However, it is a challenge to achieve the high&#8208;oriented epitaxy and integration of multicomponent 2D materials with varying lattice constants on the same substrate due to the limitation of lattice matching. Here, in&#8208;plane adaptive heteroepitaxy of a series of high&#8208;oriented 2D cesium bismuth halide (Cs3Bi2X9, X = I, Br, Cl) single crystals with varying lattice constants from 8.41 to 7.71 &#197; is achieved on c&#8208;plane sapphire with distinct lattice constant of 4.76 &#197; at a low temperature of 160&#160;&#176;C in an air ambient, benefiting from tolerable interfacial strain by switching compressive stress to tensile stress during a 30&#176; rotation of crystal orientation. First&#8208;principles calculation demonstrates that those are all thermodynamically stable phases, deriving from multiple minima of interfacial energy between single crystals and sapphire substrate. The detectivity of Cs3Bi2I9 photodetector reaches up to 3.7 &#215; 1012 Jones, deriving from high single&#8208;crystal quality. This work provides a promising experimental strategy and basic theory to boost the heteroepitaxy and integration of 2D single crystals with varying lattice constants on low&#8208;cost dielectric substrate, paving the way for their applications in integrated optoelectronics.

         <title>Manipulation of Unconventional Spin Polarization in Non&#8208;Collinear Exchange&#8208;Spring Magnetic Structures</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is formed by the coupling of perpendicular CoTb and in&#8208;plane Co films. When a spin current with the y&#8208;polarization flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field gives rise to unconventional x&#8208; and z&#8208; spin polarizations, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching.








Abstract
Manipulating the polarization of spin current is essential for understanding the mechanism of charge&#8208;to&#8208;spin conversion and achieving efficient electrically driven magnetization switching. Here, a novel exchange&#8208;spring magnetic structure is introduced formed by the coupling of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) CoTb and in&#8208;plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) Co films. When a spin current with the polarization along the y&#8208;direction flows through this exchange&#8208;spring (x&#8208;z plane) structure, the interaction between the y&#8208;spin and the local exchange field with a non&#8208;collinear spatial distribution gives rise to substantial unconventional spin polarizations in the x&#8208; and z&#8208;directions, enabling field&#8208;free spin&#8208;orbit torque driven perpendicular magnetization switching at room temperature. More importantly, the polarization directions of this unconventional spin current can be reversed depending on whether the interfacial exchange coupling is ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic. This work establishes a platform to explore emergent mechanisms for manipulating unconventional spin polarization with rich non&#8208;collinear magnetic exchange spin structures.

         <title>Efficient Targeted Regulation of the Interfaces and Bulk in Inverted Perovskite Solar Cells With a [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based Derivative</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Post&#8208;treatment involving the incorporation of a novel solution&#8208;processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208; derivative, (TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B), is proposed to simultaneously optimize the interfaces and bulk of inverted perovskite solar cells. TBA2B enhances the power conversion efficiency to 25.59% while improving the stability, thereby providing valuable insights for the design of efficient [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8208;&#8208;based interface materials and modification mechanisms.








Abstract
The performance and stability of inverted perovskite solar cells (PSCs) is adversely affected by the recombination loss, ion migration, and residual stress arising from issues within the bulk and at the cathode interface. Using simple post&#8208;treatment with a novel solution&#8208;processable derivative of the dodecahydro&#8208;closo&#8208;dodecaborate anion ([closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;)&#8212;(TBA)2[B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH] (TBA2B)&#8212;it is simultaneously address these issues. In inverted PSCs, the cationic and anionic components of TBA2B uniquely self&#8208;separate by positioning themselves precisely to perform their specific modification functions. The majority of [B12H11(OCH2CH2)2OH]2&#8208; anions reside at the (6,6)&#8208;phenyl&#8208;C61 butyric acid methyl ester (PCBM)/Ag interface, which enhances the electrical and physical contact. Additionally, a substantial fraction of tetrabutylammonium&#160;cations diffuse into the perovskite/PCBM heterojunction, enabling comprehensive control over the trap passivation, stress release, ion migration elimination, and grain boundary reinforcement through the in situ formation of 1D TBAPbI3 on the surface of the perovskite crystals. The TBA2B devices exhibit high power conversion efficiency of 25.59% and open&#8208;circuit voltage of 1.199&#160;V, performance that is among the highest achieved with a solution&#8208;processed perovskite/PCBM heterojunction. Furthermore, TBA2B significantly enhances the device's stability. This study provides crucial insights into the design of efficient and solution processable [closo&#8208;B12H12]2&#8722;&#8208;based interface materials, and offers a comprehensive understanding of the underlying modification mechanisms.

         <title>Interfacial Metal&#8208;Solvent Chelation for Direct Regeneration of LiFePO4 Cathode Black Mass</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
To address interfacial challenges in spent LiFePO4&#160;(LFP) black mass, such as structural deterioration and residual impurities, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation strategy leveraging the strong chelation of the Acac&#8722; anion is presented. This approach enables effective spent LFP regeneration by surface reconstruction of the degraded LFP with reducing lithium diffusion barriers and enhancing lithium supplementation.








Abstract
Direct regeneration of spent lithium&#8208;ion batteries presents a promising approach to effectively reuse valuable resources and benefit the environment. Unlike controlled laboratory conditions that commonly facilitate impurity purification and minimize structural damage, the LiFePO4 cathode black mass faces significant interfacial challenges, including structure deterioration, cathode&#8208;electrolyte interphase residues, and damage from storage procedures, which hinder lithium replenishment and structure regeneration. Here, a metal&#8208;solvent chelation reaction using a lithium acetylacetonate solution is introduced to address these challenges under ambient conditions. This method regulates the near&#8208;surface structure through strong chelation between Acac&#8210; anions and Fe (III) elements, thus effectively eliminating the degraded amorphous phase and residual fluorine compounds. By direct lithium connection and reducing diffusion barriers, the reconstructed surface facilitates the re&#8208;lithiation process. The regenerated LiFePO4 cathodes demonstrate a capacity retention of 88.5% after 400 cycles at 1 C, while also outperforming traditional recycling methods in terms of environmental and economic benefits. This approach provides a promising solution for regenerating degraded LiFePO4 cathodes from actual dismantled black mass, thereby accelerating the practical application of battery recycling.

         <title>Polymorphing Hydrogels Regulated by Photo&#8208;reactive DNA Cross&#8208;links</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA crosslinks act as a regulator in morphing of the hydrogels, adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light. Spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features of the polymorphing hydrogels within a one&#8208;pot system offer advanced solutions for applications in soft robotics and 4D printing.








Abstract
Polymorphing hydrogels can morph into another structure on demand with reprogrammable features. This concept extends the degree of morphing beyond that of traditional shape&#8208;morphing hydrogels, which predetermine their morphing capabilities at the fabrication stage. However, current polymorphing hydrogels face limitations due to the need for complex, non&#8208;sustained responsiveness or additional chemical steps for reconfigurable morphing. Here, photo&#8208;reactive DNA&#8208;cross&#8208;linked polymorphing hydrogels are presented that enable polymorphing under patterned light. The photo&#8208;reactive DNA cross&#8208;links act as a regulator in changing the shapes of the hydrogels by adjusting the lengths of the cross&#8208;links depending on the wavelength of light, which allows precise and dynamic morphing in a programmable way through a one&#8208;pot reaction. The high programmability involving spatiotemporal controllability and reprogrammable features offers advanced solutions for multifunctional soft machines and applications requiring complex processes.

An all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to facilitate enhanced dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with a programmable logic gate. The encryption imaging sensing system employing PDs array achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate is capable of executing six distinct logical functions.








Abstract
As the focus on information security continues to intensify, encrypted imaging sensing technology becomes increasingly indispensable. However, the widespread application of encrypted imaging sensing technology is hindered by high manufacturing costs and complex system construction. Herein, an all&#8208;inorganic perovskite/perovskite tandem self&#8208;powered photodetector (PDs) is reported, incorporated with Bi2TeO6 layer to enahnce dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect, to realize an innovated encryption imaging sensing system with programmable logic gate. The PDs reach responsivity of 1.46 A W&#8722;1 and detectivity of 3.44 &#215; 1013 Jones, the corresponding EQE reaches 342%, which is &#8776;75.48 times greater than that without pyro&#8208;phototronic effect. The outstanding performance resulting from dual pyro&#8208;phototronic effect in Cs2PbI2Cl2 perovskite and Bi2TeO6/CsSn0.5Pb0.5IBr2 interface, and optimizing band arrangement from the oxidized Bi2TeO6 layer. The photovoltaic and pyro&#8208;phototronic signal of PDs can still be clearly distinguished under 8 kHz pulsed laser. More importantly, the encryption imaging sensing system achieves simultaneous outputs of triple image information, and their programmable optoelectronic logic gate can execute&#160;six distinct logical functions, including &#8220;OR&#8221;, &#8220;AND&#8221;, &#8220;XOR&#8221;, &#8220;NAND&#8221;, &#8220;NOR&#8221; and &#8220;XNOR&#8221;. This research not only provides a feasible strategy for realizing the outstanding pyro&#8208;phototronic effect of all&#8208;inorganic perovskite materials, but also presents novel insights for designing&#160;encrypted imaging sensing technology.

         <title>Modulation in Spin State of Co3O4 Decorated Fe Single Atom Enables a Superior Rechargeable Zinc&#8208;Air Battery Performance</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The Co3O4 nanoparticles are invited to anchor on Fe1&#8208;NC. It is found the spin state of Fe and Co is effectively modulated. Thereby, a boosted ORR and OER performance is achieved for Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC proved by 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 in the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB test.








Abstract
High&#8208;performance bifunctional electrocatalyst for oxygen evolution reaction (OER) and oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) is the keystone for the industrialization of rechargeable zinc&#8208;air battery (ZAB). In this work, the modulation in the spin state of Fe single atom on nitrogen doped carbon&#160;(Fe1&#8208;NC) is devised by Co3O4 (Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC), and a mediate spin state is recorded. Besides, the d band center of Fe is downshifted associated with the increment in eg filling revealing the weakened interaction with OH* moiety, resulting in a boosted ORR performance. The ORR kinetic current density of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 2.0&#8208; and 5.6 times higher than Fe1&#8208;NC and commercial Pt/C, respectively. Moreover, high spin state is found for Co in Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC contributing to the accelerated surface reconstruction of Co3O4 witnessed by operando Raman and electrochemical impedance spectroscopies. A robust OER activity with overpotential of 352&#160;mV at 50&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 is achieved, decreased by 18 and 60&#160;mV by comparison with Co3O4@NC and IrO2. The operando Raman reveals a balanced adsorption of OH* species and its deprotonation leading to robust stability. The ZAB performance of Co3O4@Fe1&#8208;NC is 193.2&#160;mW cm&#8722;2 and maintains for 200&#160;h. Furthermore, the all&#8208;solid&#8208;state ZAB shows a promising battery performance of 163.1&#160;mW cm&#8722;2.

         <title>Composition&#8208;Graded Nitride Ferroelectrics Based Multi&#8208;Level Non&#8208;Volatile Memory for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN multi&#8208;level memory is demonstrated, showing a storage capacity up to 7&#8208;bit, and one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced operating voltage tuning window compared to uniform composition devices. This approach paves the way for advanced integration of wurtzite ferroelectrics in multifunctional computing systems.








Abstract
Multi&#8208;level non&#8208;volatile ferroelectric memories are emerging as promising candidates for data storage and neuromorphic computing applications, due to the enhancement of storage density and the reduction of energy and space consumption. Traditional multi&#8208;level operations are achieved by utilizing intermediary polarization states, which exhibit an unpredictable ferroelectric domain switching nature, leading to unstable multi&#8208;level memory. In this study, a unique approach of composition&#8208;graded ferroelectric ScAlN to achieve tunable operating voltage in a wide range and attain precise control of domain switching and stable multi&#8208;level memory is proposed. This non&#8208;volatile memory supports multi&#8208;level storage up to 7&#8208;bit capacities, and exhibits enhanced performance compared to the uniform composition device, showing one order of magnitude higher ON/OFF ratio, 30% reduced working voltage, and up to 50% enhanced tuning window of operating voltage. Finally, the emulation of long&#8208;term plasticity and linear weight update akin to biological synapse with high uniformity and reliability are demonstrated. The proposed composition&#8208;grading architecture offers new opportunities for next&#8208;generation multi&#8208;level ferroelectric memories, paving the way for advanced hybrid integration in multifunctional computing systems.

         <title>Improved Efficiency and Stability in Pure&#8208;Red CdSe Nanoplatelet LEDs Enabled by Gradient Alloyed CdSeS/CdZnS Crown/Shell</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
This study designes a gradient crown on the side facets of CdSe nanoplatelets to address the issue of high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures. Consequently, a gradient alloyed shell is successfully grown, and the core/crown/shell nanoplatelets exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield and high stability. Therefore, the prepared nanoplatelets light&#8208;emitting diodes demonstrates a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1%.








Abstract
Anisotropic nanoplatelets (NPLs) possess strong in&#8208;plane transition dipole moments and out&#8208;of&#8208;plane emission, which enable a maximum photon out&#8208;coupling efficiency of 40% and a high gain coefficient, making them ideal candidates for light&#8208;emitting diodes (LEDs) and lasers. However, the unbalanced surface energy between the side and top facets of NPLs results in poor thermal stability and high susceptibility to ripening at elevated temperatures, which complicates the growth of the shell. To address this issue, a gradient crown (CdSeS) around the CdSe NPLs is designed to stabilize the high energy side facets. Consequently, the gradient alloyed shell (CdZnS) is successfully grown, and the CdSe/CdSeS/CdZnS core/crown/shell NPLs exhibited near&#8208;unity photoluminescence quantum yield. The CdSeS/CdZnS crown/shell structure suppressed non&#8208;radiative Auger recombinations, achieving a record&#8208;low amplification spontaneous emission threshold of 2.11 &#181;J&#160;cm&#8722;2 under femtosecond laser excitation. In addition, by selecting the carrier transport layers with matched energy levels, the NPL&#8208;LEDs demonstrate a record&#8208;high external quantum efficiency of 30.1% in the pure&#8208;red range, driven by the 94% in&#8208;plane transition dipole moment distribution of NPL film. The NPL&#8208;LEDs also exhibited a long operational lifetime of T95 &gt; 600 h at a luminance of 1000 cd&#160;m&#8722;2.

A self&#8208;floating plasmonic sponge that harvests full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum light for highly efficient water purification.








Abstract
Solving the global challenge of freshwater scarcity is of great significance for over one billion people in the world. Solar water evaporation based on plasmonic nanostructures is one of the most promising technologies due to its high efficiency. However, the efficiency of this plasmonic nanostructure&#8208;based technology can hardly achieve 100%. Therefore, it is highly desired to develop new solar converters utilizing plasmonic local heating and reasonable structure design to break the limit of solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency for freshwater production. Here, a plasmonic sponge is developed as a solar evaporation converter with excellent full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, good heat localization performance, and fast evaporation kinetics through 3D nanostructures, achieving a 131% solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. Distinct from the traditional 2D localized heating&#8208;based evaporation and nonmetallic 3D water evaporation, the 3D plasmonic sponge can simultaneously achieve highly efficient local heating and super large water&#8211;air interfaces for boosting solar&#8208;to&#8208;vapor efficiency. The 3D plasmonic sponge can be also used as a universal converter for purifying seawater, metal ion solutions, organic pollutant solutions, and strong acid and strong alkaline solutions. The full&#8208;solar&#8208;spectrum absorption, high efficiency, and universality in water purification suggest that the novel 3D plasmonic solar converter can bring a significant way to alleviate the crisis of freshwater resources.

         <title>Bias&#8208;Switchable Photodetection and Photosynapse Dual&#8208;Functional Devices Based on 2D Perovskite/Organic Heterojunction for Imaging&#8208;to&#8208;Recognition Conversion</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Optoelectronic devices integrating visual imaging and recognition functions are achieved by employing 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunction. Through switching bias to modulate carrier and oxygen vacancy dynamics, the device exhibits photodetection property at zero bias and photosynaptic property at negative bias. This work provides a novel strategy to achieve low&#8208;power consumption, easy&#8208;switchable and functional integrated optoelectronic devices for artificial visual system.








Abstract
Optoelectronic devices with imaging and recognition capabilities are crucial for developing artificial visual system (AVS). Bias&#8208;switchable photodetection and photosynaptic devices have been developed using 2D perovskite oxide/organic heterojunctions. This unique structure allows for modulated carrier dynamics under varied bias conditions, enabling the devices to function as photodetectors without bias and as photosynapses with bias. At zero bias, the device achieves high responsivity (&#8776;0.36 A W&#8722;1 at 320 nm) and rapid response speed (0.57 s). Under a &#8722;0.5 V bias, it exhibits persistent photoconductivity (PPC), resulting in neuromorphic synaptic behaviors with a paired&#8208;pulse facilitation (PPF) index exceeding 300%. Moreover, an 8 &#215; 8 sensor array demonstrates image sensing and memory capabilities, showing in situ enhanced imaging when switching the bias from 0 to &#8722;0.5 V, and over 200 s of image memory. The image processing and recognition abilities are further explored by constructing an AVS using a 28 &#215; 28 device array combined with an artificial neural network (ANN). The adjustable synaptic weight under different reverse biases allowed for optimized simulated recognition, achieving an accuracy of 92% after 160 training epochs. This work presents a novel method for creating dual&#8208;functional photodetection and photosynaptic devices, paving the way for a more integrated and efficient AVS.

         <title>Boron Trioxide&#8208;Assisted Post&#8208;Annealing Enables Vertical Oriented Recrystallization of Sb2Se3 Thin Film for High&#8208;Efficiency Solar Cells</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
In this study, B2O3 coating layer is used as a flux for Sb2Se3 recrystallization, inducing a vertical orientation growth of the film while suppressing the defect of Se vacancies. The orientation control and passivation of defects enables efficient transport of carriers, resulting in the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells fabricated by thermal evaporation method.








Abstract
Crystallization process is critical for enhancing the crystallinity, regulating the crystal orientation of polycrystalline thin films, as well as repairing defects within the films. For quasi&#8208;1D Sb2Se3 photovoltaic materials, the preparation of Sb2Se3 thin films still faces great challenges in adjusting orientation and defect properties, which limits the device performance. In this study, a novel post&#8208;treatment strategy is developed that uses a low melting point B2O3 coating layer as a flux to drive the recrystallization of Sb2Se3, thereby regulating the micro&#8208;orientation of thermal evaporation&#8208;derived Sb2Se3 films and optimizing their electrical properties. Mechanistic investigations show that B2O3 exhibits stronger adsorption with (hk1) planes of Sb2Se3 to induce a vertical orientation growth of the film, while blocking the volatilization channels of Se and inhibiting Se vacancy defects by interacting with Sb2Se3. The Sb2Se3 film with [hk1] preferential orientation and suppressed deep&#8208;level defects promotes the effective transport of charge carriers in solar cells. As a result, the B2O3&#8208;treated device delivers a champion efficiency of 9.37% without MgF2 anti&#8208;reflection coating, which is currently the highest efficiency in Sb2Se3 solar cells achieved by thermal evaporation method. This study provides a new method and mechanism for regulating optical and electrical properties of low&#8208;dimensional inorganic thin films.

         <title>Laser&#8208;Induced Regeneration of Spent LiMn2O4 Cathode Into High&#8208;Performance Ni&#8208;Doped LiMn2O4 Cathode</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
An efficient laser&#8208;assisted regeneration process is developed to convert spent LiMn2O4 cathodes into performance&#8208;enhanced, Ni&#8208;doped cathodes. Surface Ni doping enhances interfacial processes and prevents capacity loss at lower temperatures by forming a new interface with a reduced charge transfer energy barrier. This innovative approach offers a sustainable solution for regenerating spent lithium&#8208;ion battery cathodes.








Abstract
The rapid increase in lithium&#8208;ion battery (LIB) production, fueled by the rise of electric vehicles, highlights significant challenges in managing end&#8208;of&#8208;life LIBs, particularly regarding environmental impact and waste management. Traditional recycling methods, such as pyrometallurgical and hydrometallurgical processes, are energy&#8208;intensive and consume substantial reagents. In this study, a laser&#8208;assisted regeneration method is introduced for LiMn2O4 (LMO) cathodes, enabling in situ Ni doping into spent LMO cathodes (r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni) to enhance electrochemical performance. Surface Ni&#8208;doping improves interfacial processes and reduces capacity loss at lower temperatures by creating a new interface with a lower charge transfer energy barrier. The r&#8208;LMO&#8208;Ni cathode surpasses pristine LMO cathodes, achieving a specific capacity of 112.95&#160;mA h g&#8722;1 at 1 C and retaining 95.1% of its capacity after 200 cycles at 0 &#176;C. A techno&#8208;economic analysis supports the feasibility of this laser&#8208;assisted regeneration approach, offering an innovative pathway for upcycling spent cathodes and developing next&#8208;generation Mn&#8208;based cathodes.

         <title>Synthesis of Highly Anisotropic 2D Insulator CrOCl Nanosheets for Interfacial Symmetry Breaking in Isotropic 2D Semiconductors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Highly anisotropic 2D insulator CrOCl nanosheets are synthesized via space&#8208;confined chemical vapor deposition growth. A MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single&#8208;mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, which endows its device with polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect. This study opens new prospects for exploring CrOCl&#8208;based physics and electronics via symmetry engineering.









Abstract
Chromium oxychloride (CrOCl), a van der Waals antiferromagnetic insulator, has attracted significant interest in 2D optoelectronic, ferromagnetic, and quantum devices. However, the bottom&#8211;up preparation of 2D CrOCl remains challenging, limiting its property exploration and device application. Herein, the controllable synthesis of 2D CrOCl crystals by chemical vapor deposition is demonstrated. The combination reaction of precursors together with the space&#8208;confined growth strategy, providing stable and stoichiometric growth conditions, enable a robust synthesis of high&#8208;crystallinity CrOCl nanosheets with regular rhombus&#8208;like morphology and uniform thickness. By tuning the growth temperature from 675 to 800&#160;&#176;C, the thickness of CrOCl nanosheets can be continuously modulated from 10.2 to 30.8&#160;nm, with the domain size increasing from 16.9 to 25.5&#160;&#181;m. The as&#8208;grown CrOCl nanosheets exhibit significant structural/optical anisotropy, ultrahigh insulativity, and superior air stability. Furthermore, a MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure with single&#8208;mirror symmetry stacking and ultrastrong interfacial coupling is built to realize interfacial symmetry breaking, a novel interface phenomenon that converts MoS2 from isotropy to anisotropy. Consequently, the MoS2/CrOCl heterostructure device achieves polarization&#8208;sensitive photodetection and bulk photovoltaic effect, which are nonexistent in high&#8208;symmetry 2D materials. This work paves the way for the future exploration of CrOCl&#8208;based 2D physics and devices via symmetry engineering.

         <title>A Neuronal Signal Sorting and Amplifying Nanosensor for EEG&#8208;Concordant Imaging&#8208;Guided Precision Epilepsy Ablation</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor integrates real&#8208;time, dynamically reversible potassium ion (K&#8314;) fluorescence imaging (FI) with high&#8208;resolution structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This enables electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of hidden epileptic foci and guides minimally invasive radiofrequency ablation on mice with drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, resulting in sustained seizure control and improved cognitive outcomes.









Abstract
Surgery remains an essential treatment for managing drug&#8208;resistant focal epilepsy, but its accessibility and efficacy are limited in patients without distinct structural abnormalities on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Potassium ion (K+), a critical marker for seizure&#8208;associated neuronal signaling, shows significant promise for designing sensors targeting hidden epileptic foci. However, existing sensors cannot cross the blood&#8208;brain barrier and lack the ability to specifically enrich and amplify K+ signals in the brain with high temporal and spatial resolution. Here, an intravenously administered neuronal signal sorting and amplifying nanosensor (NSAN) is reported that combines real&#8208;time dynamic reversible K+ fluorescence imaging with high&#8208;resolution structural MRI, enabling electroencephalogram&#8208;concordant imaging of MRI&#8208;negative epileptic foci. Guided by NSANs, minimally invasive surgery is successfully performed in both intrahippocampal kainic acid (KA) epilepsy model with foci confined to the ipsilateral hippocampus, and intraperitoneal KA model where foci are randomly distributed, resulting in sustained seizure control and cognitive improvement. These findings highlight the NSAN as a transformative tool for visualizing hidden epileptic foci, thereby broadening eligibility for minimally invasive and precision surgical intervention.

         <title>Synergistic Multimodal Energy Dissipation Enhances Certified Efficiency of Flexible Organic Photovoltaics beyond 19%</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By combining multimodal energy dissipation and phase modulation in active layer films, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible electronics are innovatively co&#8208;developed to achieve a certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 19.07%, which is the highest PCE reported for flexible organic photovoltaic device to date.








Abstract
All&#8208;polymer organic solar cells (OSCs) have shown unparalleled application potential in the field of flexible wearable electronics in recent years due to the excellent mechanical and photovoltaic properties. However, the small molecule acceptors after polymerization in still retain some mechanical and aggregation properties of the small molecule, falling short of the ductility requirements for flexible devices. Here, based on the multimodal energy dissipation theory, the mechanical and photovoltaic properties of flexible devices are co&#8208;enhanced by adding the thermoplastic elastomer material (polyurethane, PU) to the PM6:PBQx&#8208;TF:PY&#8208;IT&#8208;based active layer films. The construction of multi&#8208;fiber network structure and the decrease of films&#8217; residual stresses contribute to the enhancement of carrier transport properties and the decrease of defect state density. Eventually, the PCE (power conversion efficiency) of 19.40% is achieved on the flexible devices with an effective area of 0.102 cm2, and the third&#8208;party certified PCE reaches 19.07%, which is the highest PCE for flexible OSCs currently available. To further validate the potential of this strategy for large&#8208;area module applications, the 25&#8208;cm2&#8208;based flexible and super&#8208;flexible modules are prepared with the PCEs of 15.48% and 14.61%, respectively, and demonstration applications are implemented.

         <title>High Efficiency (&gt;10%) AgBiS2 Colloidal Nanocrystal Solar Cells with Diketopyrrolopyrrole&#8208;Based Polymer Hole Transport Layer</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A new BD2FCT material is developed as an advanced HTL tailored for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells through precise molecular engineering. This new polymer effectively reduces charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces, thereby leading to enhanced charge extraction. Incorporation of the IEICO&#8208;4F into BD2FCT further improves charge funneling and absorption, resulting in a notable 10.1% PCE for AgBiS2 CNC solar cells.








Abstract
Silver bismuth disulfide (AgBiS2) colloidal nanocrystals (CNCs) have emerged as ecofriendly photoactive materials with excellent photoconductivity and high absorption coefficients, in compliance with the restriction of hazardous substances (RoHS) guidelines. To maximize the theoretical potential of AgBiS2 CNC solar cells, a new diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP)&#8208;based polymer, BD2FCT, optimized as a hole transport layer (HTL), is developed. This asymmetric thiophene&#8208;rich polymer HTL effectively complements the optical absorption spectrum of CNCs and forms a homogeneous layer atop the CNCs, facilitating favorable vertical charge transfer through intrinsic molecular packing. Furthermore, the BD2FCT HTL aligns energetically with AgBiS2, significantly reducing charge recombination at the CNC/HTL interfaces and enhancing charge extraction and photocurrent generation across the entire optical absorption spectrum. These characteristics are further optimized through precise molecular engineering. Additionally, a low&#8208;bandgap acceptor, IEICO&#8208;4F, is structurally incorporated with the BD2FCT polymer to further improve charge funneling and complementary absorption. Transient absorption spectroscopy reveals enhanced hole transfer from CNC to BD2FCT&#8208;29DPP:IEICO&#8208;4F, resulting in reduced charge recombination and efficient charge extraction. Consequently, a BD2FCT&#8208;based AgBiS2 CNC solar cell achieves a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 10.1%, demonstrating significant improvements in short&#8208;circuit current density (JSC) and fill factor (FF).

         <title>Retroreflective Multichrome Microdome Arrays Created by Single&#8208;Step Reflow</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Arrays of microdomes with varying radii are formed by transforming micropillars made of the positive photoresist through a single&#8208;step reflow process. These inverted microdomes exhibit radius&#8208;dependent structural colors via total internal reflection and optical interference. By controlling the density and size of the microdomes, retroreflective multicolor graphics are achieved with exceptional color representation and resolution.








Abstract
Structural colors are known for their tunability, fade resistance, and eco&#8208;friendliness. Recent advancements have shown that such colors can be efficiently produced using total internal reflection (TIR) on high&#8208;refractive&#8208;index convex microstructures without the need for periodic nanostructures. However, a reproducible, fast, and programmable production strategy for these microstructures is essential for commercial applications. Here, a single&#8208;step method is reported for creating multicolor patterns by transforming photolithographically&#8208;patterned micropillars into microdomes through thermal reflow. These micropillars, uniform in height but varying in diameter, are converted into microdomes that differ in diameter and height, which display a full spectrum of structural colors, creating a versatile color palette. This process enables the production of high&#8208;resolution multicolor graphics using a rainbow color set, with high reproducibility. Additionally, by mixing distinct microdomes and adjusting their densities, a rich variety of color presentations can be achieved, enabling the recreation of arbitrary color images with microdome arrays. The variable heights of the microdomes also allow for dynamic discoloration or color changes through mechanical compression. The high reproducibility and scalability of this method hold significant commercial promise for various optical applications.

         <title>Self&#8208;Healing Yet Strong Actuator Materials with Muscle&#8208;Like Diastole and Contraction via Multilevel Relaxations</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
A mechanical robust and healable actuator material with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities is fabricated by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction endow obtained artificial muscle with high output actuation and robust mechanical properties, exceeding typical natural muscles, which pave&#160;the way for advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.








Abstract
Skeletal muscles represent a role model in soft robotics featuring agile locomotion and incredible mechanical robustness. However, existing actuators lack an optimal combination of actuation parameters (including actuation modes, work capacity, mechanical strength, and damage repair) to rival biological tissues. Here, a biomimetic structural design strategy via multilevel relaxations (&#945;/&#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation) modulation is proposed for mechanical robust and healable actuator materials with muscle&#8208;like diastole and contraction abilities by orientational alignment of dendritic polyphenol&#8208;modified nano&#8208;assembles in eutectogels. The anisotropic hierarchical micro&#8208;nanostructures assembled by supramolecular interaction mimic the relative slippage of actin filaments and myosin in muscles, ensuring bistable actuation through rapid thermal &#945;&#8208;relaxation and expansion. Furthermore, kinetically active secondary &#946;/&#947;/&#948;&#8208;relaxation at reconfigurable interfaces can conquer the limited self&#8208;healing ability of fixed&#8208;orientation polymeric chains. The obtained artificial muscle exhibits high output actuation, robust mechanical properties (tensile strength of 33.5&#160;MPa), and desired functional, mechanical self&#8208;healing efficiency (89.7%), exceeding typical natural muscles in living systems. The bionic micro&#8208;nano design strategy achieves bottom&#8208;up cooperative relaxation modulation to integrate all&#8208;round performance of natural muscles, which paves the way for substantial advancements in next&#8208;generation intelligent robotics.

         <title>Breaking the Trade&#8208;Off Between Mobility and On&#8211;Off Ratio in Oxide Transistors</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Mild CF4 plasma is introduced to resolve the trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio &#160;in degenerate oxide semiconductors without the need for thermal annealing. This technique effectively reduces carrier density, achieving a high Ion/Ioff ratio (10&#8312;) while preserving high mobility (104 cm2 V&#8722;1s&#8722;1) of thick In2O3 transistors, leading to enhanced switching performance and making it ideal for three&#8208;dimensional&#160;integration in advanced electronic devices.








Abstract
Amorphous oxide semiconductors (AOS) are pivotal for next&#8208;generation electronics due to their high electron mobility and excellent optical properties. However, In2O3, a key material in this family, encounters significant challenges in balancing high mobility and effective switching as its thickness is scaled down to nanometer dimensions. The high electron density in ultra&#8208;thin In2O3 hinders its ability to turn off effectively, leading to a critical trade&#8208;off between mobility and the on&#8208;current (Ion)/off&#8208;current (Ioff) ratio. This study introduces a mild CF4 plasma doping technique that effectively reduces electron density in 10&#160;nm In2O3 at a low processing temperature of 70&#160;&#176;C, achieving a high mobility of 104 cm2 V&#8315;&#185; s&#8315;&#185; and an Ion/Ioff ratio exceeding 10&#8312;. A subsequent low&#8208;temperature post&#8208;annealing further improves the critical reliability and stability of CF4&#8208;doped In2O3 without raising the thermal budget, making this technique suitable for monolithic three&#8208;dimensional (3D) integration. Additionally, its application is demonstrated in In2O3 depletion&#8208;load inverters, highlighting its potential for advanced logic circuits and broader electronic and optoelectronic applications.

         <title>Asymmetric Structural MXene/PBO Aerogels for High&#8208;Performance Electromagnetic Interference Shielding with Ultra&#8208;Low Reflection</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
By means of in situ growth method, heterostructure MXene@Ni electromagnetic functional fillers with good impedance matching performance are prepared by &#8220;electrostatic adsorption&#8208;solvothermal reduction&#8221;. And the obtained asymmetric structural (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8208;(MXene/PNF) aerogels prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept present high&#8208;performance electromagnetic interference shielding with ultra&#8208;low reflection and infrared camouflage.








Abstract
Electromagnetic interference (EMI) shielding materials with low electromagnetic (EM) waves reflection characteristics are ideal materials for blocking EM radiation and pollution. Materials with low reflectivity must be constructed using materials with excellent EM waves absorption properties. However, materials simultaneously possessing both low reflectivity and excellent EMI shielding performance remain scarce, consequently, multilayer structures need to be developed. Poly(p&#8208;phenylene&#8211;2,6&#8211;benzobisoxazole) nanofibers (PNF) are prepared by deprotonation. PNF are combined with MXene and heterostructure MXene@Ni prepared by in&#8208;situ growth; MXene@Ni/PNF acts as an EM absorption layer while MXene/PNF acts as an EM reflective layer. Finally, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels are prepared by layer&#8208;by&#8208;layer freeze&#8208;drying based on the layered modular design concept. Experimental characterizations revealed that (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels enable the efficient absorption&#8208;reflection&#8208;reabsorption of EM waves, effectively eliminating EMI. When the mass ratio of MXene to Ni in MXene@Ni is 1:6 and the mass fraction of MXene in the reflective layer is 80 wt.%, the (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels exhibit excellent EMI shielding performance (71 dB) and a very low reflection coefficient (R = 0.10). Finite element simulations verified that the developed asymmetric structural aerogels achieve high EMI shielding performance with low reflection characteristics. In addition, (MXene@Ni/PNF)&#8211;(MXene/PNF) aerogels display excellent infrared camouflage ability.

         <title>Structure&#8208;Induced Energetic Coordination Compounds as Additives for Laser Initiation Primary Explosives</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
Energetic coordination compounds (ECCs) are first used as additives to lead azide (LA) to design laser ignition primary explosives. These laser&#8208;sensitive mixed composites exhibit remarkable initiating ability, extremely low laser initiation threshold (Emin), fast response times (Tmin), and acceptable stabilities. The strategy can broaden new application scenarios and unveil new perspectives for coordination compounds as additives in advanced laser pyrotechnics for aerospace applications.








Abstract
Laser ignition of primary explosives presents more reliable alternative to traditional electrical initiation methods. However, the commercial initiator lead azide (LA) requires a high&#8208;power density laser to detonate, with the minimum laser initiation energy (Emin) of 2402 mJ. Currently, the laser&#8208;ignitable metal complex&#8208;based igniters still suffer from weak detonation capabilities and high Emin values. Here, the approach is first proposed to design laser ignition primary explosives within the high energy azide and tetrazole&#8208;based energetic coordination compounds (ECCs), [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(H2O)]2 1 and [Co(N3)(2&#8208;bmttz)(MeOH)]2 2 as additives to LA. Material 1e with 4&#160;wt.% of 1 in LA, exhibits ultra&#8208;low laser initiation threshold (Emin = 1.6 mJ) and ultrafast corresponding time (Tmin = 0.2&#160;ms). Specially, compared to LA, the threshold of 1e is as low as 1/1500 of that of LA. Moreover, 30&#160;mg 1e successfully detonates RDX with a laser energy of 1.6 mJ. Theoretical calculations and experiment results reveal that 1 exhibits the superior additive effect compared to 2, attributed to its more enhanced ability to generate free radicals and higher photothermal conversion efficiency under laser conditions. This work represents a paradigm shift, with the potential to develop a laser&#8208;driven micro&#8208;detonator combining powerful detonation capabilities with exceptionally low laser initiation energy.

         <title>Hollow Mo/MoSVn Nanoreactors with Tunable Built&#8208;in Electric Fields for Sustainable Hydrogen Production</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
The built&#8208;in electric fields (BIEFs) in the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors can be gradiently modulated via tailoring the sulfur vacancies, and exhibit parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities. Moderate BIEF evidently facilitates the hydrogen desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR, endowing the Mo/MoSV1 electrolyzer with superior activity and durability.








Abstract
Constructing built&#8208;in electric field (BIEF) in heterojunction catalyst is an effective way to optimize adsorption/desorption of reaction intermediates, while its precise tailor to achieve efficient bifunctional electrocatalysis remains great challenge. Herein, the hollow Mo/MoSVn nanoreactors with tunable BIEFs are elaborately prepared to simultaneously promote hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and urea oxidation reaction (UOR) for sustainable hydrogen production. The BIEF induced by sulfur vacancies can be modulated from 0.79 to 0.57 to 0.42&#160;mV nm&#8722;1, and exhibits a parabola&#8208;shaped relationship with HER and UOR activities, the Mo/MoSV1 nanoreactor with moderate BIEF presents the best bifunctional activity. Theoretical calculations reveal that the moderate BIEF can evidently facilitate the hydrogen adsorption/desorption in the HER and the breakage of N&#9472;H bond in the UOR. The electrolyzer assembled with Mo/MoSV1 delivers a cell voltage of 1.49&#160;V at 100&#160;mA cm&#8722;2, which is 437&#160;mV lower than that of traditional water electrolysis, and also presents excellent durability at 200&#160;mA cm&#8722;2 for 200&#160;h. Life cycle assessment indicates the HER||UOR system possesses notable superiority across various environment impact and energy consumption. This work can provide theoretical and experimental direction on the rational design of advanced materials for energy&#8208;saving and eco&#8208;friendly hydrogen production.

         <title>2D Conjugated Metal&#8208;Organic Frameworks for New Generation Flexible Multicolor Electrochromic Devices</title>
         <description>Advanced Materials, Volume 37, Issue 5, February 5, 2025. </description>
         <dc:description>
2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) are introduced as a novel class of multicolor electrochromic materials with significant potential for the next&#8208;generation flexible electrochromic devices (FMEDs). This perspective provides new insights into the coloring mechanisms and presents strategies for optimizing device performance, highlighting potential multidisciplinary applications in camera lenses, camouflage, displays, and wearable electronics.








Abstract
There has been considerable interest in 2D conductive conjugated MOFs (2D c&#8208;MOFs) for their potential applications in sensors, opto&#8208;electronics, catalysis, and energy storage, owing to their ultra&#8208;high specific surface area, relatively high electrical conductivity, and tunable pore channel sizes for ion/charge diffusion/adsorption. The unique advantages brought by systematic tunings in the metal nodes and organic ligands enable the creation of highly accessible and remarkable structures with diverse chemical and physical behaviors. While the 2D c&#8208;MOFs are being explored for the rapid widening spectrum of applications, in this work, the great potential of multicolor transitions and functional properties of these 2D c&#8208;MOFs are examined for the new generation of flexible multicolor electrochromic devices (FMEDs). Despite the rather limited and yet steady progress that has been made so far, 2D c&#8208;MOFs offer great opportunities in addressing the monotonous color switching, undesirable stability, as well as the sluggish kinetics of electron/ion transportation, which are typically encountered by the conventional electrochromic materials. Together with the main challenges that are being faced, this perspective provides a timely re&#8208;visit to the expected transition in the near future from the proof&#8208;of&#8208;concept demonstration to the eventual industrial&#8208;scale implementation of 2D c&#8208;MOFs in the new generation FEMDs.
